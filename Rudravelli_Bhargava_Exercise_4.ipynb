I know it wasn't when it came out, because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn't get enough of it. In hindsight, I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it; somehow, once the film had become the most successful movie ever (unadjusted for inflation) it stopped being cool to like James Cameron's eco-sci-fi extravaganza.Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story, unoriginal ideas and bland characters, as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados. \"FernGully in space\" or \"Dances With Wolves with blue cat-people\" are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure - which in all honesty I don't get.I mean, it's fine not to like the movie (all art is subjective and all that), but how so many self-professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture - which on Metacritic is rated even higher than 'The Dark Knight' - was nothing but a bland, unoriginal, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the (then) novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me.What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original, director-driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at 'Avatar': an original, director-driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties. \"The ideas in the film are not original\", they claim. Come on guys, seriously?So you've seen a world like Pandora before? A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests? A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness? You've seen many films about a bio-database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors?You've watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco-system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs? And by the way: how many \"eco-sci-fi\" films have you seen? Such a worn-out concept and tired old sub-genre, right?No my friends, in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come, and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons (like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information). But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight-forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci-fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience.To that end, the film uses certain well-known story tropes (\"the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy\"; \"the soldier who realizes he's been fighting for the wrong cause\"; \"the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he's invading\" or the timeless trope of \"the fish out of water\"), but they are not what the film is about. And those tropes are not copied from 'Dances With Wolves' either - any more than that film stole them from 'Pocahontas': they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history, from 'Lawrence of Arabia' to 'Shogun' or 'The Last Samurai' and countless others.And yes, our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters (though neither are they as bland as the film's most vicious detractors claim), but that's because they aren't really the film's main focus. 'Avatar's actual protagonist, its true star if you will, is Pandora. It's the WORLD we get to experience through Jake's eyes that really matters here, and the film aims straight for your gut - not your sci-fi nerd brain (which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans - now - claim to be disappointed with the film).More than anything, 'Avatar' wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand-in for our own threatened world, and the film is an unapologetic, uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature - as well as a call to action to preserve them. Which on an emotional level works marvelously: nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree, which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon. It's a genius scene, and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of \"Home Tree\" does in Cameron's film.So again (I'm trying to hammer my point home here ;-), 'Avatar' is simple? Yes, but that's the point: the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate; the themes are not just derivative re-treads, they're as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone. And that's exactly what Cameron's intention was: to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart-felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world. Which, given the film's success, it obviously did.Personally, I think 'Avatar' is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right, and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness. And while this may only have been my own individual experience, 'Avatar' was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater - which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D. It was also the last time a film managed to do that.And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular. It's a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top-notch CGI, filled with fascinating creatures and jaw-dropping future-tech, and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out, non-stop sci-fi action thrill-ride on a scale the world had rarely - if ever - seen before.Obviously that doesn't mean it's a perfect film, and as I already pointed out, it's fair not to like it for any number of reasons (above all: personal taste), but 'Avatar' is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days. Get over it people: simple doesn't equal simplistic, and the fact that 'Avatar' is neither subtle nor cynical doesn't make it dumb (even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed ;-).In all honesty, I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film - instead of the most successful movie of all time - many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci-fi adventure classic for the ages. And as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what 'Avatar' is: a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur. Rant over., Director James Cameron's return to the world of science fiction cinema is a glorious one indeed. Twelve years after delivering us the highest grossing film of all time, Cameron brings us the sci-fi epic Avatar, a film that is not only visually breathtaking, but also character driven, emotional, exciting, effective, and masterfully directed.The marketing and hype for this movie was mostly based around the groundbreaking visual effects, so I'll start there. I was lucky enough to get to see this film in a digital 3D theater. My only complaint is with myself, in that I wish I had seen a couple of 3D movies before this one. This was my first experience with a 3D film, so I really didn't have anything to compare it against, but all I knew from the very first shot of the movie was that this was going to be unlike anything I had ever seen before. At first it took me a while to adjust to the dimensions of the film, but after my eyes got used to what i was seeing, I realized that what I was looking at was not a 3D gimmick but a world with an incredible amount of depth. James Cameron rarely gets right in your face with the big things in this movie. He is more subtle than that. The things that appear to be directly in front of you (and they really do) are the little things that capture the ambiance of the scene and make you feel like you're there with the characters. The rest of the 3D effect serve to add dimensions and reality to the scenes.The visual achievement in this film is not in the action scenes (which are some of the most exciting I've ever seen) but in the lengths that were gone to to bring this world to life. James Cameron has created a planet, a species, and a culture that work in perfect harmony with each other, and likewise the visuals are in perfect harmony. I'll admit I was a little apprehensive that this movie was more computer animated than live action. To me that usually suggests that a film crew is getting lazy, and that it's going to look like a video game. That is not at all the case here. The truth is that without computer animation there is no other way this film would have looked this impeccable. The planet of Pandora is extremely beautiful and detailed, and the Na'vi species fit with it perfectly. In all honesty, you can in fact tell that the aliens are computer animated. They still haven't quite attained the ability to make CG characters that look absolutely 100% unquestionably real, and in a live action world they might still have suffered the out-of-place look that many CG characters in movie get. However, in the computer animated world of Pandora, they blend in seamlessly and beautifully. This is of course not to downplay the design of the na'vi. They look as real as you could possibly hope for. The nearness they have come to looking real, the motion capture used in this movie, the range of facial expressions and emotions that they show, are all unprecedented.All of that being said, the next big question about this movie is this: Are visual effects all it has to offer? My answer: Not at all. The depth of Avatar goes far beyond the visuals themselves.As with all of Cameron's movies, Avatar is character driven. The central characters of the film are all dynamic, well written, and very well acted. You go on an adventure with them and throughout the movie you fall in love them (or grow to despise them depending on which characters).The general plot-line of the movie is a bit generic but that's okay. No, the premise isn't anything completely brand new, but it's still an excellent plot, and one that is familiar to our society and very important for us to remember. Along with that there are still several aspects of the plot that are quite original. James Cameron took a familiar story, one that many storytellers before him have told version of, and made it his own. Furthermore, this is one of those movies where you predict things because you want to see them happen, and when your predictions turn out to come true it's gratifying. That's not to say that everything is predictable, because that would get old. Don't worry, Cameron has thrown in a fair amount of little surprises too.This film is also as much emotionally effective as it is visually effective. James Cameron is a master at getting a certain emotion or feeling out of his viewers, and every scene in the movie works toward one or more of these effects. It's very light-hearted at times, with a good bit of comedic relief, and then quite intense in other scenes. Some scenes make you fear for the main characters, or perhaps even for yourself. Much of the film is brimming with anticipation and suspense, and several scenes had me simply grinning with excitement.Overall this is one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had. Avatar is groundbreaking, dynamic, powerful, and a ton of fun. I must say it was worth the wait, but I certainly hope Cameron is here to stay this time.10/10, Unfortunately, I had to watch it in 2D, but even with that, this movie was just brilliant. I think we all know the basic outline of the story by now, and I admit, some of the movie's flaws is that the plot is somewhat predictable, and that it had some cliché moments and some cheesy dialogue, but nevertheless, I thought the movie was overall fantastic. We all know the SFX are the best ever (everyone pretty much has said that, so why bother?), but what you don't know is that the way the film is executed actually carries quite an emotional punch that most people won't be expecting, and all of the performances overall are great, even Worthington's (which is the first film I've seen him in, by the way. Never got the chance to watch Terminator: Salvation, so he was a relatively new actor to me), but I can easily say that Zoe Saldaña was the best one, which brings me to my next point, and what I think is the highlight of the film: the na'vi. If you thought Gollum in the LotR films or the prawns in District 9 were incredible in how much emotion and realism they conveyed, just you wait 'till you see this film's blue humanoids. They're, without a shadow of a doubt, the best-looking CG characters I've ever seen. Not only do they LOOK real, they FELT real, and after a few minutes in, one could easily forget they were all actors in motion-capture suits. The na'vi showed more emotion, more expression and simply just more life than what most live-action actors have today. I hope the Academy Awards consider motion-capture performances from hereon out in the Acting categories, because they were just outstanding in this movie, and WAY better than most live-action performances we get today. And the action, of course, was also fantastic. Cameron just proved to people like Michael Bay that the King is back. Not just the battle scenes, but even some parts that were just, say, some characters flying around on their banshees were just a beauty to look at, since all shots just show how amazing the incredibly deep and detailed world that Pandora is. To the senses, it's the most stunning film I've ever seen. As for story and dialogue writing, it could've been better, it's not perfect, but this movie's really about how the story is executed rather than the content. Another highlight for me is, of course, just how deep and detailed everything in this film was, and being an artist myself, you could easily imagine just what an assault on the senses it was for me to witness such a beautifully created world that is Pandora. Ranging from its flora to its fauna, all things in this world are indeed alien, but also have a familiar sense to them from our world. One who's been watching Cameron for the past few years would know that he's always been into deep underwater exploration, and you can easily tell that a lot of what he saw down there influenced his vision for many of the things we see in this lush beauty of an ever-stretching rainforest.As for the film's score, I really don't get why some people are getting upset about it. In my opinion, James Horner gave us a tremendous score that fit perfectly to whatever was happening during the film. And yes, I even like Leona Lewis' song in the end credits.Many filmmakers out there think about CG effects and put no depth into the narrative or story, but that's not the case with Cameron. In this film, the special effects MAKE the story. He puts special effects and story in a blender, and meshes these elements up so well that what we get is one of the most unique films in history. My score: 8.5/10, and I think I'd probably give it a 9.0/10 or higher if I had seen it in 3D, and definitely a perfect 10 if I had seen it in an Imax 3D screen with the best seat in the hall, but then, we wouldn't really be speaking in that case about a movie, and instead a full-on cinematic experience, which is what makes me think that Avatar will become a classic; it's more an experience than a film, it's a journey to a new world where our imaginations are tested, and has achieved perfectly what a movie is intended for in the first place, at least of this genre: pure, out-of- this-world escapism.]\n",

                                                                                                                                                                         [Avatar is the first movie I've watched in 3D. The hype is that it is made to be watched in 3D, and the 3D is not some afterthought tacked onto the movie like some other 3D movies. But being this is my first 3D experience, I'm unable compare Avatar's 3D to other movie's 3D, but from what I've seen, it gives a different experience, but not really essential. I have to admit that 3D does add something to the experience of watching the movie, but what it adds just isn't enough for it to be something that will change how people go watch a movie altogether.Apart from adding something, 3D also takes something away. If you're not used to wearing glasses, then wearing those 3D glasses while watching the movie isn't really \"comfortable\". You never really forget that you're wearing glasses. The feel of it on your face, and the glass itself gives you a feeling like you're watching a movie through a window. And wearing glasses also makes the movie darker than normal. Some dark scenes become just too dark to see what's happening.But the CG in Avatar really does push the boundaries of what has been done before. What they've really nailed is the facial expressions on virtual characters. That, they got it almost perfect. But as for the human/humanoid body movement, they've got most of it right, but some if it just isn't that good. But one GC element that they made \"their's\" bio-luminescence. Nobody has done it, and if they have it was never as good as what is seen here. The CG of mechanical things like vehicles isn't the best of what we've seen. Transformers 2 did a way better job of it than Avatar. And the vehicle and mech designs in the movie seems as if James Cameron is stuck in the 90s. They seem dated.In the end, what makes a movie isn't the CG, it's the story. And the story in Avatar isn't a very original story. It is about humans trying to exploit the riches of a foreign planet at the expense of the aliens living there. Sure James Cameron did a great job of fleshing out the environment of Pandora, the alien planet, but as to what takes place on the planet, he could've done better. The dialog is very simplistic, but it's not as Star Wars prequel bad. There's nothing \"edgy\" to the story. It's very straight forward ,feels like it's a story made for a kids movie. There isn't any plot twists that turn things upside down.So it has beautiful CG, but has a mediocre story. It still can be enjoyable if it has great action. But I'm sad to say that the action does not redeem the movie to enter the \"enjoyably fun\" category. The final battle is a big one, but I never really got into it. Maybe it's the 3D glasses, maybe it's just the direction, but it didn't work for me. What makes an action scene work is choreography and damage. As for the choreography, there isn't really much opportunity to implement cool choreography in the action scenes as most of the action is organism vs. machine. It's organism vs. orgasm is where choreography can shine. And as for damage, in their effort to keep the movie PG, there is very minimal blood splatter, and the vehicular damage wasn't very dramatic.So there it is. Avatar. A movie that wanted to change things, and change may very well come if enough studios jump on the bandwagon, but if seen as what it is, a movie, it's just mediocre., There are many opinions on Avatar. There are clearly believers, and fierce critics. The mere fact that so many people are talking about it, including myself, must mean that it struck a note with the masses. Any publicity is good publicity after all, no?Hmmm - Avatar. As many of you I had very high expectations, and to be perfectly honest, I was not disappointed. The execution is flawless and the visuals are stunning and mesmerising. The subtlety of the 3D makes it stand apart from the traditional Disney World 'jump in your face' sequences. There is however a small leap of faith to be made, and as pointed out correctly by many critics of the movie, the story is not really original. It has been told before, it is predictable, but then aren't all stories derived from an older version? There are only so many stories to tell and I can compare most 'original' movies to an obscure predecessor.If you let yourself be swept away by it, and ignore the 'intellectually superior' attitude that blocks you from seeing past the simplicity, you are in for a beautifully crafted love story, good vs. evil in its most basic form. Only this time it has a twist: the new technology allows you to be sucked into the story, but you have to be able to let go and enjoy the ride.If you would read the script of Star Wars before it was visually realised by George Lucas, you might have concluded the story was somewhat childish. And now this is heralded as one of the best movies of all times. It was visually spellbinding for its time, withstood the test of time, and all that with a simple and naive storyline we all came to love and cherish. What makes Avatar so different from this? Not much. The story is simple and stripped of all unnecessary character development to give the viewer an 'experience', 'an emotional feeling', and on that level, it is unsurpassed in beauty and sensitivity. It will have many teenagers look back with happy thoughts in their thirties of the time they saw Avatar on the big screen.Well done James Cameron for bringing us something old (that works) but presented in a way that is simply revolutionary. Kudos to you for writing the story yourself although it is not your forte. Lord of the Rings was the last time I was wowed, and a lot of that was the combination of story and groundbreaking visuals. But let's not forget that it was based on a great book, Star Wars nor Avatar are, which makes them - in my opinion - slightly more original. Did you ever wonder what LOTR would have looked like with Cameron at the helm?Finally, this movie is revolutionary and I starkly disagree with people who say it is not. Blaming the studios for substituting a good story with use of expensive technology and expensive special effects is a dated excuse. The technology is here to stay, and James Cameron has opened the road for many directors/screenwriters to take advantage of this technology as the studios are probably queing up now the business case has proved the investment to be a luctrative. Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg are already lined up for making movies using this very same technology - so to all people unhappy with the story - scripts with more depth are bound to come.Maybe not the greatest story, but one of the best cinematic experiences since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.I tell everyone: go see it without prejudice, and you might just LOVE it. I did ..., Like almost everyone else alive, I was looking forward to Avatar but I wasn't going on opening day or even opening week. I waited and lucky me, when I went to see it in IMAX 3D at 10am on a Saturday morning, there weren't even 30 people in the auditorium. Clean, comfy, and quiet. Just the way I like to see my movies that I pay for. Online ticketing was trying to charge me 15 bucks plus service fee. I paid at the box office because I knew it wasn't gonna sell out like it did the night before when I really wanted to go. 9 bucks was the tally. Can't beat that.Say what you wanna say and feel how you wanna feel about me for saying what I'm about to say, but I thought the movie totally sucked! That's right, I said it. This movie might as well have been a children's book it was so fluffy. Minimal cussing (even with the military present in this flick), no non-human nudity, straightforward plot with no twists or turns, ultra predictable, monotone and unmemorable characters, borderline unrealistic war motives, pointless deaths, uncreative and fairy tale climax, and the environmental theme was thrown in your face so much that you'd think you were watching a PBS special. Special effects aside (they were top-notch), there was nothing I liked about this movie. I very rarely laughed. I don't think I did at all. Only thing that got a chuckle from a few peeps was when the antagonist said he was part of the Jarhead Clan. That's about it. It was a practically emotionless movie-going experience.I mean, come on. You turn on your own species over a girl? She gives you a piece and that's all it takes? I can see about him wanting to become one of them because of the girl and having a functional body but is he really ready to live the natural life and abandon TV, internet, and all the other wonders of human technology? Yes, the tech is a demon and it can also be a godsend. I get it. But that morality was never discussed or explored. No civilized human alive would just switch that quick. I ain't buying it. Regardless of the cost for him to get new legs, I ain't buying it. Things could have been done differently. The world they created and the creatures within it were a little too forced for my taste. Took up too much screen time that could have been devoted to adding more complexity to an otherwise oversimplified plot. The whole deal was just too textbook. No depth at all.3D effects weren't so good. All the previews before the movie were of 3D movies, all of them kid movies. I expect more from 3D. I've gotten more from 3D. Those previews and the movie didn't deliver the goods. Depth perception is altered but nothing moves beyond the four corners of the screen or comes out at you. The IMAX screen was big with a crisp, clear picture and sound. I'll give credit where it's due. But save your money and if you have to see this movie, just watch it on a regular screen for a regular price. I would tell you to just wait for it on Blu-ray and if you have a nice sized TV, just watch it that way. To me, it's not worth a penny. It's boring and not at all entertaining. The only surprises were seeing Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi. Wasn't expecting to see those two. If this movie was Rated R and more authentic, then maybe it'd be worth a whirl. But as it is, if you have the mentality of a simple-minded and impressionable 10 year old, this movie is tailor-made for you. I give it 4 out of 10 stars. I don't care how popular it is or how much money it's made and is gonna make. For me, it sucks chicken bones. A complete and total waste of time and money. I'm disappointed more than anything. I expect better from James Cameron.Even with all that said, this movie still got a round of applause when it finished. Now it joins the ranks of Equilibrium, the Godzilla teaser trailer, Spirited Away, and the first live-action Transformers movie as the only movies I've been in attendance of that have gotten some applause. Nothing happens after the credits so don't waste your time even further like I did. And when I left the auditorium, there was a long line of people waiting to get in for the next showing. Wanted to tell them so bad that the movie is a dud but everyone has their own tastes. I would have been upset even more if I had to wait in a line like that to see such a horrible movie. It only got those 4 stars from me because of the innovative special effects and Zoe Saldana's voice acting. Everything else? FAIL!]\n",

Over the course of the next decade, Cameron created much of the technology he needed to make this movie possible. In 2002, Cameron watched The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and through the character of Gollum realized that his vision was finally possible. Twelve years have passed since the release of James Cameron's Titanic, will his new film prove that Cameron is still \"King of the World\"? Much has been made of Cameron's Avatar long before it's release. Hailed as a revolution in 3D and CGI technology, Avatar holds a lot of expectations, not the least of which is the fact that the budget and marketing for this film add up to approximately half a billion dollars, making it the most expensive movie ever made. Of course, Cameron has been here before. Titanic cost $200 million to make, the largest budget for a feature film at the time, and just when it looked like it was going to goose that laid the rotten egg it proceeded to make $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time. Cameron's also not new to the idea of revolutionizing the world of film with almost every movie he makes: with The Abyss he had the first all digital water effect, with Terminator 2 he had the first CGI character with realistic movement, and so on. Can lightning strike yet again? I'm generally someone who's adverse to using all caps for anything, but: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE!!!!! Also don't wait for it to come to DVD or to a TV station near you. Why, you ask? Because this movie is a movie that has to be seen the way it was intended to truly get the fully immersive experience. I watched the trailers on TV and online, and none of that compared to seeing the film in theaters in 3D. With Avatar, Cameron has truly outdone himself. When District 9 came out, I raved about the CGI effects in that movie, but Avatar is a whole other monster. With Avatar you truly cannot tell where the CGI begins and reality ends and vice versa, and on top of that it is the most beautiful film I've ever seen, CGI or otherwise. On top of that, Cameron's new 3D cameras create an experience that is in no way uncomfortable. No headaches and no motion sickness for those of you who suffer from that sort of thing. Instead, you get a highly immersive experience that leaves you begging for more (which is saying something, considering the film's run time is 162 minutes) and wanting to return when you leave.I've seen a lot of reviews lately that talk about the film having a weak script with too many clichés and one dimensional characters. What you really get, in my opinion though, is old school story telling with a message, even though the message is drowned out in special effects and action. The script moves quickly, there is no downtime, but you also never feel like the pacing is off, or that it's moving too fast. Cameron has built a complete world, we don't just see characters and action, but we see complete eco systems, and are introduced to many characters. While the entire cast is amazing, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch are the real standouts here. Sam Worthington creates a character that you feel for, and through his progress from pawn to leader is truly believable and heartfelt. Stephen Lang, on the other hand, gives us a character that starts off just trying to do his duty, but eventually becomes a character on par with Sergeant Barnes from Platoon or Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.I purposefully chose not to mention anything about the plot for this movie. I think this movie is going to be the revolution of movies that Cameron believes it's going to be. I've seen reviewers compare it to The Wizard of Oz (the movie to truly lead the color revolution) and King Kong (the 1933 version, which revolutionized special effects), and I wholeheartedly agree. I still can't completely fathom what I just saw, and will probably see it at least one more time on the big screen if not more. Anyone who's into film, the tech of film, or just wants to keep up with where film is going in the future should see this film. On top of that, this movie touches on so many different genres (SciFi, fantasy, romance, war films, drama, etc.) that it will appeal to almost everyone. Once again, James Cameron is \"King of the World\"! 5/5, I'm not sure where to begin with James Cameron's Avatar. I could start by saying I've been waiting 12 years for this film. I could start by saying Terminator 2 is my all time favorite movie, and I've watched it a thousand times since I was a kid. But I'm going to start with the most positive thing I could say. James Cameron is a special filmmaker. He revolutionized film-making in the 1980s with The Terminator and Aliens. He did it again in the 1990s with Terminator 2 and Titanic. So after 12 years of anticipation and hype, and all the reports of the record budget being somewhere between a mind-boggling $300 and $500 million, I expected Avatar to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.And sadly, it wasn't. Not even close. I will admit that the visuals in the film were stunning, and sometimes made you feel like you were dreaming. Cameron has definitely spent his time wisely creating a new universe all his own, and inventing a totally new world, one that leaves us in awe. However, for a filmmaker like Cameron, the whole IMAX 3D element of the film really wore on me. After a while, I couldn't wait to take off those uncomfortable glasses which helps us \"see\" the stunning visuals, as Cameron wants us to, which are quite nauseating, particularly for a movie that is almost three hours in length. I've never seen a film in 3D or IMAX before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But now that I've seen it, it begs the question, why? Hey Jimmy, you're James frickin' Cameron! You don't need 3D to make good movies, man! I feel like 3D is like cheating on a test that you've studied for your entire life. Why is Cameron trying to overcompensate for no reason? He can make superb films without any of this IMAX 3D CGI stuff.As for the plot, well there is none. Avatar essentially features no plot, or story, other than the typical love angle, which can only be classified as being beyond cheesy. If there is a \"story\", you've seen and heard it many times before. A man sent in to infiltrate a band of aliens grows close to their ways and in the end turns against his own kind when the two sides battle each other out. You've seen it in Dances With Wolves, you've seen it in The Last Samurai, hell, I could even go all the way back to 1956 and cite John Ford's The Searchers as a movie which features characters who are pulled into another society or world only to become one of them. Now, before you go and crucify me and say \"well every movie can be traced back to something else\", which is true, you need to understand that James Cameron is a trend-setter. HE is the one that makes the most refreshing movies, HE is the one that everyone else copies. HE doesn't need to copy anyone else. HE used to create films with creative plots and likable characters, but there's nobody to like in Avatar. After all, it's not easy to relate to a CGI-made 10 foot tall blue alien.I really expected more out of this film. The graphics were amazing, sometimes. Other times, it was just migraine-inducing. I wanted something to happen. And nothing really happened. Cameron could have made one of the all time great films if he had just put some more thought into it, and created a good story, with fleshed out characters, and a climax that doesn't come off as being a thoughtless, cookie-cutter finale. Armed with a budget of this enormity, and over a decade between narrative films, you'd think \"the king of the world\" would have come up with a better movie.But I do think people will love most of the visuals, I certainly did. But after nearly three hours, it suddenly dawns on you, \"is there anything else to this movie?\" Because while staring at the Mona Lisa is a very thought provoking thing to do, eventually, you move on! And that's what this film felt like. A beautiful painting come to life, but one that eventually gets tired and predictable. Sadly, and despite what most of people will say, because they loved the visuals and have never seen anything like it, James Cameron's Avatar was extremely disappointing and I'm not sure if I'll ever forget this kind of disappointment for a long, long time.I still love Terminator 2, and I still love James Cameron. But I feel like I've been waiting through a 12 year war for my loved one to return, only to see them come back a completely different person, one whom I simply don't know and can't trust anymore. Take this for what it is, an honest review from ONE viewer. Most will not be in favor of my thoughts, because it's not overly positive. But it is what it is. Avatar is not exactly a movie. It is something else. A $400 million cartoon perhaps. Or a $400 million live-action video game. It will probably be copied a million times over the course of the upcoming decade though. Maybe, hopefully, by the end of it, Cameron will return to making movies with real people again. Maybe then, everyone will copy him once more, and all movies will go back to being about real people again. I think that's something that we all want deep down inside, but, for some reason... we just won't admit it., James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. He is what you may call an Auteur. If you aren't aware of this, then you probably are not a movie person. James Cameron wrote and directed Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic. That last one I'm not a fan of, but he won Best Director, Picture, and it became the highest grossing film of all time. $1.2 billion dollars.Avatar is his latest film, it is a movie that has been in the works since 1994. After a decade of being in the works, you would expect it to be a good movie. But the real question is it any good? It is the most expensive film ever made. The budget was $500,000,000 so you'll be wondering if all that money was put to good use, and if you should spend $11.00 to see the film in 3-D. Should you or should you not?The answer is that you should. Avatar is a monumental success. It is a film unlike anything you have ever seen. It uses special effects to a level that you have never seen, and that's not a bad thing.The story to Avatar revolves around Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who is sent unwillingly to a hostile planet known as Pandora. While on this planet he finds himself caught in the middle of a war between the planet's indigenous people known as the Na'vi, and his own race. He must decide whether he should fight for what he knows is right or help his own people destroy Pandora as they destroyed earth. I don't want to spoil anything in the story, so I'll refrain from saying anything else. To put it simple, the whole movie was the prime example of a colonialism work.The cast in Avatar is strong. Sam Worthington (Terminator: Salvation) stars as Jake Sully. He does a fantastic job, but the real credit in the film has to go to Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) for playing the native Neytiri. She creates most of the emotion in the entire film. She preforms fantastically and I also have to mention that she is also really attractive as a blue woman. (True fact.) Some people have complained about Stephen Lang (Public Enemies) as the antagonist of the film. But he actually pulls off a very believable and cruel performance. All the actors in the film are great. But the real actors are the ones that are the digital Na'vi. These actors are the ones that create the film. I think that this movie is proof that special effects don't have to be of just robots killing and blowing stuff up. (Even though that's in this movie.) This movie shows that special effects can be used to take us to places that we never even dreamed of.Other films have used special effects like this. (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean, District 9) But none of them have gone as far as this movie has. This movie takes you to a whole new level of film making that you can't even imagine. You almost want to call this movie insane, because of how different and unique it is. You really have never seen anything like this, and that's a very good thing. What I really enjoyed about this film, was how it is a breath of fresh air. You don't see that very often. The only other films to do that this year for me were District 9 and Fantastic Mr. Fox. But Avatar is far more different and unique than these other movies.One thing that I always enjoy about a James Cameron film is his sense of innovation. Avatar is the most innovative movie I've seen in years. It is so different from anything else that you have seen. It is a movie a film that you literally cannot describe. This is a see to believe film. You'll have to see the movie to believe that it's as good as I'm telling you. Avatar is a once in a lifetime film. You will not get another chance to see a movie like this one.James Cameron creates not only a visually beautiful race of people, but also a culture that is so beautiful. The Na'vi in Avatar felt very Native American to me. Everything from how they dress to the musical score is very unique, and made me think of Native Americans. The film was almost like a reenactment of our history, with the Native Americans being driven out of their home land. It's all very believable. It's all very sad as well; and it moves you. I sympathize with the Na'vi as they fight for their lives and their home.I am not a fan of 3D. I think it is over used, and ultimately lessens the movie experience. Avatar however, is not like that. The 3D in Avatar is extraordinary. Little bugs on the screen fly right past you, leaves fall from trees towards you, and the battles are astronomical. You really feel like you're there, and forget that this is a movie. The cinematography is actually enhanced by the 3D which is a rare thing. The wide flying camera shots make you feel like you're flying with the film, it is fantastic.Avatar is a difficult movie to review because it is so innovative. It blows away almost all sci-fi epics out there, and is a must see. See Avatar. It is well worth full-price, and it is the best picture of the year. The only movie that comes to being as good as Avatar is District 9. Avatar however, I will say is better because Avatar has heart. A truly fantastic movie. Avatar is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, it is James Cameron's masterpiece, and it should not be missed.]\n",
            "3       2     55            2_the_to_of_and        [the, to, of, and, is, navi, in, avatar, his, jake]  [Do you remember the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? The day you watched Gollum interacting with Frodo and Sam in The Two Towers? Or even the day you first saw Star Wars? That sense of wonder, that sense of excitement, that emotional connection to something you witness on screen that was created in an effects warehouse and does not exist in the real world. That is how I hoped I would feel when I watched Avatar, James Cameron's first film since his mighty Titanic set sail back in 1997.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic marine sent to the distant planet Pandora to take part in a program where humans are being hardwired into the genetically grown bodies of the native population called the Na'vi. The mission is to become part of a clan, and learn more about the Na'vi people's culture. But not everything always goes to plan.Simply put, Avatar is an astonishing piece of film-making in all senses of the word. I had doubts that Cameron could top himself after breaking huge ground in the film-making medium with the likes of Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic, but those twelve years of documentary film-making and preparation (and maybe even helping create Aquaman) seems to have helped launch Avatar into the stratosphere. The film is difficult to describe, but it really is something to be marvelled at.The special effects that drive Avatar are some of the most advanced we have ever seen in a film. WETA has created a living, breathing world filled with a plethora of highly imaginative creatures, weapons and vehicles. Even the most sinister of beasts looks richly detailed, and awe-inspiring. There is just too much work that has been done on these creations that it is painful to even fathom how many hours it took to design everything that populates Pandora. Even the set designs and backgrounds, whether it be in the wild nature of the planet or in the militarized bases smack in the middle of it, are fully realized creations. There is no stone left unturned here, no half-assed effects in certain areas (which is more than can be said for the disgustingly effects-heavy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen); everything has the same amount of shine and polish added to it. The added gloss of 3D effects only help to further bring these effects to life, and seeing the film in a 2D setting would just be a disservice to the crew who put in all the effort to create them.When we reflect years from now on the film, the Na'vi people themselves are undoubtedly what we will continue to discuss. These giant, slim, blue skinned humanoid creatures are sensational creations. I wanted to believe at any given moment that they were real, because they looked and sounded that good. Better yet, Cameron managed to ensure they had their own language and their own culture as well. If they were not real, then the man has gone to great lengths to ensure they are the next best thing to it. There is so much going on at any time with them that I am speechless even attempting to decipher what to say next. If the film does not revolutionize film-making as people have said it in the months leading up to its release, these special effects wonders will.The acting is extraordinary across the board, whether it be someone acting as a human or as a Na'vi. Worthington continues from his film-stealing role in Terminator Salvation with another fantastic performance here. He is just so charismatic, so emotional and so real that even with his relative inexperience, he leads the film like no one else could. Zoe Saldana does a great job as Neytiri, Jake's connection within the Na'vi people, as does Michelle Rodriguez as the fighter pilot Trudy. Joel David Moore and Giovanni Ribisi also put in some great work in supporting roles. Although I was not expecting much from her, I was really impressed by Sigourney Weaver, who has a much more significant role in the film than the trailer may suggest. But the only one who even remotely comes close to the greatness of Worthington is Stephen Lang as the villainous Colonel Miles Quaritch. He gladly joins into a club of fantastically written and even better acted bad ass Cameron-film villains. At times, he is just downright terrifying to watch as he works his magic on screen.If there is anything wrong with the film besides its nearly obscene running time (which is not as bad as it could have been), it is that it plays out slightly predictable. It is not as by-the-numbers as movies like Clint Eastwood's Invictus is, but it does not take a lot of sharp turns after the plot makes itself known. If you know anything about it at all, you probably have a fair idea of what is coming once the film starts. I appreciate that the film does have a few surprises (and its share of hokey dialogue), but there were a few areas where I wish I did not already have a solid right guess as to what was coming next.Despite issues with the script, Avatar still manages to be the single most ambitiously conceived film-making project of the decade, and the rare film that is every bit worthy of its hype. It is the type of film where you need to look past its issues, and look at the worthwhile endeavour Cameron has helped give us for what it is – a truly unique science fiction that is unlike what we have ever seen before, and will not be easily recreated. The film practically begs to be seen to be believed.Welcome back Mr. Cameron. Hail to the king.8.5/10., James Cameron is a force of nature. His movies have an all-encompassing, ambient power of their own. The kind of power that makes a James Cameron movie a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar is his biggest yet. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a visionary masterwork of classic epic filmmaking and cutting-edge technology.Avatar's ambitious story follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) as he travels to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora's native humanoids, the Na'vi. The leader of the program, Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the greedy CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) look to exploit the Na'vi for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.Jake's inner conflict drives Avatar's story, and structurally, it works. Yes, it borrows a lot from Dances with Wolves. Learning from and becoming part of another culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. As a paraplegic, Sully's avatar allows him freedom. It gives him a genuine reason to view Na'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. I can buy it. And once the two sides of him finally clash, the power of that conflict really hits. It's a tangibly large story. Epic and engrossing. The effectiveness of that simple story, well told, of connecting with your supposed enemies is why I resent the disingenuous love story Cameron decided to put front and center.Before I get to the lavish praise of Avatar, which I consider one of the most special movie experiences of the century, I must address my one nagging grievance. The love story, the Neytiri character, and all the preachy \"bio-spiritual\" fluff that comes with her, irked me. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn't change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, and the CEO practices golf in his office. The point is, these are bold-faced archetypes. Neytiri is no different. She's a tree-hugging, flower-power philosopher. That's fine, but Zoe Saldana's performance has none of Stephen Lang's towering vitality or Weaver's cool confidence. It's all screeching and posturing. She's shrill and angry, and her spirituality quickly devolves into a full-on castigation of the evils of military conquest and deforestation. Shouldn't this spiritual guide be a little more even-keeled? I never believed that Jake would fall for her. Compared to Cameron's other movie romance, Titanic, Avatar seems manufactured. Neytiri is less a character than she is a face on which to pin the movie's heavy-handed message.With that out of the way, let's get to what makes Avatar the single most monumental cinematic achievement of this generation. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what's really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron's attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.So too are his technical innovations. The movie is remembered most for it's pioneering use of 3D, and rightfully so. Implemented alongside the uncanny photo-realism of the Na'vi's, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants, the 3D is more transporting than anything I have ever seen. All the superlatives in the world can't completely do justice to the Weta team that brought Cameron's gargantuan vision to reality, so I won't bother. The truly commendable aspect of Avatar is not that the special effects are so sophisticated, but that you forget that what you are watching are indeed special effects. Avatar uses 3D to immerse rather than amuse. You are absorbed in the world of Pandora so completely, that it cuts across the divide we have with most films. You don't watch Avatar, you live it, feel it, experience it.That feeling of absolute immersion is what defines Avatar. It's a movie, with plot, characters, and a story, but that stuff doesn't matter as much as the physical sensation it creates of actually being in a brand-new world. It's true, Jake Sully is less important than Pandora. But those who dismiss Avatar as simply \"pretty pictures\" are undervaluing the impact of James Cameron's image-making. Avatar creates visuals and utilizes technology so well, it makes the audience feel like part of the film. Some people take for granted just how significant that is. Others take for granted James Cameron's direction. Here is the single most ambitious movie ever conceived, and Cameron handles it all with the confidence of a world-class chef. This guy is not intimidated by anything. He is an elite director; the world's leader in action and world-building, and miraculously, he keeps getting better! Avatar is his most accomplished film.Avatar's success lies in its ability to engross every kind of moviegoer. Science fiction geeks and action aficionados can revel in some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), sentimental romantics can connect to the classic story, and even those who don't connect to either can experience the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of visiting Pandora. James Cameron has made a picture that defies comparison. There is not another movie that reverberates with the ethereal power of Avatar. Because Avatar is beyond movies. The film is overwhelming; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I've seen. Assisted by James Horner's majestic score and Mauro Fiore's epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. An original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. This is truly Cameron's magnum opus, a movie that burns with boundless passion. A classic that thrills as it inspires awe.93/100, Avatar is James Cameron's science fiction epic that has broken the mold for movie making. For years we have been hearing great things about the progress and set backs for this film. Since 1997, Cameron has yet to release a feature length film, excluding some of his work with IMAX and his documentary/3D films like Ghosts of the Abyss. 12 years after he broke all of the box office records with Titanic, the most successful film of all time, Cameron has come back with a bang. A big bang. Possibly the biggest bang in cinema history.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic Marine, is sent to a distant planet to follow up in his brothers footsteps. The planet is Pandora. A world filled with strange, magnificent fauna and flora. It's a world filled with vibrant colors, breathtaking landscapes, and a tribe of intelligent life called the Na'vi. Underneath their village lies a rich deposit of a very rare and profitable metal. In order to avoid a hostile takeover, the military has permitted Dr. Grave Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her Avatar program to try and persuade the locals through education, compromise, and good will that they are not to be feared. The program takes the DNA from the Navi and humans and combines them to create Avatars. These Avatars allow those whose DNA is in the Avatar to plug in andDr. Augustine's science department is at wits end with Colonel Miles Quatrich (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), the forces driving the drilling and military presence. They share one thing in common; an interest in Jake Sully. Sully and has his hands in both pots. He is the only person who can operate his brother's Avatar and he has an obligation to serve his military superiors. Sully is put in the difficult situation of making contact with the Na'vi and giving information to both Dr. Augustine and to Colonel Quatrich.I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot and the characters. That was the one part of the movie I wasn't too excited about at the onset of the film, but as the story played out, I became more and more involved and grew to accept and understand the story. It sounds and looks almost too ridiculous, but trust me, it works.I have seen a lot of science fiction movies. I have seen a lot of 3D movies. Never before have I seen a movie like this before. The clarity in the depth of vision Cameron creates is astounding. A friend of mine compared it to looking through a window, rather than the movie popping out of the screen towards you. I couldn't agree more. Needless to say, Cameron waited just the right amount of time to make this one.What make the visuals so outstanding is the attention to detail on each individual effect. Everything from the mountains and tree tops in the background all the way through the foreground is so clear and detailed. It's astounding! From the very first moments of the film when Sully is lying down and water droplets surround him, every scene has something to wow the audience.The cast has a wide variety of actors, the biggest of which is Weaver. I expected a solid performance from her but I was surprised by Worthington, whose only screen credit I had seen prior to this was Terminator: Salvation. Lang and Ribisi too give excellent performances. Even Michelle Rodriguez does a fine job. The actors that we can't see, like Zoe Saldana and Wes Studi, do a fine job as some of the the Na'vi leads.I felt a certain enjoyment that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was like watching Batman or Jurassic Park again for the first time. A kind of thrill that you experience on a roller coaster. There is so much to fall in love with here. I would have no problem saying that this is the best movie of the year. It's almost in a class of it's own. Avatar is the dawn of a new age in cinema. Where we are not bound by the constraints of technology. It's proof that if you can dream it, you can do it. James Cameron sought out to create a mesmerizing, groundbreaking film and he accomplished just that and more. The doubters who thought he would fall on his face are now the ones picking themselves off of the ground.The future looks bright for big budget movies. With this new technology and new way of story telling, audiences can expect more high quality entertainment. James Cameron goes all in with each movie he makes. His next movie is called Battle Angel, another futuristic tale about a female cyborg rescued by a scientist. Sounds crazy. I can't wait.]\n",

The storyline of the characters are predictable, I don't mind though. The CGI and 3D make up for anything else that you might want to 'whinge' or complain about.My son is 17 and unfortunately did not see this in 3D which affected his review. He said it was so-so on the storyline. He usually loves this kind of movie, so I was surprised. Meanwhile, he will be sent back to see it again with his big brother and change his review! The 3D version has gorgeous and believable depth, you'll see all plant life, creations & machinery you haven't seen in a movie before,too. All in sharp 3D. It's done in the way that it isn't cheesy and corny. (Remember Jaws & Friday 13 in 3D? ugh). The vegetation, animals & material things are jutting out suddenly or floating around subtly. You do feel like you are part of the movie, nicely done I think. After awhile, you are aware of the little pieces of this and that around in 3D and ooh and ah at it quietly, really. (We could hear ourselves and people around us, respectively doing this.No one was disruptive or acting like idiots in the audience, not one peep! I think everyone was humbled to experience this incredible CGI creativity. I was sad ;o) when it reverted back to human form throughout, I just wanted to see the CGI all the time! No Jar Jar Binks & Gollum in this movie. 100 times better than that, too.I love futuristic movies, this one is up there with the best. Yes the US marines are stereotyped in this movie, oh well, too bad. They serve a purpose. There are environmental, corporate, moral, ethical and tolerance messages throughout this movie.This is a keeper and I believe one of the best, visually stunning movies ever made. How James Cameron made his people steam train forward with his vision is incredible. I look forward to many more movies made like this one, not necessarily alien / futuristic. This will surely bring people back to the good old cinema.This should / must win all the awards for art direction, editing. I wonder how pain staking some of this was to make? I love Star Wars & Lord of the Rings, but this movie tops both of them for the breakthrough imagery on screen. So enjoyable. I think we will see it again maybe at the Sydney IMAX.Do not dare to cheap out and download this, people!!! You will not regret seeing it - on the bigger screen the better!! On another note, I can't believe our local little town cinema did not install the Dolby 3D equipment (they said would cost $200k). If not now, but also for the future of movies going forward. The lady at the cinema told me, \"oh, there are only a few scenes with 3D\" BullS@#&%!!!! We went in town and saw it in 3D, thankfully.So summarizing, ahh... $16 AUD well spent, I'd spend another.. will the eventual DVD come with those 3D glasses? I hope so!! Go see it before you are the last one and everyone has finished talking to death about it, will ya? Cheers to James Cameron. I give it a 300 million (cost to make it) thumbs up!!!, First I would like to state that this is my actual opinion. I am not putting in an extreme to try to balance off everybody else as seems so prevalent in these reviews. I put my money where my pen is so to speak. So first I will provide evidence that this is my actual opinion: My wife and I VERY seldom watch TV, but we do watch 3-4 movies/week. So although we do have a life outside of watching movies, we have literally watched thousands of movies. I have a sizable investment in home theater gear, so we do not feel compelled to go to the theater very often (a couple times a year). When we do, we are normally content to wait until the DVD is released to see the movie again (if ever). Prior to this, there was only one movie I had EVER seen more than once in the theater. That movie was Star Wars and although many of my contemporaries saw it 11 or more times, I was content to see it twice in the theater. Tomorrow, we are going to see this movie the third time in 3-D (I won't see it in 2-D because I can do that over and over again in my home when the DVD comes out.) and I am not ruling out seeing it yet again before it is pulled from the theaters. This shows a landmark change in my viewing patterns and I believe that I can be believed that I am rating it a 10 because I feel it is a landmark movie rather than trying to have an inordinate sway on the overall ratings.The movie was visually stunning, quick paced and quite a bit of fun to watch. It was a superb MOVIE.There are quite a bit of other reviews summarizing the plot and key points, so I will address some of the negative points.Many have said that the plot was very simple. While this is true, science fiction and fantasy have a hard time adapting to the screen if they have an overcomplicated plot. The reason is that much of the movie time is used to explain the framework. This could be technology or magic or whatever variables make up this fantastic world. The alternative is to have a movie that cannot stand on its own. \"Dune\" and \"Battlefield Earth\" were both excellent books with too much plot to make a good movie. Simple plots with well developed frameworks tend to make the best sci-fi/fantasy movies such as \"The Thirteenth Floor\", \"Soylent Green\" and \"Clockwork Orange\". Even \"Star Wars\" is very simple if evaluated only by its premiere movie. It is only after several movies that a more complicated fabric emerges. That is why stable \"Universes\" such as \"Star Trek\" are common. Once the framework has been developed, then relatively short stories can be more complicated since the framework doesn't have to be explained over again.There have been several objections to the use of \"unobtainium\" as a ludicrous name for a material. \"Unobtainium\" is not new to this movie. It is a common engineering/fictional concept that has been around at least since the 1950s (see the Wikipedia article). It even has its own symbol (Uo). It is funny. Get over it.There have also been several objections to the faculty that the aliens have with the English language. Excessive use of subtitles would detract from the movie far more than frequent usage of a non-existent language would.There have been objections that the movie is predictable. OK, it isn't a who-done-it, and being unpredictable is not required for a show to be good. I absolutely love the BBC \"The Blue Planet\" series, and all of the fish behave exactly the way I would expect them to.My advice is if you want cerebral sci-fi/fantasy with exotic locations and complex plot lines, read a book. If you want a wonderful trip into an exotic land watch this movie. I think it is beyond compare and the box office seems to indicate that I am not alone., Visuals: For years Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and all sorts of other sci-fi or fantasy movies have been trying to take us to another world. This one succeeded, and it was so beautiful. I swear that I had a religious experience in reaction to the visuals to this movie, probably akin to the feeling that many people had when they watched the original Star Wars for the first time in theaters. I don't tend to get teary eyed over physical beauty that often, but this world moved me to tears from the sheer beauty of it. It was like stepping inside an expressionistic painting. If you get a chance to see this in 3D, do it! If you get a chance to see it in the theater, do it! If you miss out on all that and watch your DVD in an old tube television, well... still watch it, although you might not have quite the same reaction as everyone else. The visuals get an A, and I somehow feel that an A isn't high enough to do this movie justice.Sound: If the sound had failed, then the visuals would have too. Pandora sounded alive and organic. The creatures made sounds that matched the visuals and the music superbly added to the drama of what was going on. A Acting: I tip my hat to every actor in this movie. The humans interacted with the CG characters in such an organic way that I really never questioned the fact that the humans were reacting to no one. Sam Worthington, mixing this with his roles in Terminator 4 and Clash of the Titans, may be establishing himself to be the next big action star since Jason Statham. Likewise, Zoe Saldana's career is on the rise as she just came off playing Uhura in the Star Trek reboot. And then there's Stephen Lang... good Lord, I do not want him angry with me under any circumstances ever. The man was ripped in this movie and looked like he could give Chuck Norris a run for his money. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a movie with Stephen Lang portraying a character very similar to his role as Col. Miles Quaritch, but as the movie's main protagonist instead of villain. The acting department gets an A! Story: Normally, I tackle story first thing in my reviews. I saved it for last here, because I really loved this movie, but that doesn't mean that I'm blind to some issues with the storyline.My initial review was too long for IMDb, to read my full review visit tacmovies.blogspot.comAnyhow, this is the archetypal mole goes native story. There are some shocking similarities between it and the novel Call Me Joe, and it wouldn't be the first time that Cameron had been sued for plagiarism, as Harlan Ellison sued him over Terminator, but I still think that simultaneous creation is possible in this instance. Regardless, the story is pretty good, but it's definitely the weakest link in the chain. All of the characters played their parts in making this story function, but I definitely thought some parts were written a bit shallow, for instance (SPOILER WARNING): 1. The Na'vi never once thought that Jake was giving intel to the humans? I think tvtropes.com might call this \"Plot Induced Stupidity,\" especially when you consider that they only let him stay there to gain intel on the humans. Slightly hypocritical, if you ask me. Since we're on the subject, Neytin turned on Jake and immediately never wanted to see him again before the humans attacked and her father died. This despite the fact that the Na'vi mate for life and the two just mated. After taming a red dragon-like creature, she welcomes him back with open arms.Okay, this functionally works to progress the story, but I think a better progression would have been to have the two mate, Jake reveals his mole status and the rest of the Na'vi turn on Jake but Neytin, feeling that strong, irrational mating bond, stands by her man until her father dies, at which point she turns on him. Jake then tames a red dragon and symbolically regains the trust of the Na'vi but it takes a little longer for Neytin to forgive him. At least, that's how I would have done it.2. The evil human corporation is willing to massacre innocent natives to make a quick buck. It's so one dimensional that it's painful. Not to say that it couldn't happen, but I wanted more, and I think the movie hinted at more. In fact, Worthington's character mentioned that the earth had been ruined somehow. If we as a race no longer had a home world and were dependent upon Unobtainium to survive, and the Na'vi were unwilling to negotiate giving us any Unobtainium for over six years (which the movie stated was the timetable the negotiations had gone), then I think stealing it wouldn't necessarily have been the right thing to do morally, but necessary for the survival of the human race. The story hints that this is what's going on behind the scenes, but never says it outright probably because we the audience would turn on Jake Sully if we knew that. In any case, I would have preferred that the storyline be less cut and dry. The soldiers just started shooting. They didn't try a covert mission to steal the Unobtainium first, and the money grubbing corporation didn't recognize the potential money to be made in harvesting the forest's telepathy/soul bank? Again, I thought the writing was okay, but with some major problems. C Overall: You should see this movie. It's awesome. Yes, the writing is a bit shallow at times, but it's still really good in spite of the writing. A]\n",

Best experience of my life. It isn't just a movie you really feel like you have entered an entire new and better world. Maybe the best movie I have ever seen and God I have seen a lot. Definitely the best visual effects ever!!!! A little bit of crumby dialog but other than that the whole thing is a TEN. This movie has everything great acting, story, action, and effects. You must see this movie in theaters preferably in IMAX. The creation of the Na'vi is amazing above all the other things. I wish I were one of them. And an amazing love story also completes the film so everyone who goes will be satisfied. Yes, the story is one that we have heard before and is really nothing new but, it is a story we love and is told in a whole new way. Avatar is doing right now what Star Wars did for its time. This is an epic. If you would like to talk to me about my review send me an email at uwanttoknome@aim.com, My review is going to be short and sweet. I got out of the theatre 30 minutes ago and Im still in a stupor about the movie I have just seen.This movie connects with the audience in a way that no other movie has. Near the middle and end of the movie I felt an emotional connection with the characters. That has NEVER happened to me with any movie I have ever seen. All I can say about this movie is that it is a must see and a must have. I know that as soon as it is released I will be buying a copy and watching it a couple times over.I know that my review was short but I hope it gets a couple more people to see the movie because it is worth the money., The only reason I gave this movie a 10 is that IMDb hasn't implemented 15's as a score yet. It is simply incredible.There are a few naysayers who have complained about the plot of the movie. My only explanation is that they are just too stupid to appreciate what they just saw. The plot has everything you could ask for, and is very different from anything you've ever seen in a major motion picture. This movie could play without the soundtrack and the story would still be compelling.However, the home run hit by this movie is unquestionably the special effects. Again, maybe some kids that have grown up in the 'great special effects generation' aren't able to to really watch what is going on and truly appreciate the achievement. In the car driving home, I commented that I was surprised I was actually getting us home ... the entire time images from the movie were still racing thru my head. This movie is just truly a feast in every way. From the opening shot to the last the visuals are the most incredible I've ever seen in any media. To hearken back to the famous \"Superman\" advertising ... You WILL believe a 10 foot alien man can fly on a wyvern-like alien beast!\"It all looks real, from the stunning alien world to the action scenes to the acting on the faces of the aliens.Don't try to analyze this movie. Just go to see it, sit back, relax (when you can), and be amazed at this stunning achievement!I highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D. Once it is out of the theaters, it may be a long time before you will see anything like this again, and you will NEVER again see this movie like the experience you will have in the theater. Many movies are as good (or better) at home on Blu-ray. That will not be the case with this film.]\n",

had a lot of potential to be amazing. It is still very good, but many argue against it since it ripped off Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves. Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don't complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue and plot points are terrible, but shut your brain off and it's a fun experience.Let's look at the world of Avatar. It's a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.Disregarding the elaborate world-building involved in this film, the movie is filled with clichés, cheesy dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. Let's look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na'vi since they're \"savages\" (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver's character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn't consult many co-writers.What this movie lacks for in quality of writing, however, it makes up with heart. The ideals the Na'vi strive for seem like they have been forgotten in the real world today, and they are what draw us and Sully to them as a community. We cheer for Sully and the Na'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?Avatar is good; it cannot be labeled terrible simply because it takes plot points from Dances With Wolves, but it does lack quality based on its disregard for good dialogue and some underdeveloped characters.3.0/4.0, \"Avatar\" is billed as an action, adventure and fantasy film. While it is all of these, it's basic plot and makeup is all science fiction. There's no doubt about the fantastic technical and production qualities of this film. It's a joy just to watch the colorful scenes, sets and creatures of Pandora. CGI clearly has gone to the next level in creating backdrops, sets and scenes for use with live action filming. This is very good fantasy stuff. With so many reviews already, I won't rehash what others have said. But, I didn't see reference in the comments I scanned to a couple of things worth noting. So, this is to add them to the discussion of this film. A number of others are critical of the film for its lack of originality. It's true that the same themes of the genre of sci-fi and space exploration have been used a great deal before. The earth has depleted its resources and must find new ones somewhere else. The indigenous creatures of Pandora have their own deity. So, this film has considerable mythology. The new type of bionic man comes into this one with a scientific melding of human and something else. The humans are aliens to this planet or moon, and there is the usual division of some who care about the natives and others who couldn't care less about them. Much less often, fantasy and sci-fi films will use a writing trait found in classical literature. That is symbolic names and other words. Two leap out in this film. The first is the moon's name, Pandora. From Greek mythology, Pandora's box (or jar) today refers to a plethora of things that can cause havoc or problems. That fits this movie all too well. The second obvious symbolic word is the name for the rare mineral that earth needs, \"unobtanium.\" So, it can't be obtained on earth or elsewhere.What is a somewhat unique about \"Avatar\" is that it combines all of the above aspects of sci-fi and more. But with so much action and all of the visual spectacles, it makes a plot that is very difficult to follow. When I came out of the theater after seeing this film the first time, I thought about the splendid visual show it was, but also wondered if there was any real point in the plot. It seemed to be just a complex story made to pull together many scenes of action, visual treats, and wild fantasy and sci-fi things. Watching it again, the visual spectacle is still there, and the plot fades. So, this isn't a film that would be recognized for the original and main crafts of theater - acting and directing. A good analogy might be with what Americans enjoy every year in celebrating the Fourth of July. Whoever tires of watching spectacular fireworks displays? We don't think about the theme, or the reason or the history at that moment. And, year after year we turn out to watch the fireworks again. \"Avatar\" isn't so much a movie or film with a great story and actors performing in it. It's just a spectacular fireworks display on the silver screen., Avatar gets a 10 because of its visuals and some of the natural soul satisfying themes therein. The rest of the film does not matter; I'll explain why.The plot is as standard and as conventional as they come. The whole film is a collective of clichés and things we have all seen before on screen. A Marine without the use of his legs becomes part of a program on Pandora. Selected individuals become the 'avatars' that have been specifically engineered for them and go out into the alien world of Pandora. The objective: to study the natives, indigenous 'beasts,' life forms and layout of terrain in the interests of military tactical advantage. The Marine is given the incentive of government-approved working legs if he is successful in completing the objective. Marine, assisted by ever so cheesy, clichéd, cartoonish two-dimensional characters enters world, meets girl, meets tribe, learns ways, gets accepted, falls in love, and ultimately decides in all predictability that Pandora is more valuable to him than the 'real' world. That's about ten or so films that we can all list covered so far. And so 'jarhead' ultimately becomes protagonist, protector and defender when the 'good' guys who are fighting the 'savages' decide it's time to eradicate and show them just who is boss. Don't you love the mentality :) So, back to the reason of sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses. It takes a little while, but the reason for every Effects house, department, and agency working on a 400-million dollar film becomes oh so very apparent. So I am a gamer, very much accustomed to playing pretty games on high-end tech. I am also a film geek, details, details, details. So, you will understand that when the lights go down a little and I'm looking at 'other worldly' vegetation full of sap or rain water, and I sit there shaking my head because my brain can't seem to compute that specially created/generated foliage defies that very concept. When the lights go down on Pandora I might as well be looking out of my own window. Indeed, I was also dubious when I heard a similar statement. Avatar, when you get past - but can't really get past - because you are looking at animation that looks so real that you can instantly (pretty much) tell who the actor is behind the 'mask' - the phenomenal visuals. You are allowed to smile, and perhaps to have your eyes well up a little, with Jake's first encounter as a 'Dragon' rider. Here perhaps is a nod to Anne McCaffrey's 'Pern.' The rider chooses the Dragon and the Dragon the rider. When the bond is made, they become one. I want to get back to the characters again. Remember when I said details, details, details: The skin, the eyes, the flakes of dust that land on the skin after an explosion, the ears that move and stretch. the physical motions and motor skills. What is the expression I am looking for.. 'more human than human'. OK, time to close. The weakest link, in my opinion, and I truly hate to say this out of my respect for one of the mothers of sci-fi, is Sigourney Weaver's character. Rather than playing a secure, natural maternal scientist we have a re-hashed Ripley after 23 years, only it only serves to weaken the experience. As soon as Sigourney opens her mouth, I want her to close it. It's not big, it's not clever; and I don't care if it's a military 'thing' in a PG-13 film. The mild swearing is out of place. Some of the audience cheered and clapped when Michelle (signature frown and growl) Rodriguez says: \"You're not the only one with a gun, bitch!\" Why do women need to grow balls in these flicks.. You don't need to compete with the alpha male who is doing a fine job of cheapening the human race. It sounds great coming from Sigourney Weaver, in full control of a robot walker facing off against mother Alien, but it's not 'Aliens', it's Rodriguez with a pair who should stay in films that go straight to video shelf. I perceive that there is a reason behind the far too obviously staged overacting. It contrasts with the wonderful soothing, soul enriching acting from the Naa'ri. It also serves to exploit the human race for what they are: Takers, antagonists, butchers, and barbarians. Avatar is the current apotheosis of the reason we enjoy cinema. Anyone who is anyone can enjoy it, though preferably not younger children. Kids and adults alike who don't understand (or care about) the plot can get lost in the amazing world of Pandora.Highly recommended, not something that should be missed on the biggest, most technically capable theater you can find. Can't be described, needs to be seen to be believed.]\n",

to it a lot but I must admit when I saw the trailer it didn't really do it for me. It wasn't what I thought it would look like. But as I like every other James Cameron film I thought I would check it out and I must say it is spectacular. I didn't think I would like but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.The visual effects are just amazing. There is no other word to describe it. Pandora actually felt like it was real. It was that good. The attention to detail was brilliant. It just looked so realistic, visually stunning. The scene where Jake learns how to fly looked amazing. The dragon like creatures looked very real and were very well designed. I loved it when Jake and Neytiri were racing down the side of the mountain. The camera angle they got on that was brilliant.The last 30 minutes of the film was just breathtaking. I mean it was all systems go. It was non stop action the whole way. James done a great job of putting that together. It was just so well done. They had some great moments when it went slow motion. That was brilliant. It was just so mad with all helicopters and the navi in the air taking each other out.Colonel Miles who was played by Stephen Lang was the best character for me. He played him so well that he really made you hate him because he was just so brutal. He just didn't really care about anyone. He just pretty much wanted everyone dead. The look of his character was spot on, making him big and mean and having those scars across his face.Also the navi looked really good. I mean loads of people were saying they looked rubbish in the trailer but on the big screen they looked amazing. It was just amazing how they got the facial expression looking so good. I mean when Jake jumped in the lake when he was being chased it looked so real when the water was dripping from his face.James Cameron can definitely be happy with this film. He just never disappoints. Some of his camera angles were brilliant. They were just so clever. I mean the end battle must have taken him ages to film, let alone edit. This film is definitely one was best films I have ever seen and gets me really excited to see what the film industry could be like in a few years to come with technology like this. It is so entertaining and will have you glued to the screen throughout the whole film and wanting to see what Cameron can come up with next. I can't wait to see what the sequel will be like., I've seen this movie twice now; both times in 3D.The visuals are spectacular without a doubt. James Cameron has always been on the leading edge of breaking new ground in special effects. You are really immersed in the world of Pandora.The plot though leaves something to be desired. Basically, you have the hero with a tragic past who goes on a mission for the bad guys. He meets up with the locals and realizes that he was working for the bad guys and changes sides and all the clichéd characters are there from the evil gung-ho Marine colonel to the jealous but noble native warrior.If you've seen Dances with Wolves or Last Samurai, or The Mission or any of a dozen of movies with a plot line like that, then you've seen this and you know exactly what is going to happen.Then we come to the plot holes.1. It took the ship 5 years to get to Pandora. Sully's brother had trained for 3 years prior to this for the \"mission.\" So they had a mission almost 10 years in the making? The situation on the ground in Pandora wouldn't have changed in that 10 years? Really? I mean it looked like the operation on Pandora was relatively new...I'm pretty sure the evil corporation would have gone ahead and knocked down the tree long before Sully got to the planet. 8 years is a long time.2. Unobtainium....really? That was the best James Cameron could come up with? So it's a rare material but what does it do? Surely, Cameron could have come up with something better than that.3. If arrows couldn't penetrate the cockpit windshields in the scene where they destroy the hometree, then how could they do so in the final battle? 4. Speaking of the military equipment...wow, pretty flimsy. The heavy machineguns are obviously just M-60's with a few pieces of metal (or rubber) slapped on the sides. But the transports were pretty vulnerable to...just about everything. In 150 years, that's the best we've come up with? The mech-warrior things were cool but again...pretty vulnerable. I have to wonder if this was the part of the movie that James Cameron came up with 15 years ago and just didn't notice that the trend is unmanned.5. If the vortex cause all sorts of complications with the instruments in the transports...why were communications unaffected and why wasn't the Avatar program disrupted in there as well? 6. So the master plan to defeat the Navi was to fly a slow-moving transport aircraft as a makeshift bomber to bomb the tree? They couldn't bomb the place from orbit? And before someone jumps on me for the gravitational flux or whatever...no. They were able to get orbital imagery so they could have easily just fired some cruise missiles or whatever the future evil corporation has and carpet bombed that whole region. The first rule of combat is to kill your enemy from as far away as possible and a former (or current) Marine Recon Lt Col would know that.8. As for the end battle...what was the ground assault for? The main effort was to bomb the tree into oblivion, right? So...why send in your ground troops who were already outnumbered? Why not just send in your fast attack ships to just fire incendiary rockets at the tree and call it a day? 7. The Avatar Navi bodies were genetically engineered to reach full maturity in a short amount of time...you gotta think that such engineering would also cause a short lifespan for such a creature. After all, Sully and his brother before him were supposed to be on a 6 year mission so why create something to last longer? Not a big point but it'd be interesting to see in Avatar 2 that Jake Sully's avatar begins a rapid decline in health, haha.8. So the evil corporation just left before they got punched in the nose? Yeah, they wouldn't just come back with more firepower or anything and just blast like a 1,000 square kilometer area into smoldering ruin from where they would build a new base.I suppose the message Cameron is sending is \"hey, don't pay attention to the flimsy plot line, look how beautiful this world is that I created!\" The other messages were just lame. Hey James Cameron, Bush isn't in office any more and hopefully you weren't saying that Saddam Hussein was like the Navi...because yeah, you can bet that Hussein would have been 10 times as worse as the evil mercenaries were.And the irony of this film which cost upwards of 400 million to make and took the cutting edge of technology and probably had quite a carbon footprint...yet technology is evil and we should all go back to nature where there will be complete harmony......yeah....., I've seen this film twice in 3D and was completely blown away each time. Hands down the best movie of 2009! It totally lived up to its hype and deserves all the credits and praises it's received.Surely it's not the most original story in movie history (then again what really is original these days?), but it's still a good story and it's very well-told and beautifully executed. The movie is also very easy to follow and easy to get absorbed into. If you like most people who have seen this movie, you'll be automatically lost yourself in the world of Pandora after 10 minutes into it without even realizing it. The CGI is the most realistic and beautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. The details are just so exquisite and breath-taking. It's hard to believe all the creatures and sceneries on Pandora was digitally created! It totally put films like Transformer 2 or 2012 to shame in the CGI department, not to mention the former had a much better story than the latter two. I was so in awe the whole time with how lush and beautiful this movie looks that I kept thinking about the movie long after it ended. And the CGI characters they created for this film were very natural and realistic-looking! They may not be 100% photo-realistic but they're close enough. The \"Uncanny Valley\" is nowhere to be found on the Avatars or the Na'vi. You totally believe them as real characters with real emotions and souls, and you forget that they are computer generated after a certain point in the movie. In fact, I found myself related to those CGI characters much more than the real humans. James Cameron really get it right this time! The movie's visuals (as well as the 3D) are stunning without seeming gimmicky. The story, despite being slightly predictable (which happens to most great epic films), is fast-paced and engaging throughout the movie. The theme is inspiring and thought-provoking without seeming forced and preachy. I can go on and on. There's just so many to talk about! Seeing this movie just once wouldn't be enough. I've seen it twice and I still want to see it again and I definitely will. It's weired but that's just what this movie does to you (or at least to me).To those who haven't seen this movie: Don't judge on the advertisements, previews or internet clips, none of which did the movie justice AT ALL. This is the one film you have to see and experience for yourself. And don't let the hype affect your desire of seeing this movie either. The movie is hyped for a reason, and a good one. So what are you still waiting for? Get out of your friggin' house and go see this movie already! And you'd better see it in 3D, either in IMAX or regular theaters. To truly appreciate the beauty and the awesomeness of this movie, a 3D viewing is a must!]\n",

                                                                                                  [So, I'm a big sci-fi and action type of guy with epic exposition in mind. So why did I not take a shining to this film that had all those elements and more? Why did I not warm up to it? What was it that was missing from this piece?It's kind of the same reason I didn't go see \"ID4\", and why I thought that concept of a film was pretty bad in the first place. It had no soul.So it is with Bruce Cameron's \"Avatar\", a play on the realm of computer games and online interaction, which tells the tale of a man who is likewise relegated to forever living vicariously through his blue skinned alternate persona. A comment on today's youth if I ever saw and heard one before in my life.\"Avatar\" hits all the right dramatic cues. It hits all the right emotional chords for drama, plot, character, story, and even has dazzling visuals to accompany the tale of a world fraught with noble savages warring with a corporate army.I found myself laughing, loving, and even shedding tear or two as I watched this film in a packed movie theatre. And with all of the explosive action, with all of the romance and traditional underdog fighting hightech warrior themes going on, what was it that this film lacked?For all of the pro-native and pro-life messages going on here, I just found the thing to be fairly plain and unintelligent. The message of the film is sent via a telegram. It's written in big letters and nearly shoved down the throat of the audience with a huge silver spoon. Couple that with the \"muster your inner soul\" thing, and I had a hard time connecting with this film on a basic level.Oh sure, I got all the emotional stuff, and agreed with the moments of drama, but it simply was a film made for a five year old teenager. In short, it was unintelligent. When I think of classic sci-fi that I watched ages ago, I think of films that were made for adults even though they were veiled in high gloss that attracted younger viewers. That, and they had a set of precepts of what was right, and what was wrong. It wasn't a clinical analysis and twisting of basic and fundamental American values, and breakage thereof.But \"Avatar\" is made for the young \"international\" youth audience. It's designed to be a universal message attempting to appeal to everyone and everything. It's like a politician who promises a chicken in every pot, who kisses babies, shakes hands and the like, but winds up being powerless because he's promised too much to everyone, and has lost his own sense of worth. That sounds very existential, but it's essentially the problem with \"Avatar\". And it's essentially part of the reason it is not thriving like the other established sci-fi franchises out on the market. \"Avatar's\" message is that your primal instinct to mate should outweigh your other responsibilities, and that those other values that are wrapped in a colored cloth are mere jingoism and are merely clouding your judgment. The nail in the message's coffin is the corporate army is just that, a business venture run for mass murder, and for the sake of controlling and educating the natives. It's a trite message for a film that demonstrates equal regard for its target audience. And as for the 3D adding to the film? I saw the same technology demonstrated at Disneyland 25 years before with Captain EO. I can't say much has improved.Watch at your own risk., I was looking forward to Avatar. I saw it on the second day it played and paid the extra money for the 3D. I enjoyed it, but it's far from the benchmark film some have been claiming.First the motion-capture technology is fine when used to replicate body motion, but not facial expressions. It can duplicate basic broad facial movements, such as anger or laughter, but anything subtle is simply not there. You still relate to the alien characters as being animated and the earth characters as being real actors. We're obviously expected to not be aware of any difference between animated characters and real actors, but there is a substantial difference. There is also a huge lack of original ideas for both technology and the creatures inhabiting the planet. Star Wars, Alien, 2001 A Space Odyssey or even going back to Fantastic Planet, gave the public technology and environments which had never been seen on the movie screen before. It's not that these films were absolutely original as they did borrow ideas. But when they did borrow, for the most part, they were not from other films and so it was new to the general public. Avatar just borrows too heavily from other movies we've all seen. For heaven's sake, did the bad guy REALLY have to get into one of those giant robotic suits for the climactic battle? Technologically, there is nothing in here that compares to the first time the public saw the space station wheel in 2001, or the H.R. Giger sets of Alien, or the giant planet walkers in Star Wars. Then there are the animals which inhabit the planet which look far too similar to earth animals. Basically, the alien tigers look like tigers and even the dinosaur-like creatures, well, look like dinosaurs! And the action scenes, somehow didn't generate the excitement they should have. For example, when they were flying on the backs of the giant bird-creatures, I never felt the particularly thrilled by it. A flying scene like that should have made you feel a sensation of vertigo. I was thinking that it might have been because the jungle environment was so strange and foreign that you had no sense of height the way you would in a city scene when buildings give your mind something to relate to. But I think there may have been a bigger reason. Greater importance was given to hammering home the message of the film, rather than simply being caught up in the action. So, flying on the backs of the birds was to show \"the majesty of the natural world\" instead of just the thrill of it. And the battle scenes were not the battle scenes in a Star Wars film, because it simply more important to feel the sorrow and horror of war. Compare the actions scenes in Avatar to Dark Knight and there is no comparison. The only place Avatar excels is in the depth and detail of the planet. The jungle is probably the star of the movie. However, I could just go to an Imax showing of the real Amazon jungle and get the same experience.If you keep your expectations reasonable, you'll probably enjoy Avatar. But this isn't the new Star Wars., Strangely enough, I think, at least from one angle, the movie most similar to this one is American Beauty. Both movies were loved when they were released and hailed as some of the greatest achievements in all of cinema. But as the years passed, the backlash set in ans soon enough, you couldn't throw a stone without hitting someone who didn't like these movies.Not that this isn't also true for a lot of other movies, including Titanic, Little Miss Sunshine, and, more recently, Frozen, all of which are on this list. But all those movies still have sizable fandoms.Not so for American Beauty, a movie you have to look around to find fans of. And certainly not so for Avatar, a movie in which you have to practically be Indiana Jones to find fans of, at least on the internet. For all the technological innovations it brought upon the industry, it is a movie that not a lot of people seem to like. Basically, it is the answer to the question, \"What would LOTR's impact have been on the world if it had been disliked?\" When you say that you like this movie, the first thing that a lot of people say is that, \"But...don't you see that it's just Fern Gully (a movie that I first learned about by these comparisons), Pocahontas (Eh), and Dances With Wolves (a movie I like better than you and did not find that boring even though I watched the four-hour long version). It's not original.\" (Malice is not intended, but feel free to read that in the most whiny voice possible.) Yes, it is like those movies. You fools might think that you're the explorer of your generation by realizing that. But let me break it to you: your beloved Star Wars/LOTR/Indiana Jones/ Whatever is a lot like a number of movies too.As I said in the ESB Review, there are few big budget adventure movies that are quite like other movies from decades back and books from centuries back and plays from millennia back. There are a certain amount of stories and elements that just stick close to peoples' hearts. And so those are repeated again and again. Not that this is a bad thing. I adore LOTR and many other movies that follow this formula. If you want to hate Avatar, fine, I don't care. It's not even my favorite thing with 'Avatar' in its name. But hate it for reasons that are more fully fleshed out than \"It ripped off X and Y.\" By the way, after you read this review, I highly recommend reading Joseph Campbell's' Monomyth if you haven't already. It's the definitive work on what I've just described.So now that I've thrown darts at some of the reasons why people hate this movie... I suppose that I should now say why I like it. Here we go. It's not the main character, who is as forgettable as any. The rest of the actors are good and are able to elevate a middling script (people don't watch Cameron movies for the writing, though in this, as in his other movies, it's fine) but they are not great. The top honors go to Zoe Saldana, who takes a rather flat role and infuses it with humor and wit and some majesty.The music is enough to carry the film at parts. James Horner (who died just this year; RIP) puts together one of his most masterful scores. That statement is impressive considering that this a man who scored more great movies than many people have even watched and who composed the Titanic soundtrack, which sold more copies than any other mostly orchestral soundtrack in history. It feels tribal and majestic yet lively and energetic, and is a good fit for the film as well as a good listen on its own right.But that's not why I love the movie. I love it because of its world. Some would say that you have to separate the technical accomplishments from those of the film. But as an 'atmosphere and tone' guy, I say that's impossible. That would be like asking someone to go to Costa Rica but only to do activities, not to check out the scenery.Simply preposterous. And the film is impressive sight. I do believe that I've never seen a live-action film that managed to wow me as much as this one did. Anyone who doesn't think this film looks good doesn't believe that the best CGI is not only supposed to mimic reality, but to fundamentally enhance it. I do. This is also why I love the Hobbit movies more than you, though they are not on this list.Not including this film on this list would be like not including the moon landing on a list of the top 100 moments in the twentieth history. It was such a step forward that to ignore it would be leaving a gaping hole in your layout. And so, while I go back to party under Hometree with the Na'vi and give props to whoever made its language, I will end with two final thoughts.One: this film should have won in the Oscars over The Hurt Locker. That still hurts, even now.Two: thank you, haters, for moving onto this film and off one my ten favorite films of all time, Titanic. Just sayin'.]\n",

                                                                                                                   [i went to see this movie with high expectations. i must say this movie really did not fail to succeed. it took my breath away. the movie is just that amazing. certainly the first time. the movie is just so beautiful created and brought to you. i have yet to see the 3d version of it, but i hope it will be even more amazing then the 2d version. the plot isn't original, looks a lot like pocahontas. but just because the plot isn't original, doesn't mean it is bad, like a lot people say.imagine the pocahontas movie, but now twice as long, 20 times as beautiful and its realistic. but because this is realistic u don't have the messed up animals that can be funny.this movie was made to get the people back to the cinemas, and it did not fail.now, to all the people that gave this movie a 1 or 2. HOW?! if u didn't like the plot or script, fine. but i cant imagine that this movie earns a 1 or 2. i mean this movie LOOKS so beautiful. the way it is made and gets shown to the public. if u rate a movie a 1 or 2, that means the movie was UBER bad, like, everything about the movie sucked. well, i cant believe that anyone, even the haters, think that this movie sucked in every aspect. that just isn't possible with AVATAR., I will give Cameron credit for a visually stunning movie. I will say this movie did hold my attention for about an hour. But special effects and great CGI only carries you so far.OK first of all, I give James Cameron credit. He has surpassed all his prior films in creating a visual masterpiece. They were glorious and beautiful and he should be commended for that. You could even call the Special effects here groundbreaking. But it's sort of like looking at the Alps or Niagara Falls. While visually stunning, that's it. The rest of the film to me was a huge empty vapid wasteland, not well written and very predictable.First of all the story. What story. I could have rented Pocahontas if I wanted to see this story. There's nothing original here. And at least Pocahontas and John Smith were real people with layers and motives that were empathetic and relatable. Who are Jake and Neytiri. I found myself not really caring about them. The story is clichéd and has been done many many many times before. I found nothing groundbreaking about it. I guess if you are a teenager you probably will love it. Me not so much.And the acting? Who needs acting when you have CGI and CGI created characters. I fear for the future of actors.Now I admit I am no James Cameron fan but I do admit he created something special with Titanic although watching the special effects in that movie now more than 10 years later, they are laughable. At least Titanic had a semblance of a story. So in 10 years plus how will Avatar's special effect's hold up. This should not be on any \"BEst of a decade list or any top 200 film list. It won't stand the test of time. Compare this to a film like Aliens(which by the way Cameron made) which is still visually appealing, had a compelling story, well rounded characters, and fine acting and there is no comparison.I think another reviewer hit the nail on the head. Hollywood is continually trying to come up with ways to draw movie goers to the theatres. Since many people can sit in the comfort of their home and watch films on their surround sound big screen TV's how do we get them coming to the theaters. Create films with huge special effects that are 3D where you can only experience maximum impact on the big screen.Maybe these geniuses in Hollywood need to figure out why films like Julie and Julie, The Blind Side, Up in the Air are drawing in film goers, and these are not big special effects films. Just good films with good acting and decent stories. These are films that stand the test of time. I can watch films like Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Aliens, time and time again and never tire of them. Avatar, Titanic, zzzzzzzzzzzz.One last disturbing tone to this film. How soon will it be before CGI created characters take the place of real like actors. Thanks James Cameron I happen to adore actors bringing their personalities and takes on characters to a film.And I will reiterate I am not anti James Cameron. I adored Aliens.By the way who wrote the score and song for this film. Truly terrible.I give this film 5 stars for the special effects. That't it., I heard that this film was going to be the benchmark in modern film making. I heard this film was to be the largest grossing film of all time, and perhaps even the most captivating. As a film lover I could not miss it, and to make sure I didn't miss out on everything James Cameron had to offer me, I saw it in the largest iMax cinema in England, in 3d. Keep in mind, I am now writing this review a week or so after seeing it so as to let my initial reactions subside and compose and sensible, rational and correct report on what I experienced, and yet my first words are still WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!Let me try and address this in an ordered fashion.Plot: Terrible, shameful and embarrassing. Not only to mention that it was almost an exact copy of Pocahontas (literally), it just wasn't at all interesting. You knew from the outset exactly how the film was going to end, it was cliché, boring and hamfisted from beginning to end. Anyone who can honestly say that the plot was captivating must be drunk, an idiot, or joking. Also, I know people go on about this, but seriously, UNOBTANIUM??? I understand trying to make a commentary on our endeavours as mankind, but calling the object unobtanium reduces the intellectual level to Sesame Street. Also, the fact that the Na'vi who could speak English went from relatively stunted English to perfect English and back again through out the film bothered me more than a little. And when the natives win that one battle, the humans, who desperately want this 'unobtanium' as it will make them all mindboggingly rich, and can afford to pay for whole armies to try and get it, give up? They just aren't going to come back? That's ridiculous, they'd nuke the place.Characters / Characterisation: Uni-dimensional to the end. No depth whatsoever. Prime example of this is the military captain who is, in all senses, a cartoon stereotype military captain, there was no reason or rhyme behind his actions apart from the fact that he is a military captain. The self-interested capitalist, who in the end was nothing more than a self-interested capitalist? No! Surely not! And the hero, who, from beginning to end, portrays no real traits that give him away to be anything other than a complete hero. Wow. I'm so impressed.Acting: No one captivated me. No one stood out. Even Sigourney Weaver, an actress who I usually hold in quite high esteem, was pretty poor. I blame Cameron.Special Effects: Yes. They were impressive. This is where my 1 star comes from. But, forgive me for being a bit of a traditionalist, but I think in any film no more than 1 star should ever be entirely devoted to special effects. That being said, they were impressive, they weren't biblical. It's not like I walked out of the cinema unable to speak from awe. Furthermore, aside from the technical quality of the special effects, the world itself was not that inventive, intelligently designed or beautiful. They were essentially in a jungle with a few animals that just looked like mutated versions of Earth animals. And some odd jellyfish type things. If you want truly beautiful films watch something like \"Pan's Labyrinth\" or \"House of Flying Daggers\", I'd say both of these have more impressive scenery than Avatar does. Directing:Uninventive. Nothing really new there. Impressive shots of scenery perhaps, but pretty much normal camera-work throughout. A very cheesy montage to show the hero and his woman getting closer and closer. A standard battle scene. No James Cameron, not impressive.The bottom line is this, I know and you know that if it wasn't for its 3D effects, and the fact that it had James Cameron's name attached to it, Avatar would probably have been straight to DVD. Some people have said that people don't like it because they don't understand Sci Fi. That's ridiculous. I love Sci Fi, it's my favourite genre. But compared with classics like Alien, or 2001, this was an affront. So shame on you James Cameron, for insulting our intelligence by thinking that nothing more than pretty lights are needed to make a good film. Though, in the end, I guess you were right, as most people seem to be inexplicably raving about it. Maybe all people want in a film are just pretty lights, and that's pretty sad to see.Poor, poor show.]\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [Okay, so....there are these people who wear leaves, live in perfect peace and harmony and faith, hope, and charity (I'd be willing to bet that they can sing \"Kum-Ba-Yah\" nonstop through an entire weekend). And they all live in this happy singing all the day long place which looks like an enormous tropical tree. But then there are rough, bad, mean people who probably don't even know the words to \"Kum-Ba-Yah\" and have big guns and lots of ugly machinery besides. They want something that can only begotten if that big tropical tree is tipped over in very dramatic fashion. And they're so nasty that they don't have any qualms about \"putting down the natives\".Okay, you get it by now, right? You've seen it in plenty of space operas, ecological parables, every movie about colonialism, and who knows where else. So....more or less like a James Bond movie, when you plunk down your money and take your seat, you know exactly what you're going to see even before the lights dim.And you just might enjoy it. The visual effects are fascinating (even to this viewer who did not see it in 3D), the acting is decent enough if a fair number of the characters are cardboard, and even though it's been done before, it's a worthy story (and probably always will be).This movie is a great thrill ride. Unfortunately, the preaching tends to get in the way of the ride, and the ride tends to get in the way of the preaching. If \"Avatar\" could simply make up its mind as to whether it wants to be a just plain cool visual experience or a polemic reaching for every cliché in the book to be a \"message movie\", it would be a lot more enjoyable to folks who are looking for either. By trying to please both, ultimately, it disappoints all.James Cameron might have done better to split the budget in half and make two separate movies with it. But....that wouldn't really be his style, would it?, Thinking about it more carefully, what I disliked the most were the religious representations of the movie, and how that appeals to the minds of those with insufficient critical skills.There's a deity, Eywa, which is some sort of brain, whereas the trees are the connections like synapses. So everything is interconnected through some sort of energy. And the deity is real, it provides not only wisdom but it also joins the fight when the tide turns. And it heals people. Or it doesn't, but it's still all for the better. And because they're one with nature, they're horrified when the tree is felled, because there's a supernatural meaning to it. And there are even initiation rites.And I'm here thinking that initiation rites have such potential for physical and emotional abuse; that healing people with energy is a deeply dangerous idea; that holding hands in prayer is utterly useless for all practical purposes; and that accepting that a woman has a \"connection\" with God, or Eywa, is so supportive of every other religious leader out there.\"It's a tribe, and it's a movie\", someone will say. But it's in fact a kind of utopic tribalism, an idea that will be attractive to many people - it has been for most of the history of mankind - but that is seriously outdated for the societies we're hoping to build, one in which we accept each other's cultural traits and deal with our many flaws. There is no tribe out there that is perfect in every way and about to be victimized by evil foreigners. There isn't. The tribes of the world are nothing like that, they're definitely not noble like that. In fact, they're based on fraudulent religious power and authoritarian political power. Tribalism and its tenets have no place in our world, and it worries me to see it so glorified on the big screen.(Another poor message: Everybody in the tribe holds hands in prayer, right after an attack. They're lost and frightened, and it takes a foreigner to instill them courage! The deity didn't do that, their own people didn't do that, in fact there was some in-fight, so it took the most recent member of the tribe, with a \"human\" mentality, to lead them into victory. Sure, the human asks for cooperation of the tribe members and specially of the alpha-male, but he's the leader. How boring, we've seen that so many times. If the tribe itself had decided to fight back, and if Jake had simply joined them... I would have liked that. It would be less of a blockbuster, but more mature).Therefore, stunning visuals aside, the morals of the film are so flawed that I'll give it only 6 stars out of 10., I felt pretty embarrassed while watching this movie, like more than when I went to see Twilight or Harry Potter. The characters have African accents and features, fake native American ''culture'' including feather head-dresses and using every part of the animal, blue smurf skin and ride around on pterodactyls like Everquest. And they do drum dances to worship a tree god. like, an actual tree that is their god. literally. not as a metaphor, and not a talking tree, just a plain old burnable wooden tree that is also their god.We are clearly meant to take all this seriously, which is the really sad part: the audience was literally laughing out loud. I mean...I've written some stuff I'd be severely embarrassed to have other people read, and then other people read it, so I can relate to the writer here. I feel bad for him. but STILL.Everyone keeps saying in the other reviews how much money is involved as if that makes the movie good when to my view it makes the whole situation even more embarrassing. There is no way i could have overestimated this movie's moronicness before seeing it, yet we've mobilized massive amounts of our modern cultural capital squarely behind something that reads like everquest fanfic. I'm a little bit frightened by all the positive reviews---I'm afraid people are going to spot me and say ''you're not one of us'' and either give me a lobotomy or try to eat me.My favorite character was definitely the corporate overlord. He refers to what they seek as ''unobtainium'' which is an old Usenet/scifi word, and I chuckled because his character was so clued-in and terse in his evilness, made it fun. but then later in the movie he shouts in a serious high-action moment ''the unobtainium is underneath that rock right there!'' and then military dudes fire on the rock, or something, as if the corporate guy doesn't realize it's not actually called unobtainium. That's just a snarky stand-in word for when you're explaining a common story to someone else and want to say ''who cares what it really is,'' when of course it _is_ something specific when you're outside a moment of reflexive exposition. It's like the writer heard some clued people talking to each other, didn't really get what they were talking about but decided he wanted to be just like them, then tried to mimic them. like when a five year old tries to swear like a drunken sailor but doesn't know how to use the words right yet so he sounds all FOB-y, the movie was like that.also like i said, they have blue skin, talk like continental Africans, and ride around on pterodactyls. please don't forget that part.

A lot of people I knew told me how good it was but I also heard many say that it did not live up to the hype. After watching this movie I have to say I'm not disappointed but I don't think it deserves all the praise it is getting. Some of my complaints are how weak the story is, to me it seems the James Cameron just copied the ideas of all the big sci-fi movies of the past 10 years and combined them together. Also the story was very predictable, I knew what was going to happen almost from the very beginning and nothing surprised me. While their were some good things about it like the visuals and special effects that does not make a movie and the visual did not make the movie any better. But like I said it was not a complete disappointment. It did have some good action sequences and some decent dialogue even though most of the rest of the dialogue was crap. So overall it was just an average action movie and I don't see how this could be nominated for awards over so much better sci-fi movies out this year like District 9, Moon, and Star Trek. Which I think are all better movies then this and would pick any one of their directors to be nominated for a directors guild award over James Cameron, James Cameron; what a chance you had here.When I saw the reviews praising this as a piece of brilliance, I thought I had to see it. I didn't watch it for a while, but eventually got round to putting it on and seeing what all the fuss was about. It probably didn't help that my expectations were so high, but I was so disappointed by what I saw. I really wanted and tried to like this film, but I couldn't.To start with, the film is incredibly long. It's such a needless length for a film that is really quite basic in it's plot and story. After an hour and a half I was watching the clock tick down, and then it drags on for another hour or so. It doesn't need to be that long. It almost feels like when you write an essay or do a piece of homework and you need to get to a word count, but you're 500 words short. So you just waffle about everything and anything that you can think of. That's very much what this movie is.Don't get me wrong, it's visually stunning. If you get a chance to watch it in HD or 3D, then please do because it does make a massive difference. The world in which it takes place in is a real quality piece of animation and it is the high point of the movie. The only problem is that, after a while, it starts feeling like it's boasting and becoming complacent. You see the visuals and you think \"wow!\". Then you're an hour in and you've got over the visuals and you're looking for something more. You just don't get it. There's nothing more to give, and it just becomes a bit like it's constantly reminding you how good it looks, and it does look great. When the credits roll, it should be that you can't stop thinking and talking about the quality of the visuals but, instead, you end up not appreciating them as you should, and would, in any other film that looks as stunning as this does.Because the film is 160 minutes long, it's hard to remain interested in the plot and storyline. It feels like it's a chore to watch. I think one of it's flaws is that it doesn't seem to have a genre nailed down. Is it a romance? Is it action? Is it fantasy? In the end, it mashes it all together and feels like it's lost in this mystical world. Many films get away with not focusing on a specific criteria, but this one is so bold in how it tries to display the movie, that it feels like it could do with just picking one or two (at a push) and focusing entirely on that. One of it's major strengths is the peaceful nature of the setting, but the end action sequence (which seems to go on for an eternity) ruins that feeling and overshadows any depth the film has. Don't get me wrong, I like action. It just doesn't belong in a film like this, certainly not for that length of time.And the blue individuals just don't quite do it for me. They look strangely animated to start with, and there's something missing. It's almost too simplistic for everything else the film stands for. They don't appear complex enough as people or in appearance. The main character is a bit emotionless. I don't know if it's his voice or not but he doesn't feel like he has enough substance.Musically it's good. It coincides with scenes to give you that powerful feeling and, again, reminds you that you should be impressed by how it looks. It acts almost as a prompt for when you should go \"yeah, that bit is cool\".There is a good film in there, but it's just been mashed up a bit too much. The length makes it hard to retain focus on such a predictable plot and you don't end up caring or hating any of the characters. If it had been a bit shorter (maybe 90-105 minutes), it may have been better and I might have clicked with it more. The expectation probably didn't help either, I'll admit. It thinks it can get by on how good it looks but it can't. It needs something more than that, but doesn't find it. It's a shame.It was just a visually stunning disappointment for me, which goes on so long you forget what happened in the first half an hour, and don't really care that you can't remember.It was a fraction short of being an 8/10, for me, but it fell short for trying too much at once., I was not blown away by this movie like everyone else seems to be. First, the good stuff. There are some good actors in here, especially the actor who plays Jake (though I might be biased, because he was pretty hot), and they all commit to what they're doing and make it believable. As everyone says, the graphics and visuals are pretty freakin' awesome (as well they should be, with the budget of this movie). The world that Cameron creates is stunning, mesmerizing, and pure: the special effects are amazing. Like many, I saw it in 3D and it was good old fashioned movie-going fun. Yay! Okay, now for the not so good parts. As others have stated, the storyline/plot is a little lacking. I had trouble understanding the motivations of many of the characters. Ah, yes, character development - that would have been nice, too. Don't expect any. Yes, it's a recycled and re-used plot: clichéd and often predictable. It seems reminiscent of many great classics, my favorite being \"Star Wars.\" Now I'll be the first to admit that the mythical structure of \"Star Wars\" was not completely original, but at least it seemed Lucas \"made it his own\" (to quote American Idol?) with his original characters and unique setting. \"Avatar\" is practically plagiarism (one line in particular made me want to shout \"THE FORCE!\" in the middle of the movie). Also- we get practically no character background at all, so we have no idea what makes these people tick (perhaps there would have been more if the edited version wasn't already a staggering 2 hrs 40 min.). Instead, we get one-dimensional, stock characters that had me rolling my eyes underneath my uncomfortable and overpriced 3D glasses. Lastly, the film is doused with lessons in morality from Mr. Cameron; it is a blatant criticism of US foreign policy. Not everyone will pick up on this, which I understand, since most of us want mindless entertainment at the movies. But upon closer review, I don't see how some people cannot see it. One of the \"evil\" characters actually says: \"We'll fight terror with terror!\" (Though mind you, they are attacking a planet filled with peaceful inhabitants who have never attacked them, for the simple quest of obtaining a precious metal called...unobtainium...::rolls eyes again::) Now I don't mind a little political satire here and there, but it seems misplaced in what is seemingly intended as a mindlessly entertaining popcorn flick.To give an example of the poor story-telling and lack of motivation: the \"evil\" humans are attacking the peaceful planet of Pandora in hopes of getting more \"unobtainium\" (gah it's so cheesy) but Cameron never bothers to tell us WHY. It is barely even mentioned. Is it just pretty and shiny like gold? Or, as another reviewer brilliantly pointed out, this stuff could save lives on Earth for all we know. It is never explained and the movie makers just assume you will accept it and not care what the reason is. I was actually really glad to come to IMDb and find there were others who felt the same way. I don't think it was an awful movie, I just don't think it's worthy of the enormous praise that seems to surround it. Should you see it? Yeah, sure, it's pretty entertaining I guess. And if you are into graphics/special effects, and/or don't mind gaping plot holes, then you'll probably love it.Bottom line: Remember when Lucas revamped the \"Star Wars\" saga with the three new prequels, and instead of telling a great story with interesting characters like he did with the original trilogy, he got so obsessed with graphics and special effects that it pretty much ruined the whole movie? Yeah, it's kind of like that. I guess they stole that from \"Star Wars,\" too.]\n",

                                                                     [Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine who travels to the world of Pandora to do what he thinks is protecting the Earth. The natives of that world are said to be vicious and cruel. By transforming into one of them in his sleep (or something) he realizes they are NOT the evil ones and he begins to have serious doubts about his mission. This leads to an all out battle at the end.Basically this is cowboys vs. Indians in outer space. This is VERY easy to follow and understand which is the main problem. Everything here is totally and utterly predictable! You've seen these characters and situations all before. I was always one or two steps ahead on the plot and this isn't good for a movie that runs a needless 165 minutes. This could have easily been wrapped up in 90 minutes. Some people find getting into the world of the aliens is fascinating. I wasn't fascinated at all--just thoroughly and utterly bored! To make matters worse the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book and the characters are either evil or good--no shades of grey or ambiguity. The movie also preaches it's against war but \"entertains\" us with an all out battle at the end. Lots of people agree that the plot is light but the incredible special effects make up for it. Not for me! Yeah the special effects are impressive (especially in 3-D) but that isn't enough for such a long movie with a dull storyline. I can't really comment on the acting here considering no one is given a character to play--they're all walking, talking clich√©s. Only two people stand out--Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver. Worthington is very handsome with beautiful eyes and a cute little Australian accent. Weaver is strong and commanding playing a scientist.I will admit the battle at the end was (kind of) fun but I was mostly bored silly throughout this. I kept looking at my watch patiently waiting for this to end. I have to admit I'm in the minority here. It's gotten rave reviews from critics and has already broken box office records. I attended a 4:30 show on a Saturday afternoon--and it was sold out! It's also among the top 50 movies here on IMDb. I guess a lot of people like predictable stories with non-stop special effects and cardboard characters. I need something more than that. The 2 is only for the effects and hot Worthington., The full movie is take your breath away! I have to admit that it's quite easy to impress me, but when i left the cinema I was just amazed. First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think.The movie really impressed me it has the best specials effects you could ever seen, and the movie was really intense, with explosions screams, cries and other things. The action takes place in 2154 on Pandora who is the theater of the shock between human beings come exploit a rare ore and the natives population, the Na' vi who live in perfect symbiosis with their environment and try to defend themselves in front of the militarized invasion. The central character of the story is Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine which, via its adversity, is going to have to choose his camp with as stake the fate of the planet.The Surrounding on \"Pandora\" doesn't let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. The emotions displayed on the characters faces were incredibly detailed, especially Neytiri. It all looked so real.... The flying scenes were incredible, and the scenes when the humans interact with the Na'Vi were flawless. It was amazing. But what I liked the most was the scrip and the story between the Navi and the human ever if I particularly love how the actors were modernize. The scene which really gave me a big thrill is the final fight. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also.It looked so real... I really wanted it to never end .This was probably the first movie that I actually was disappointed that it ended. I spend a real good time watching this movie and I think I will remember oh it for a long time. Avatar was probably the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. The special effects were jaw-dropping, and i didn't even see the movie in 3-D., It was hard to believe that two hours and forty minutes had passed by the time this movie ended. This movie takes off right from the get-go, grabs a hold of you and drags you on a spectacular ride that leaves you breathless by the end. You've probably seen a few people say \"it's Dances With Wolves on an alien planet,\" or \"the storyline is too archetypal/predictable,\" but those don't scratch the surface. There's so much going on in this movie, and even the shortest of scenes can carry so much weight if you're paying honest attention to it.One of my biggest concerns going into this movie was that there would be 45 minutes or more of buildup before you really reached paydirt. There wasn't, and I don't know what it was about the trailers that made me think otherwise. You barely get 10-15 minutes of introduction to the characters before Jake is logged into his Avatar and testing it out. Like you could see in the trailer, he's simply thrilled to have working legs under him again, and Cameron did an absolutely phenomenal job of capturing what might have been a minor fact were this anyone else's film. Just the look on Jake's avatar's face when he starts wiggling his toes is brilliant.Nothing about this movie is simple; even when a scene appears to have little importance, the way Cameron has brought them all together makes each only a piece of what turns into a beautiful puzzle. The death and burial of an old Na'vi woman whose name is never revealed lasts all of maybe 8-10 seconds, and yet Sam Worthington's voice-over during the part makes it have such a huge impact. It's like the first time you see the creature in Alien: it's only 6 frames but it sticks with you throughout the movie and beyond. And that's the point here: people are going to talk about the visuals and your first instinct will be to think they mean the CGI, but that's not the case. The visuals are stunning in every way imaginable; each small scene is important, every facet of Na'vi life that is shown carries some weight - particularly to Jake - and the amount of work put into their tails, ears, eyes, and the motion-capture used for their facial expressions was worth every penny.The CGI is beyond phenomenal, and what Cameron has done here is kill any excuse by future movie-makers for having shoddy CGI. It's seamless, and it's hard to tell where live action ends and CGI begins much of the time - in fact, you won't even realize you're going from one to the other even when you go from the Na'vi to the humans and back. Even in those scenes where you have both humans and Na'vi on the screen together or even touching, it's clean and beautiful and only multiplies the effect. I was fortunate to see this movie at the IMAX-3D theatre, and it was worth the extra money: all that talk about birds and insects and whatnot flying through scenes wasn't just talk - it's incredible to behold.This movie may require the more faint of heart to bring a box of tissues with them. This is not the type of movie where someone dies and the main and supporting characters just go all crazy with rage and become ten times more fierce. Again Cameron has captured the grief surrounding the deaths of friends and loved ones with a deep intensity that is, at times, crushing (some of the scenes still bring tears to my eyes twelve hours later, and I don't cry at movies). Referring back to the scene I mentioned earlier with the burial of the Na'vi woman - it's very intense, powerful stuff, especially considering that the scene is seconds long and she's never named; if you're not getting an emotional jolt out of this movie then you're truly missing out on half of its power.On the way out of the theatre there were a few people complaining that it was predictable, even though they really liked it; the ultimate point is that Cameron has told a beautiful story, and despite the times when you go \"Oh, I know what he's going to do now,\" it's very easy to become attached to the characters, and care what happens to them. When people die, it hurts; Cameron has established all of the major characters to a point where you don't look at them and think \"This guy's cannon fodder.\" All of them are integral to the story, and even during the epic battle toward the end of the movie, it's hard not to be moved by the casualties of even nameless Na'vi.Cameron is very proud of this movie and he should be; considering his history of Aliens, Terminator, Terminator2, and Titanic, it's hard to just look at something like this and say it's his best - but I truly feel this is. As much as I loved Aliens (formerly my favorite movie of all time), it did not move me the way Avatar did. I doubt any other movie ever will. DO NOT wait to see this on DVD or Blue-Ray; get to the theatre and watch this jewel of cinematography. If you can, see it on the IMAX-3D screen. You won't regret it, and I guarantee that.To parents wondering how children might handle this, the PG-13 rating is mostly due to language and the violence of the epic battle. There's no sex in the movie, though it is mentioned and there is a sort of fade-to-black that's confirmed later on. Last but not least, you do see Na'vi breasts from time to time but it's done tastefully, rarely, and in such a way that it's not throwing it in your face - if you're not looking at the right part of the screen you likely won't even notice.]\n",

Box DVD.Reluctantly, I watched this piece of liberal, tree-hugging subversive, propaganda. I cannot believe that this is the biggest grossing motion picture of all time and that it was nominated for (and won) a plethora of awards.Here's the deal in a nutshell: All Americans/white people are evil and native peoples are good, noble, peaceful, and in tune with nature. Got it?The climactic battle is intended to bring the audience to cheer for those enemies killing US Marines and the traitorous humans who are helping them. Uhhh... go Taliban?The tired, Liberal story of the evil white devils losing their souls as they rape and plunder an innocent world for its mineral wealth is about as cutting edge as a dull baby spoon.And, even as these anti-American propaganda films go, this one is particularly poorly written, directed, acted, and the CGI is unremarkable as well. James Cameron has sunk to a new low - even for James Cameron.The names of things in the movie and the ridiculously transparent \"symbolism\" would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetically treasonous in a time of war.Planet: \"Pandora\" (or \"Pandorum\" - whatever). Are you kidding me? Boy, we opened a real Pandora's box here... Please! Mineral being sought: \"Unobtainium\". Really? So, we are supposed to be surprised when it turns out to be... unobtainable?I could go on with the Pentagon-shaped emblems and Human compound, but I just don't feel like it.Anti-Hero Jake Sully is supposed to be a disabled US Marine but they got the cardboard Sam Worthington to pay him without even the effort of trying to cover his British accent. The cartoon-like \"Kill 'em All\" Marine Colonel Quaritch is played with somnambulism by the obviously Soap-Opera-trained Stephen Lang. It appears he spent all of his prep time in the gym, because it sure wasn't on acting. The greedy corporate stereotype Parker Selfridge (Selfish?!?!) was phoned in by the usually talented Giovanni Ribisi. These actors should be ashamed of themselves. I know: \"Crying all the way to the bank.\" But would you betray your country for thirty pieces of silver (even at today's prices)? Oh, that's right: Worthington isn't American, so he doesn't give a rat's rear-end that people will cheer for dead US Marines.Let me guess: This movie was written by brace-faced teenage girls in the Mall, right? If you are a real American, and claim to \"support our troops,\" you would be well-advised to stay away from this movie and anything Cameron does from this point forward. He is a Left- wing traitor to his country and is not even very good at that., Newspaper resident right-wing spleen merchants have written this movie off as a product of James Cameron's hippie sensibilities (Nature good, Civilisation bad) but the plot is so ordinary it is not likely to have much persuasive value. Visually it is something else. With Planet Pandora (technically a moon), Cameron, inspired by the Amazonian rain forest and Jurassic Park, not only has created a 3-D world of beauty and splendour, he has staged some truly spectacular action sequences, particularly in the air (Harry Potter and his flying broomsticks on steroids). The average viewer is going to be swept away by this, not by the clunky plot, which revolves around a mining venture on a distant planet being obstructed by the locals who are justifiably upset by the intrusion.What upsets the Right's cheer brigade is the \"simplistic\" portrayal of the military as moronic thugs, when we have all those brave men and women out there defending freedom and our oil supplies price in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since this is a science fiction fable the analogy is likely to be lost on most viewers – they are more likely to see it as a steal from \"GI Joe\"). As Jake Sully, the central character who changes sides in the battle, Sam Worthington is not a traitor to his race, as the cartoonish Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) calls him, but someone who realises that what is being done to the planet and its people in the quest for \"unobatinium\" is morally unjustified. Perhaps our columnists would like to take a look at what has been done to the environment and population by mining in New Guinea, for example.Leaving aside the politics, Sam Worthington has just the presence for his part. It was nice to see Sigorney Weaver, an old hand in Cameron movies, back as the crusty but likable scientist Dr Grace. I also liked Giovanni Ribisi as Selfridge the mine manager once I realized he wasn't Jerry Seinfeld. He was the epitome of the corporate shyster. The unsung heroes of all this are the animation and special effects people , hundreds of them including Weta of NZ, who have put their experience in Lord of the Rings to good use.To revert to the political, we might ask why there is an apparent \"left wing\" bias in Hollywood movies. The answer of course is that the Right have no imagination, a vital attribute for a successful innovative movie maker. Cameron might write clunky plots and corny dialogue, but there's nothing wrong with his visual imagination, and he has the ability to engage the primal fears of his audience, if not their intellects, and to entertain., You can really see where the $250,000,000 went. There's color and texture through every inch of the screen. And like every James Cameron film there is no expense spared on live sets. He really knows how to fill up a sound stage.The story is really something to behold. A paralyzed soldier is recruited to pick up where his brother leaves off and gets new legs in the form of his avatar, a tribal, jungle dweller sent to stake out the traditions of a people for the purpose of reporting back their weaknesses so that they can be forced to move in order to obtain the rich natural resources that exists under their Lifetree, the source of their heritage and oneness.When he falls in love with one of the female villagers and with the way of life of the peaceful, naturebound \"People\" he entertains second thoughts.One can imagine the results. He's forced to make a decision. One to do what is right and protect a people susceptible to the strengths and ruthlessness of a greedy corporation, or back the plan of the Marines to remove or even eliminate the people for financial gain.One cannot help but to draw comparisons between what we see on the screen (filmed during the Bush administration) and our presence in the Middle East and the American greed for oil.The results are horrific. The ruthlessness is horrific to say the least. It is somewhat manipulative, and one can see clearly James Cameron's political bent. He paints the Marines as evil and willing to destroy the people with no more conscience than one would wipe out an ant hill.The People fight back, with the help of the protagonist and a few Human friends and score some very deadly blows against the \"evil\" Marines.I have never liked seeing American troops being killed, even when they're portrayed as being bad. I think the first, and maybe only time I've seen this is in the kid's movie, \"Small Soldiers\" and even then they were toys and not people.The best message that the movie delivers is the need to respect not only the cultures of others regardless of our potential richening, but that the Earth is not merely a resource by which we satisfy our greedy desires but that we can live amongst nature and with it and cooperate with it, thereby being mutually benefited.The message is a little heavy handed at times, and it can be a little distracting, but the beauty of the film's art is awe inspiring and James Camercon's love of detail takes one's breath away.To see Sigourney Weaver do what she does, even at 61, is wonderful. Is another Ripley vehicle in store? We shall see.8 out of 10.]\n",

From Terminator to Alien to Titanic, he really hasn't made a bad movie. But after Titanic he spent the last decade making and trying to build up his new movie which he dubs \"will change film making.\" If he was intending on changing film making in the way that 3D glasses will be more acceptable in movies then he succeeded. If he was intending on creating new character archetypes and changing the way storytelling is done then he didn't. But despite the obvious \"Dances with Smurfs\" joke that everyone and their mother has already mentioned, the movie is pretty damn impressive. Sure it doesn't have the most original story but the execution is really well done. For me this is really the first 3D movie that succeeds mainly because it doesn't feel like a gimmick is being forced on you. It's simply there to give you a more realistic feel and its easily the best looking movie of the year. Cameron's obvious strengths are in directing action sequences and this is easily seen in the final 40 minutes of the movie. As for the acting he did a pretty good job there too. Zoe Saldana is the star of the show and was obviously wasted in Star Trek. All the other actors are maybe a little above average and they advance the story very well. On the script level, the film feels a bit clunky at points. Most notably is in the opening 20 minutes of the film where everything feels rushed. It jumps almost immediately into the story instead of easing us in. Also the last 40 minutes of the movie which is just a big action movie essentially, the script also feels dumbed down a bit. But despite this problem the script works more often then it doesn't.As for the characters, although most of the acting is good, the characters are very two- dimensional. They're characters you seen in other movies before and nothing new is added to them. But the movie is really plot driven or character driven so it is easily overlooked.Really this movie is all about the visuals and more importantly the 3D. I have had a really bad hatred for 3D in the past so when Cameron pulled this off by creating a subtle effect, it proved that 3D can work for a movie, even though the movie doesn't actually need it. But it's proof that it doesn't need to be shoved in your face. All the colours and effects of the movie make it feel more like a roller coaster. I won't spend to much on the story other than saying while not original or extremely deep, it is very well told and keeps the movie going.So is it worth it? Don't go in expecting the most intelligent film of the year but you should expect the best looking one. Technologically Cameron did succeed on making his movie, changing cinema technically and even if it is slightly empty in the middle it is one hell of a good time at the movies. Especially in 3D., I'm writing this review after watching this film the night before seeing it's extremely belated sequel at the cinema.Honestly, I think this film still looks utterly amazing even if was released today. The scale, the scope, the attention to detail is still simply beyond anything that was ever released before or since.James Cameron is responsible for a chunk of my absolute favourite movies. The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, T2, True Lies, Titanic - they are all masterpieces of action/sci fi blockbuster cinema with every release representing a massive leap in the technical side of the craft in one way or another, and it feels like this film is a cumulation of these amazing movies. You can see the 'lived in' military feel of aliens and the first terminator here - he has realised the APC and mech suit from his 1986 masterpiece in their fullest glory, the CGI and lighting from T2, the gorgeous luminosity from the ET's in the Abyss, the thudding action of true lies, the epic sweep of Titanic - it all manifests here and then some.The visuals here though at the end of 2022 are frankly astounding still, from the cold military feel on the human side to the lush, gorgeous, colourful world of Pandora this film is a visual treat from start to finish. The human's technology looks utterly realistic and plausible, with every ship, screen and weapon looking like it actually exists instead of it being fantasy tech. Each animal and plant, wether it's something attacking our heroes or a background creature looks like it's had the utmost of thought paid to it's design, colour and sound. Put simply, it creates a world that you have never seen in your wildest dreams and it all works in harmony with everything in this beautiful movie. 13 years on and to me, it still looks pretty much perfect and still above every other blockbuster ever made.And boy does James Cameron know how to direct an action scene. He was already the master pretty much but here you can see it in all it's glory. Every action scene is crisp, clear, coherent yet visceral. Just witness for example the brief scene where the dog type beast near the beginning of the film gets hold of Jakes rucksack - the camera pans around the scene, in slow mo for a few seconds whilst jake wriggles free and attempts to escape, it's a simple yet effective scene that sums up the directors skill in this field, which basically reads 'unmatched' - it's just a small yet subtle reminder of this amazing director's skillset in crafting intimate action scenes or massive set pieces, of which there are many in this.The biggest criticism that most people level at this tends to be the derivative plot, and if I'm honest, it's still a valid criticism.The thing is though, I simply don't care.This film is so utterly immersive, in ways that nothing has ever been before, it just makes up for any storytelling shortcomings. The world building here is off the scale amazing, you really feel like Pandora is a living, breathing place - it's not unlike one of the recent Rockstar games in that you lose yourself in this amazing environment and it seems almost odd when you have to extract yourself from it at the end and rejoin the real world.Big screen entertainment doesn't really get a higher endorsement than that does it?Yes the story is something you will have seen before, but it is well executed, does exactly what it needs to do and no more. It still manages to hit some excellent emotional beats and to be honest, if it were a complicated plot it would detract from what this movie says and does. It has a strong environmental and anti war message which is central to the narrative here and works just like the themes of motherhood in aliens and fatherhood in T2 etc. It's what I come to expect from James Cameron - simple and effective storytelling.For me, this is just an absolute lesson in blockbuster filmmaking and is a must see. I saw this in 3D IMAX in 2009 and it was pretty much the best cinema experience I think I've ever had, but even watching this at home on blu ray it still looks cutting edge 13 years later.An easy 10 out of 10. Never underestimate James Cameron., So was the experience worth it? You bet, save for the end credits being unceremoniously cut off toward the end because of another screening. James Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction and the creation of new worlds, having been there and done that, even when there are quarters which point to plot similarities. He had continued Ridley Scott's Alien and made the sequel just as, if not even more memorable, having a Titanic film that stood out amongst those created before his technological marvel, gave spy films a good run with his True Lies, and even upping the ante of his own Terminator film with its sequel (which those that followed struggling hard to fill those shoes he left behind).To say Cameron was a technology junkie is quite the understatement. For each film that he made, there's something new added with a Wow factor, and I still remember to this day the liquid T1000 rising from a patterned floor, making the ugly Harrier jet look sexy, and made us gawk at the recreation of the ill fated ocean liner. Between that film and this one, he had made another 3D documentary exploring the wreckage of the Titanic, and I've watched that on 3D IMAX, which sadly such a hall no longer exists in Singapore. The 3D experience now with Avatar is nothing short of mind-blowing, for the first few minutes at least, and it subconsciously just melts into the background as you continue to enjoy the visuals of the film, hardly noticing the effort that had gone in creating that depth of field or the photo- realism of the fantasy realm of beautiful alien flora and floating mountains, as if you're now watching something real that's unfolding as if you're staring out with your very own eyes, witnessing a perfect blend of live action and computer generated wizardry.He's created a new world with Avatar, which may have jolly well been Dances with Science Fiction Wolves, or any parallels with other films cutting so close that it's easy to scream plagiarism, but like the title of the film, it's only a vessel in which to tell the story of what's probably a major mind-set shift of how a science fiction 3D film should be like, and exploited for the modern audience. The story has been told countless of times in many different forms, about the prophetic messiah who would come from outside the community, to lead them against adversary. And although the idea has been reported mooted at least a decade back, one cannot but feel how close the concept of Nature Vs Man being all the more relevant now, with that constant reminder that Nature will fight back one day, and Man will be on the losing end should we be up against a concerted force.Sam Worthington continues his charge as leading man material, even though he's covered in blue and in gangly animated form for more than half the time He's the perennial flawed hero (and I think come complete with touched up limbs) who sees his initial mission as a chance to reclaim what was, only to find that the grass is greener on the other side, due to what else, but love. That pits him against his master, and his dilemma to regain the trust of a community that he had chosen to betray and regret. I can't help but to compare his Marine Jack Sully to Kevin Costner's John Dunbar, with his time spent living amongst the natives (here it's 3 months worth) and to learn their ways, so much so that he's more of them than he is from his own, despite the need to report back, and knowing that they will be the eventual enemy when push comes to shove regarding land and minerals.And the great good versus evil divide comes from Colonel Miles, played to wicked perfection by Stephen Lang as the war mongering officer who just can't wait to lock and load and pick a fight given any opportunity, and the diplomatic scientist Dr. Grace (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew, who are all for mutual co-existence and the sharing of cultures in a bid to understand what makes the native Na'vi tick, not to mention the countless of secrets that lie hidden in their eco-system, besides some valuable mineral to mine, the largest deposit which is sitting directly under the Na'vi's million year old giant tree.In the Na'vis, Cameron has created quite the indigenous alien beings complete with a pigtail, which can be used to plug into nature, from binding and controlling just about every living creature (there was a mating scene, though I didn't get to see if this was put to good use), and to plug themselves into a spiritual realm as well. I suppose this provides for plenty of empathy, and I liked the part where Zoe Saldana's Neytiri chides Jake for thanking her when she fatally dispatches the more aggressive beings which in a way, were provoked to action. Action too is something not short of in the film, though one must be patient for that full scale, all out war that was done quite in the mold of Battle For Terra, leaving you without a doubt who to root for.I don't suppose this film will make as much at the box office as Cameron's last even though it shared that similar romantic angle behind events that are of a higher magnitude. Instant classic this is not, but Avatar has its moments, primed for a sequel or even for an expanded television series, that could continue on its ecological message, its technical wizardry, or just plain old narrative familiarity that could put the spotlight on the other hastily added clans that made up the final stretch.]\n",

Though some people refused to consider it a great movie, mostly because it lacked in originality and did not live up to its extremely high expectations. To be honest the movie really wasn't revolutionary, it was just really good. Thus I still insist on giving it a good rating. The movie followed the same concept as many previous movies, being that mankind is evil and are aggressive consumers of worlds. The movie kind of represents symbolism for both the indigenous people being forced out of their land (Like the Colonist/ Indian conflict). It also represents our war in the sense that our ambition is a war in desire of oil, or supply. Indeed many movies in the past have based their meaning on these subjects, but what is wrong with repetition if the outcome is good? It is how the concepts are composed is what matters. And I believe that if any viewer of Avatar, will drop their boundaries; even a little, will like this movies. Granted the story did not consist of extremely deep meaning compared to the more popular and intellectual movies, but it still proved interesting. I must also add that some of the movies that critics claim Avatar to have stolen from I have not seen, thus I suppose their is an exception to have not liked this movie. Still I enjoyed the story and its' characters.Now as for the visuals, they were better than almost every movie I have seen, but not revolutionary. As I watched previews of this movie I noticed a blend between reality and animation, thus I had a high expectation of the movies' visuals. Unfortunately throughout the movie it was pretty easy to tell when it was animation and when it was not. It was like the matrix in the sense that when Jake entered the alien world you knew it was not real. Perhaps if the Na'vi were not as colorful, and in bright colors, my opinion would be otherwise. Despite that the visuals were still great. I must also point out that in this movie James Cameron has created an interesting and unique world, in which I compare to even Star Wars itself. The Na'vi are basically gargantuan humans with blue skin and elf ears, but still very cool to look at, even to be attracted too \"cough\" Neytiri. The creatures and even the futuristic technology expressed are simply amazing. So another great feature Avatar contains.Critics of this story would argue against its simplicity as it is a well known concept in terms of a war between natives and conquerors, but it doesn't mean the story was bad. Even if you argue that the main conflict lacked originality, James Cameron exposed other intriguing ideas, such as the transfer of ones mind to another body and even the metaphor between the internet and the planets forest. If you can not enjoy this movie, you are too critical and I recommend dropping your boundaries, for I assume you would dislike almost every movie, making your experience in modern entertainment rather dull, despite the exception I mentioned earlier. In truth this movie may not deserve a 10 maybe an 8 or 9, but I give it a 10 to counter those whom give it low ratings for almost ridiculous reasons. I highly recommend seeing Avatar to all people and hope you will enjoy it as much as I have., Let me start this off with a few words on originality in film. I like to judge movies on a purely subjective level, so the originality of a plot or idea is is only relevant to me insofar as it begets predictability. So, while I criticize Avatar for being an extremely predictable film, I don't consider its supposed lack of originality, probably its most universally criticized aspect, to be relevant. Cross-medium adaptations don't catch any flak because they acknowledge their intent to re-film the same plot. Instead they are judged on how well they are able to capitalize on the storytelling strengths of the new medium while retelling said plot. No Country For Old Men is a perfect example of this. And I'm telling you that Avatar is an example of this as well. The 3D film is used so well in this film, it transcends \"gimmick\" status and becomes an amazing tool of immersion. It sounds like a studio-issued tag-line, but really, you have not experienced a film the way that you experience this one in 3D, on a large screen. You have seen this story before, but with Avatar you really feel like you are experiencing it through a whole new medium.Okay, that was more than a few words. Sorry. Here is my actual review:There are two things that this film does so well that its flaws are completely overshadowed (flaws such as frequently weak dialogue, a handful of cheese, predictable plot, lack of secondary character development).First, it shows Jake Sully's gradual immersion into Pandora and Na'vi culture, and brings us along for the ride. His character arc is sublimely executed, and the world in which it occurs is mind-blowingly cool and fully realized (It is also worth noting that the love story is almost embarrassingly sincere, which I consider to be a plus, but can be kind of awkward to watch with friends). By the end of the film you will feel like you yourself have spent time living among the Na'vi on Pandora, and it is a truly intoxicating experience (I want to fly around on a dragon too, damn it). Leaving the theater, I had the feeling that you get after waking up from a very pleasant dream: genuinely disappointed that it isn't real, but still high from the experience.Seriously, I would kill for either: A: a zombie apocalypse; B: a trip to Pandora Second, it sets up and executes the mother of all action sequences. The film gradually builds tension over its 160 min. running time, contrasting Jake's love for his newfound life with escalating displays of imperialist douchebaggery culminating in a couple of tragedies that really hit you where it hurts. I already knew exactly how the final battle would turn out, but god damn did I want to see it happen. Now, some people view any kind of action scene as a flaw for reasons I cannot fathom, but as an action movie aficionado, my eyes honestly welled up at the absolute magnitude of spectacle that I was witnessing. Maybe it was the IMAX, and maybe it was the 3D, but this movie had absolutely the greatest climactic action scene I have ever seen. I mean, better than the hospital sequence in Hard Boiled or the church scene in The Killer, better than anything in the Matrix trilogy, better than the last 20 minutes of Raiders of Wu-tang or the last 10 minutes of The Mystery of Chessboxing, better than any of Cameron's previous action scenes, and certainly better than any of Michael Bay's incoherently edited crap.Avatar is a remarkably focused, entertaining, and well-paced epic. Never have I seen a film of this length that felt so short. There Will Be Blood, probably my favorite film of the decade, is about the same length but feels twice as long. Not once during the running time of this film was I bored. Yes, the film has a few flaws that would be enough to cripple a lesser film, but in the face of what this film achieves, they seem negligible. This is not a film that tries to impress you through its plot; it focuses entirely on visceral entertainment. Aside from the initial exposition, any time that is not spent on some sort of immersing spectacle is spent setting up some sort of immersing spectacle, and yet it never feels like empty entertainment; we are always emotionally attached to the characters and events. Avatar is a remarkable achievement and sets a new benchmark for blockbusters that I fear not many will be able to meet.I give it a 9.5 out of 10, but I think it deserves a 10 more than it deserves a 9., Literally thousands of people have already written reviews about AVATAR - some qualified, some not so qualified - so why would I feel the urge to post my first ever movie review about it? Maybe because it has been the first movie for more than a decade that made me wish to see (or rather: EXPERIENCE) it right again the moment the credits started rolling and the lights went on. Definitely because the overwhelming majority of critical reviews to me seem to be exactly what they accuse AVATAR to be: schematic, one-dimensional, simplified, predictable and with lots of well known content.I agree with those characterizing the story to be simple, predictable and quite an eclectic blend of well known stories, BUT that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not working or even being a bad one. On the contrary, it's simplicity helps the general audience to not get lost along the way and focus on the really new and unique aspects, namely the exposure to a completely unfamiliar environmental and cultural setting. The level of detail Cameron has put into creating this earth-like planet (moon, technically) together with all the flora and fauna hasn't been seen since Tolkien's Middlearth. What makes it even more compelling is that almost every aspect really has a solid and believable scientific foundation. Although fitted with a simple structure, the story never tends to be dumb like in so many other blockbusters, especially those dealing with science-fiction. On the contrary, Cameron manages to pick up quite a lot of current social, political and environmental issues (e.g. ignorance against foreign cultures/civilizations, privatization of warfare, corporate profits before morale and the well being of others) and still makes it entertaining instead of boring.With AVATAR Cameron has proved again that he can not only deliver in terms of action but especially when it comes to telling a simple story in such a way that it's almost impossible to not feel emotionally touched and involved. I've seen this movie several times by now and each time I could feel the same emotional grip all over the audiences, quite a lot leaving the theater with tears in their eyes. Unlike Bay or Emmerich, Cameron has mastered to reach out to a broad audience far beyond the young and predominantly male focus group for action movies and get it to bond with the characters instead of just watching an effects-laden movie.In terms of visual effects AVATAR absolutely is the game changer Cameron had promised it to be. While there have been other movies using 3D lately not one of them succeeded like this one in not using 3D as a mere gimmick but instead as an essential part of the cinematic experience. After a few minutes of adjusting you get completely submerged into the movie and it makes you feel like you are really taking part in an event unfolding around you instead of just watching a pre-recorded performance.Although the use of 3D helped considerably in making this movie a submersing experience it's only second place in terms of technical achievement when you consider the leap forward in creating believable human(oid) CGI characters this movie represents. After being left with more or less creepy feelings watching \"The Polar Express\" and \"Beowulf\" where the CGI characters had more resemblance to zombies than to living human beings, I was quite skeptical about Cameron's ability to live up to his promises and was blown away when I finally did watch the movie. Especially the close ups in many emotionally touching scenes, where even the tiniest recognizable artificiality of the CGI characters would have ruined everything (e.g. on dying Eytucan after the destruction of the Hometree, Neytiri hiding behind a tree and watching the soldiers closing in on her or Neytiri breaking up in tears after she barely managed to save Jake from suffocation) did deliver on such a great level that I am still in awe. I have watched the close up of Naytiri hiding behind a tree and watching the soldiers closing in on her from the official Trailer in Full HD over and over again and still I can't see any hint on her being a CGI character.A third an not to be underestimated technical innovation that helped a lot in delivering a convincing CGI environment is the virtual camera that was used to capture the performances as if shot with a real camera in the currently so famous hand-held style which added another layer of realism, especially to the action sequences (e.g. Jake getting chased by the Thanator or flying next to Neytiri when she takes her Ikran for a ride around the Hometree).Regarding James Horner's score I do have mixed feelings. It ranges from well done to excellent for most parts of the movie and considerably adds to the emotional impact in many scenes (e.g. the arrival in space at that mystical moon Pandora, the devastation of the Na'vi after the destruction of the Hometree or the fighting montage in slow motion when Tsu'tey and other characters get struck down). However, there are a few instances, especially the mass scenes at the tree of souls, where the music completely fails and even took me out of the whole movie experience back into the real world for a moment because it did annoy me that much. When the Na'vi are gathered around the tree of souls praying it sounds more like a spiritual hippie happening than desperate and displaced indigenous people praying for help. Likewise the music used for both \"transfer\" scenes when the Na'vi are trying to transfer the human souls of Grace and Jake into their avatar bodies didn't help at all and made the scenes rather feel kitschy.]\n",

disappointed with this film. I should have known by the way people talked about the \"looks\" instead of the plot. Imagine this film without CGI and it probably would be just another Saturday morning cartoon. If they had to use old-school costumes and make-up this thing would have fallen flat.The target audience seemed to be the kids who watch Saturday morning cartoons. The story line would only challenge the brain of a 6 year old.But let's cut straight to the heart of the matter: the CGI. OK, so the computer can create some neat images. Got it. But I find beauty more in the Discovery channel's \"Life\" and \"Planet Earth\" then in this movie. For example, the characters walk like those in Sim Life - jerky. The characters were nowhere close to the \"alive\" imagery of Toy Story.The beasts with the thick-skin were just another mutant thing and the \"horses\" were blocky and weak. The flying birds were the only exception to nice flow and appearance in my eye.And consider the way the final fight scene showed a robot (think Iron Man) that moved better than a human being can...all by a joystick. The thing weighs tons but moved like a ballerina. Please! When it reached above its head to grab the main character I started laughing...don't tell me the thing has eyes on the top of its head or a brain to operate it. Sad.Scene after scene was met with a furrowed brow. We have Weaver's avatar looking like a poorly animated Tomb Raider. We have Weaver wrapped in green vegetation (when, how and why left unanswered). We have futuristic helicopters (sort of) but old-school wheelchairs.We have a smelly alien somehow getting in good with the planet's inhabitants. And not just fitting in, but moving up the ranks to one of the top leadership position.We have a red bird (the rest are green-blue) that didn't pick him, broke the rule of \"only one bird\" and I'm not sure that was enough to convince the people that this fainting stranger could now lead 2,000 to victory.We have sleep pods that have a big red button on them, but in the future we obviously can't shut them down any other way. We have helicopters that can leave a military installation (with big doors) without resistance and without any pursuit.We have a big tree as the home that is destroyed and THEN we discover other clans exist and don't live in trees. Do they hook up their ponytails to the water, grass, or clouds? The race comes across as passive since they sat around and waited to be over-ran, yet every scene of the daughter's suitor indicated warriors. At the beginning they were feared for their size and poisoned arrows, but by the end the wooden sticks were laughed at. Which is it? Seriously, this was a cartoon. And had I sat down one Saturday morning to watch it with my nephews I would have wondered when it was going to end. Yuck., Rarely have I seen a more nauseatingly bad movie than James Cameron's Titanic. It lingers within your stomach like a bad oyster, but longer. On the other hand, Avatar lingers with you like a good movie should, leaving a deep impression on your spirit.The CGI are used effectively and enjoyably, but most importantly, in a way that enhances the story, and not just for the sake of sensationalism.However, it is worth asking how good this movie would be without CGI? The script is good but not great, the acting good but not great. So it would probably rate a 6. What you have, in essence, is a Western, a cowboys and Indians type story, but with the Indians as the good guys, much like Dances with Wolves. It is these black and white characterizations that are the weakness of Avatar.But the CGI, alone, rates a solid 10. The effects in the movie are impeccable. One review claimed the 3D disappeared at points, but I think that was probably due to theater equipment malfunction.Some guests on NPR tried to accuse the movie of racism, with the blue people as stand ins for Blacks. Huh? That's absurd. Too bad the host had not seen the movie. The bad guys, mainly the general and the corporate flunky, are white. If only they had been portrayed with at least a slightly troubled conscience they would have had more believability.Fortunately, the movie does have characters whose consciences bother them, so it doesn't turn into a comic book, like Titanic. There is character development in both the humans and those blue people, the Navi. There is also a sufficiently complex plot to save it from the level of Titanic. And then there is Sigourney Weaver, a fine actress, who gives the otherwise schmaltzy movie bite.From what I have heard of the technical complexity of making this movie, the actors deserve credit for doing such a good job in the face of such artificial conditions. I couldn't have done it. These are not big names, yet they generally did solid work.One thing this movie has in common with Titanic is the way over the top gushing from many reviewers, too many. Frankly, there must have been a significant amount of paid buzz surrounding Titanic, and I think we are seeing it again with Avatar. This is standard PR operating procedure, going back at least to the Beatles, who had PR people who paid teenage girls to faint whenever they heard them play, to be taken to ambulances also on the PR payroll. (And then there are online reviewers who seem to hate Cameron with a vengeance.)When Titanic was finally released, I think the press reviewers felt pressured not to pan such an expensive, pre-hyped movie. In retrospect, the reviewers were too kind to that turkey. But this time, I think they are actually a bit too critical, perhaps to make up for Titanic, and perhaps knowing a critical review will do little damage at the box office. While Avatar will never be listed alongside of Casablanca or Citizen Kane for its script, it will be a movie that will be remembered and watched for years to come.So, bottom line, this is a movie you MUST watch in a movie theater because of the 3D, so go when you can see it in a theater with really good equipment. (Not all showings are in 3D, though. I don't think it is worth bothering seeing in 2D.), Years ago when Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was released (2001), it set a benchmark for rendered animated actors in a movie. I remember reading about the hundreds of hours of rendering time it took to make and was in awe of the animation. Man have we come a long way! Thanks to Moore's law, computing power has nearly tripled since then and the complexity of animation that's capable now blurs the line between CG and live-action & effects. Cameron has reportedly spent MILLIONS of $ on this movie and it shows in every aspect of the movie. Cameron is a master at telling a story and what I HATE in a lot of movies using live action and animated/CG characters is certainly absent from this movie. I SO hate it when some CG monster pops out at the actors and it HAS to roar (or do some OTHER formulaic action that's been miserably repeated ad nauseum in other movies) and stands there for a few seconds looking menacing and THEN it attacks our main character(s). I think Cameron must have did some homework and observations in nature to see how animals and such respond to threats and aggress in the wild. That part I feel he got pretty bang on and you CAN feel hair rise up on your skin and some semblance of what the character would probably be feeling. One example is when Jake accompanies the two scientist as a guard and is chased by some kind of creature. You can literally feel the panic, the branches banging on the characters face, and the wind as the creature takes swipes at him. I also like that the character's CG looked about 95% lifelike and not hyper-rendered or ultra-fluid. We CAN see the state-of-the-art in Avatar. The CG animation is ALMOST 100% like-like. Better than anything we've seen to date. When you encounter an animated actor in other movies, you can tell right away they are animated as they just don't have that certain human gait to their mannerisms and expressions. Cameron has pulled an ace out of the hat with the CG in that respect. I would guess a LOT of characters in the movie had some kind of motion-capture applied to them as they appeared vastly more realistic to what we recognize as motion and expression in the natural world. OK, on to the story and other elements.I can see some of the elements of what people say with regard to Last Samurai and Dances With Wolves BUT this is not THAT kind of movie. If you don't want to know TOO much of the movie, skip this part NOW! We learn that humans have pretty much plundered and rendered their own world sans \"green\" and have traveled 6 years (light years?) to a planet called Pandora because it has this stuff called Unobtainium (probably because it's unobtainable on earth, could have had a better name but I \"get\" why it's called that, slight allusion there) that goes for 20 million an ounce (or some such measure of weight) and the aliens are sitting on a mother-load of it. The human have been trying to court the aliens to swindle them...I mean, relocate them so they can dig up the Unobtanium. That's as much as you'll need to know in terms of premise of the movie. So with that, you can see the allusion to the \"white man\" coming in and taking away the Native American's land for a few baubles and beans. I think it was Cameron's intent to liken the aliens to Native Americans as it gives the story a bit of accessibility and digs into our collective past and how we treated the Native American's when \"we\" arrived. What it boils down to is Cameron saying to his audience that we as humans need to do a much better job of taking care of what we HAVE rather than progressing towards being a people who take from others and will ignorantly kill anything and anyone just to get what we THINK is ours.Overall, I don't agree with others saying this is the Star Wars of this generation. I thought the story was worthy of Cameron's name and his production and direction of this movie will not be rivaled ANY time soon. You will not notice the 2 1/2 hours length of the movie. Yes, it is THAT good. I look forward to watching it on BluRay or in 3D to see what I am really missing. If you walk away from this movie thinking \"stupid CGI, pro-alien, and anti-human\", you missed the whole point of the movie. BUT, if you walk away thinking that even if we ever live long enough or advance far enough to explore other worlds, we should always remember that if there is life already on another planet, it was there, long, long, LONG ago before we showed up.]\n"
