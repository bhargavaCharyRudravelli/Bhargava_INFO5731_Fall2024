0,"I had the rather intense privilege to view James Cameron's much anticipated $400 million budget return to the directing scene, Avatar, at the Empire Leicester Square in London.Where to begin! The visuals in this pieces was groundbreaking. He did it with the Terminator series and then Titanic, so one would expect Cameron to deliver... and HE DID! The visual are by far some of the sharpest CGI I have seen. You could almost say that there is a disquiet that follows Cameron's soul, as there is no other possibility of this strong and intensified quality. Its production design and visual effects are both noteworthy and it will get its praise upon official release.What it was lacking that really should have shaped the movie is its character/story. I was expecting a complex and believable plot, but was left with a movie with mostly strong visuals. What most sci-fi lovers desire is mind-bending philosophies, fantasy and exploration and limitations of our or outer species. If it was not for this factor, I would give this a 9.5 vote.Avatar will be a success, not only because of Cameron's legacy, but by very intelligent and viral marketing. Avatar have had a powerful marketing technique that assembles other successful blockbusters, such as The Blair Witch project (you all remember it), The Dark Knight (Joker invades the world) and also, the current production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) that is intelligently targeting the market.Kudos to Cameron, Avatar is one of the (if not The) movie of the year. I could get in trouble for sharing this with you guys so early, so please click Yes on ""Was the above comment useful to you?"" as a thank you. ;)",positive
1,"Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back.",positive
2,"You know the feeling when you start watching a movie, realizing it's almost 3 hours, and saying to yourself - ""Well this is probably gonna be mostly boring"", well, the creators of this movie didn't let that happen, rest assures.From the beginning up until the ending, every scene is perfected, with amazing acting, stunning directing, great visual effects, and astounding sound effects.The story building is just great , characters are well-developed , and the concept is brilliant.The only thing that's missing to me, is a fitting-soundtrack which could've give some scenes a great boost.I avoided watching this movie for a long time, because it just seemed a little ridiculous to me (Come on there are blue people) but I'm so glad I finally decides to give it a chance, and boy did it serve.Loved it. 9.5/10.",positive
3,"I'm not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash 'Avatar'. I know it wasn't when it came out, because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn't get enough of it. In hindsight, I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it; somehow, once the film had become the most successful movie ever (unadjusted for inflation) it stopped being cool to like James Cameron's eco-sci-fi extravaganza.Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story, unoriginal ideas and bland characters, as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados. ""FernGully in space"" or ""Dances With Wolves with blue cat-people"" are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure - which in all honesty I don't get.I mean, it's fine not to like the movie (all art is subjective and all that), but how so many self-professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture - which on Metacritic is rated even higher than 'The Dark Knight' - was nothing but a bland, unoriginal, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the (then) novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me.What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original, director-driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at 'Avatar': an original, director-driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties. ""The ideas in the film are not original"", they claim. Come on guys, seriously?So you've seen a world like Pandora before? A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests? A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness? You've seen many films about a bio-database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors?You've watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco-system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs? And by the way: how many ""eco-sci-fi"" films have you seen? Such a worn-out concept and tired old sub-genre, right?No my friends, in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come, and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons (like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information). But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight-forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci-fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience.To that end, the film uses certain well-known story tropes (""the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy""; ""the soldier who realizes he's been fighting for the wrong cause""; ""the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he's invading"" or the timeless trope of ""the fish out of water""), but they are not what the film is about. And those tropes are not copied from 'Dances With Wolves' either - any more than that film stole them from 'Pocahontas': they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history, from 'Lawrence of Arabia' to 'Shogun' or 'The Last Samurai' and countless others.And yes, our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters (though neither are they as bland as the film's most vicious detractors claim), but that's because they aren't really the film's main focus. 'Avatar's actual protagonist, its true star if you will, is Pandora. It's the WORLD we get to experience through Jake's eyes that really matters here, and the film aims straight for your gut - not your sci-fi nerd brain (which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans - now - claim to be disappointed with the film).More than anything, 'Avatar' wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand-in for our own threatened world, and the film is an unapologetic, uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature - as well as a call to action to preserve them. Which on an emotional level works marvelously: nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree, which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon. It's a genius scene, and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of ""Home Tree"" does in Cameron's film.So again (I'm trying to hammer my point home here ;-), 'Avatar' is simple? Yes, but that's the point: the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate; the themes are not just derivative re-treads, they're as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone. And that's exactly what Cameron's intention was: to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart-felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world. Which, given the film's success, it obviously did.Personally, I think 'Avatar' is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right, and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness. And while this may only have been my own individual experience, 'Avatar' was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater - which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D. It was also the last time a film managed to do that.And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular. It's a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top-notch CGI, filled with fascinating creatures and jaw-dropping future-tech, and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out, non-stop sci-fi action thrill-ride on a scale the world had rarely - if ever - seen before.Obviously that doesn't mean it's a perfect film, and as I already pointed out, it's fair not to like it for any number of reasons (above all: personal taste), but 'Avatar' is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days. Get over it people: simple doesn't equal simplistic, and the fact that 'Avatar' is neither subtle nor cynical doesn't make it dumb (even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed ;-).In all honesty, I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film - instead of the most successful movie of all time - many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci-fi adventure classic for the ages. And as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what 'Avatar' is: a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur. Rant over.",neutral
4,"I was waiting for this day for the longest time. I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released. So never got to watch it back then. But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away! This is nothing short of a masterpiece! It's beyond belief how a film like this could've been made. Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget. I'm definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough.Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art!",positive
5,"I was lucky to see Avatar at a pre-screening a few hours ago. It completely blew me and the whole room away and i dare to say it will do so to 80% of any audience anywhere. The remaining 20%, who always finds something to complain about, will whine about character development, dialog, story or the pop-corn.Well, let me tell you: they went to this movie with the wrong expectations.You have most likely met Cameron's previous work(s): Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic (!), just to name a few.So WHAT should you expect from Avatar??? MORE of the same!!! More of revolutionary film-making, more of grandiose new ideas, more of never-before-seen special effects, more of 150 minutes without relapsing, more of the James Cameron genius...I am very happy that the trailers didn't give the full story away. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also. Cameron was very smart keeping the teasers as teasers, nothing more... as the full movie will take your breath away.You will practically not notice that you are watching a non-existing world, it is sooo real. Attention to detail is superb. You computer geeks will know what I am talking about. This move was not rushed in the making. No wonder it could not have been done before - not having the proper computing power.The wild life, the jungle, the animals, the Na'vi-s, or the dragon-like flying creatures are all so life-like, they almost pop-off the screen (and in 3D they actually do :) .The sound effects were so well done, that when I saw at the credits that Skywalker Sound was behind it, i could only think of ""yessss... now THAT makes sense.""Cameron is a visionaire - and again, he delivers, with full blast.A certain character says in the movie that Pandora (the planet where the story takes place) became his real world. My advice to you: let Pandora become YOUR real world for two and a half hours, let it make you completely forget about your life and problems, let it entertain you, move you, let it carry you away.Because THAT is what i expect as an exchange for my ticket.And a few hours ago i got tens of tickets worth of that.",positive
6,"I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",positive
7,"First of all, let me get it out of the way: yes, Avatar is visually stunning. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good movie; alas, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do not make a good movie.Let's start with the picture. As I said before, the special effects and computer animation are really good; the textures feel very real, and the degrees of liberty that CGI animation allows in terms of camera angles and movement is well used for dramatic effects. The luxurious vegetation of the forest and the CGI-animated wild animals are a treat to the eyes. In terms of artwork, there is a definite influence from Nausicaa (the forest-world, the spores) and Starcraft (the vessels, the goliaths). I saw the movie in an IMAX movie with 3D glasses, but I am not convinced that they used the full potential of it - quite honestly, the Haribo commercial before the movie made a better use of it. I find it more strenuous to watch a movie with the 3D-glasses - some details are blurry, and it feels likewise when the camera makes swift lateral movements.Now, the scenario - the movie disappoints in that area. The plot is very Manichean, and it feels like a remake of Pocahontas, interspersed with elements from / tributes to Star Wars (Pandora and the Na'vi look like Endor and the Ewoks respectively), Nausicaa (the forest as an entity, the destructive impact of civilization on nature, the spores in the forest), Starcraft (Colonel Quarritch and Dr Augustine bear some resemblance with Arcturus Mensk and Sarah Kerrigan), Matrix (the concept of controlling another image of self), and maybe even Independence Day (the pilot fighter suicide) and the Lion King (the father's death, ""go, and never come back!"", ... am I going to far here?). But I can honestly say that I haven't been surprised at any point in the movie. You know from the beginning that he will be accepted by the Na'vi, that he will fall in love, that he will defect, that he will ultimately prevail after suffering some heavy casualties, and that he will find a way to permanently transfer his mind into the body of his avatar.It would have been interesting if the movie had dealt in more depth with the issues related to transferring one's mind into another body for instance, maybe a la Twelve Monkeys Army, where the ""hero"" is clearly deeply affected by experiences that the mind is not used to deal with (time travel in that case, but it is not that different from what we have here). Likewise, the love interest of our hero seems very indifferent to the fact that he really is a human remotely controlling a human - Na'vi bastard. I was expecting someone (him, her, or even one of the other humans in the scientific group) to show at least some kind of surprise / doubt when these feelings emerge. I was expecting more complexity in the social interactions of the characters, and their personality.I also take issues with some big stereotypes: corporations and the white men are greedy, indigenous people are pure, brave, and connected to the earth, but dumb - thankfully there is a human to teach them how to fight those who come from the sky. To some extent, the movie feels like a remake of the colonization of the Americas; just replace the Na'vis by native Americans, the aircrafts by ships, and modern weapons by muskets, and you have it. Except of course the colonization of the Americas did not have such a happy ending for the native tribes.On the whole, the movie is beautiful, but it feels like the main goal was to showcase fancy special effects. The movie would have benefited from more detailed characters, and a less linear and predictable plot. My rating is 6/10.",neutral
8,"Twelve years later, Titanic creator James Cameron yet again delivers a great science fiction extravaganza with the usual tropes and clichés of a ""good guy"" who must overcome a battle with his own morals to do what's right, but somehow making it all work beautifully. The characters, the musical score for every scene, the beauty and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of Pandora, living forests, thundering waterfalls, nimble beasts, flying dragon-birds, and the way cultures of the Na'vis is portrayed will truly keep you captivated and leave you beyond impressed.In its initial release, Avatar garnered mass positive reviews and went on to break multiple box office records in various markets. Worldwide, it became the highest-grossing movie of all time and bagged multiple awards in its genre including The Oscars. The story follows a paraplegic Marine who replaces his deceased twin brother to the distant moon Pandora on a unique mission but soon finds himself struggling between following orders and protecting a world he feels is his home. His aim; to persuade the mystic, nature-loving Na'vis to clear way for humans to mine their home and obtain a valuable mineral unobtainium; however, things take a turn when he falls in love with the Na'vi princess, Neytiri, and is eventually drawn into a battle with his own race for the survival of her world. As the planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora which is one if not the main focus of the film. With science fiction, the film also displays a series of unexplained phenomena that could not otherwise be explained by logic but relates to a more spiritual and imaginary level keeping in sync with the entire mystical setting of the storyline. The action sequences look phenomenal and you can definitely feel the scale of the two races fighting each other through Cameron's direction.While the majority agree that ""Avatar"" uses its sci-fi plot as a metaphor to give voice to our fears of the future and setting a great example of showing how we will fail in our efforts to eventually create a world full of destruction, some argue that it supports racist theme of a white hero yet again saving the primitive natives. The film also has connotations pointing to mass genocide, to the conflicts in countries like Iran and Vietnam, and to ecological situations like deforestation. However, I believe to view it from the perspective of a film that pits greedy, immoral humans against noble inhabitants and follows a message that all living is connected, and those who intend to exploit nature rather than respect it will only destroy themselves. This becomes evident when all the animals hostile to Pandora come together to charge at the humans to defend their land and their existence. The Ikran (flying birds) attack the aircrafts while the forest animals fight the soldiers on the ground. Neytiri can be heard yelling ""Jake, Eywa heard you!"" insinuating that mother nature recognized the importance of defending itself.After its release, Avatar became an extremely controversial movie, with some people claiming it to be groundbreaking while others calling it an overlong and derivative bore. The warranted hate, in my opinion, comes from the fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies that stress on the overproduced heroic factor, however, it is evident that Cameron has poured his heart and soul into this masterpiece, breaking through the motion-capture tech frontier with state of the art CGI. So even if the movie doesn't exactly consist of the biggest twists and turns, it surely sets out to stun us with the enchanting VFX that made the whole mystical world convincing and life-like, working in favor of a classic, albeit overused, storyline.In conclusion, Avatar is about a race of humanoids that could not be more alien from us, and yet, by about half way through the film, it manages to completely convince us of their realism, their plight and their humanity. It also demonstrated in harsh terms our audacity to be merciless and barbaric to those who appear different from us. This movie did what it set out to do perfectly and maybe even better, and towards the end, it will get you wondering about all the possibilities of life existing in the depths of the universe out there. Without much exaggeration, it is a cinematic experience of the generation, ahead of its time, that will leave you spellbound in the best way possible. So if you haven't seen Avatar, then you should see it as soon as possible- a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker!",positive
9,"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge James Cameron fan. I think ""Terminator"" is a masterpiece of sci-fi and the single best edited film of all time, ""Aliens"" is easily the best sequel not from the original director and I personally like it a lot more than the original. ""Abyss"" created an interesting world and was racked with tension, ""Terminator 2"" is an action tour-de-force and has what I believe the best sound editing/design of all time, ""True Lies"" is goofy fun, more poignant than most give it credit for with a boffo ending, and finally ""Titanic"" was far better than anyone expected it to be and has one of the most believable romances in a movie.So then there was the 12 year wait for ""Avatar"". No reviews, word of mouth, ticket price or natural disaster would keep me from the midnight IMAX 3D screening. I went with moderate expectations, which the film matched exactly. While this kept me from being disappointed it wasn't a good thing.Movie fans were on edge because if ""Avatar"" flops, it'll mean the death of creativity in a remake-happy Hollywood. That's a valid concern but the problem is nothing in ""Avatar"" is creative whatsoever. It is literally ""Dances with Wolves"" in space, right down to having a ""Wind in his Hair"" character as a foil to the ""new guy"".As the movie progressed it caused the worst of all bad reactions for me as a viewer - I started thinking about other things. Then I kept thinking ""well the end battle is supposed to be awesome"".SPOILER WARNING! (if for some reason you can't guess how this movie ends) End battle comes and the movie switches from being ""Dances with Wolves"" to Disney's ""Atlantis"" (but that's unfair since both of those movies contained far, FAR better musical scores) Gunship windows that were impervious to arrows a few scenes ago (to show Na'vi desperation) suddenly become brittle and break easily (to show Na'vi heroism). The battle isn't nearly as long as you'd expect, and nowhere near as epic / engaging as the finale of Return of the King. Finally there's a Robo-suit vs Navi fight and it is admittedly pretty good. Unlike 95% of directors these days Cameron knows enough to pull the camera back and let us SEE the fight. However it's an odd choice to spend millions on 10 foot tall ""creatures"" and then rarely even have them in the same frame as humans.And of course there's the obligatory scene where characters are dying in slow motion as Middle Eastern vocal music plays (see Gladiator or Munich) Wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't said to my friend on the way there ""How much you wanna bet there's a part where characters die in slow motion over Middle Eastern music?""As with most movies these days ""Avatar"" is far too long, glossing over important details (why is Earth dying, what does Unobtainium do, etc) and instead spending time on flight scenes, mystic ceremonies, spirit trees and nature bonding.Ultimately I just did not care. Since the dawn of cinema Hollywood recycles old ideas every few decades and slaps on a bigger budget / new stars / better effects so you won't notice. I can see re-doing ""Ben Hur"" with color and sound, but why do we need ""Dances with Wolves"" with 20 times the budget and blue Native Americans? No amount of impressive visuals, robo-suits, gunship battles, perfect character CGI or Sigorney Weaver can change the fact that I've seen this movie 100 times before. I could even accept the weak story if there were any characters to give a rat's ass about. This film is also dreadfully humorless, a stark contrast to ""Titanic"" where humor was one of its many surprises.Regarding 3D... I've seen many films in it now and honestly you don't even notice after the few minutes. It doesn't make the money any better or worse, just more expensive.Citizen Kane, The Robe, Sound of Music, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Toy Story, The Matrix... these movies changed movies. We can say that looking back now. ""Avatar"" saying it would ahead of time is pure hubris, ""unsinkable Titanic""-like poppycock.But if expensive motion-capture being used to cover up a weak, generic story is the future of cinema then count me out, I'll stick with my PS3.",neutral
10,"Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***½/****",positive
11,"I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as ""Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichéd, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox",neutral
12,"Well, I just saw Avatar this morning, one of the press premieres which are running on these days. My opinion: you've seen this story a hundred times, but never like this. Finally 3D is what it's supposed to be, an instrument at the service of the movie. You'll enjoy the visual experience, no doubt.As for the story, some of the ""inspirations"" are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I'm not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you're 15 or so, you'll have a great time thinking that it's the first time somebody makes something like this. If you're an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clichés.I liked it, however: ""the movie that re-invents movies""??? No way.",neutral
13,"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10",positive
14,"It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity – a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake's (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience – not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D – which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG – something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek's Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back!",positive
15,Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I've never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That's why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don't miss this one on the big screen if you haven't seen it. It's a total new world experience. Can't wait for the PART 2....,positive
16,"I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local ""Event Cinema"" BCC in 3DNow this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi's faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...So for those of you who have not seen this yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!5/5",positive
17,"""Avatar"" is not the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings."" It might be the next ""Matrix,"" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next ""Matrix Revolutions."" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after ""Return of the King."" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the ""Na'vi,"" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Heck, even ""Dead Man."" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, ""we have to fight terror with terror."" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about ""Star Wars"" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember ""Jake Sully."" 6/10",neutral
18,"When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it's industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it's audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it's an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90's, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the ""Avatar Program"", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70's, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40's - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it's time.4 Stars out of 4 Stars",positive
19,"Yeah this movie took several steps forward in terms of cinematography and filming technology, but that is all that can really be said to be what makes this film worth seeing. Everything else that makes a film great is totally lack luster.There is no deep character development. Why does Jake Sully really want to become a part of the Navi? What was life on Earth like? What really makes him want to break away from his roots there? Is it just the ability to walk? I mean are there no more Native Americans or Buddhists left on Earth (which is clearly who the Navi were based off of) to give him that spiritual satisfaction? How does he feel about filling his brother's shoes? Twin relationship? The conflict between scientists and the military is not developed. Every supporting character was a stock character. Michelle Rodriguez somehow manages to have a place in Hollywood after literally playing the same type of character in every film she is in (Fast and the Furious, SWAT, Blue Crush...yeah just put her in a futuristic helicopter and thats her in this one). Was Sigourney Weaver supposed to be a mother figure? How did the bad guy from the Last of the Mohicans feel about faking a Native American language? The plot was totally predictable, and the dialogue was crap. It was like James Cameron turned in his dialogue assignment a day late.This movie deserves no award nominations at all outside of those in technical categories.",neutral
20,"Just go! The people who made this movie, most of which are just average working people making a normal salary deserve it for what they have created. This movie accomplishes what most people go to movies for. To escape from reality for a little while.Not only is this what I consider a milestone in the evolution of state of the art movie making, it's a good story with a simple message.A bit annoyed at some of the criticisms. I don't see anything political in the metaphorical message this movie presents. If Republicans hate the idea that getting close to nature is good and war is bad then too bad so sad for them! There is only 1 directly political reference to Bush. That is when the military offensive is referred to as a ""shock and awe"" campaign. If people are going to get their panties in a bunch over that then again, sucks to be them! Also don't understand the criticisms about the similarity to Dances with Wolves. Dances with Wolves was not a unique idea. Modern society has been screwing over aboriginals for centuries. What is so bad in pointing that out once in awhile in a way that most people can relate to? By seeing it through the eyes of someone from this modern world.I loved every minute of this movie. There were a couple tiny teeny little things in the dialog I would have done differently but no matter how you slice it, this is a masterpiece!",positive
21,"I realize I am probably going to get flames galore for this comment, and you all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey, I'm entitled to my opinion too. Avatar is grade A crap. That's right, it's crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question: If it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the trees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in Matrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that Star Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough compelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don't know... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has NOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference between Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. The worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say that the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is this: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's it. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done. Still, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge let-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense.",negative
22,"Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me – particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first ""big"" film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The ""look it's in 3D"" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about ""how did they do that shot"" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as ""Unobtainium"" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is ""so-so"", Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these.",neutral
23,"James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. He is what you may call an Auteur. If you aren't aware of this, then you probably are not a movie person. James Cameron wrote and directed Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic. That last one I'm not a fan of, but he won Best Director, Picture, and it became the highest grossing film of all time. $1.2 billion dollars.Avatar is his latest film, it is a movie that has been in the works since 1994. After a decade of being in the works, you would expect it to be a good movie. But the real question is it any good? It is the most expensive film ever made. The budget was $500,000,000 so you'll be wondering if all that money was put to good use, and if you should spend $11.00 to see the film in 3-D. Should you or should you not?The answer is that you should. Avatar is a monumental success. It is a film unlike anything you have ever seen. It uses special effects to a level that you have never seen, and that's not a bad thing.The story to Avatar revolves around Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who is sent unwillingly to a hostile planet known as Pandora. While on this planet he finds himself caught in the middle of a war between the planet's indigenous people known as the Na'vi, and his own race. He must decide whether he should fight for what he knows is right or help his own people destroy Pandora as they destroyed earth. I don't want to spoil anything in the story, so I'll refrain from saying anything else. To put it simple, the whole movie was the prime example of a colonialism work.The cast in Avatar is strong. Sam Worthington (Terminator: Salvation) stars as Jake Sully. He does a fantastic job, but the real credit in the film has to go to Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) for playing the native Neytiri. She creates most of the emotion in the entire film. She preforms fantastically and I also have to mention that she is also really attractive as a blue woman. (True fact.) Some people have complained about Stephen Lang (Public Enemies) as the antagonist of the film. But he actually pulls off a very believable and cruel performance. All the actors in the film are great. But the real actors are the ones that are the digital Na'vi. These actors are the ones that create the film. I think that this movie is proof that special effects don't have to be of just robots killing and blowing stuff up. (Even though that's in this movie.) This movie shows that special effects can be used to take us to places that we never even dreamed of.Other films have used special effects like this. (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean, District 9) But none of them have gone as far as this movie has. This movie takes you to a whole new level of film making that you can't even imagine. You almost want to call this movie insane, because of how different and unique it is. You really have never seen anything like this, and that's a very good thing. What I really enjoyed about this film, was how it is a breath of fresh air. You don't see that very often. The only other films to do that this year for me were District 9 and Fantastic Mr. Fox. But Avatar is far more different and unique than these other movies.One thing that I always enjoy about a James Cameron film is his sense of innovation. Avatar is the most innovative movie I've seen in years. It is so different from anything else that you have seen. It is a movie a film that you literally cannot describe. This is a see to believe film. You'll have to see the movie to believe that it's as good as I'm telling you. Avatar is a once in a lifetime film. You will not get another chance to see a movie like this one.James Cameron creates not only a visually beautiful race of people, but also a culture that is so beautiful. The Na'vi in Avatar felt very Native American to me. Everything from how they dress to the musical score is very unique, and made me think of Native Americans. The film was almost like a reenactment of our history, with the Native Americans being driven out of their home land. It's all very believable. It's all very sad as well; and it moves you. I sympathize with the Na'vi as they fight for their lives and their home.I am not a fan of 3D. I think it is over used, and ultimately lessens the movie experience. Avatar however, is not like that. The 3D in Avatar is extraordinary. Little bugs on the screen fly right past you, leaves fall from trees towards you, and the battles are astronomical. You really feel like you're there, and forget that this is a movie. The cinematography is actually enhanced by the 3D which is a rare thing. The wide flying camera shots make you feel like you're flying with the film, it is fantastic.Avatar is a difficult movie to review because it is so innovative. It blows away almost all sci-fi epics out there, and is a must see. See Avatar. It is well worth full-price, and it is the best picture of the year. The only movie that comes to being as good as Avatar is District 9. Avatar however, I will say is better because Avatar has heart. A truly fantastic movie. Avatar is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, it is James Cameron's masterpiece, and it should not be missed.",positive
24,"This movie actually blew my mind! I have to admit that it's quite easy to impress me, but when i left the cinema I was just amazed by the feelings this film left. First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think. The Sorrounding on ""Pandora"" doesn't let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. This is no ""switch off your brain""-movie!!!In my opinion this film is worth 9-10 stars, I'm giving 10 for the goose-flesh it still gives me every time I see the trailer or hear the soundtrack. This evening I'm gonna watch it again :-)PS: Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Germany...",positive

But i will go see it for the 3rd time this week, in Imax 3-D.The emotions displayed on the characters faces were incredibly detailed, especially Neytiri. It all looked so real. If i didn't know better, i would of said that they just went to a distant planet and filmed aliens. It looked so real... This was probably the first movie that i actually was disappointed that it ended. i really wanted it to never end. The flying scenes were incredible, and the scenes when the humans interact with the Na'Vi were flawless.",positive
26,"I'm not sure where to begin with James Cameron's Avatar. I could start by saying I've been waiting 12 years for this film. I could start by saying Terminator 2 is my all time favorite movie, and I've watched it a thousand times since I was a kid. But I'm going to start with the most positive thing I could say. James Cameron is a special filmmaker. He revolutionized film-making in the 1980s with The Terminator and Aliens. He did it again in the 1990s with Terminator 2 and Titanic. So after 12 years of anticipation and hype, and all the reports of the record budget being somewhere between a mind-boggling $300 and $500 million, I expected Avatar to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.And sadly, it wasn't. Not even close. I will admit that the visuals in the film were stunning, and sometimes made you feel like you were dreaming. Cameron has definitely spent his time wisely creating a new universe all his own, and inventing a totally new world, one that leaves us in awe. However, for a filmmaker like Cameron, the whole IMAX 3D element of the film really wore on me. After a while, I couldn't wait to take off those uncomfortable glasses which helps us ""see"" the stunning visuals, as Cameron wants us to, which are quite nauseating, particularly for a movie that is almost three hours in length. I've never seen a film in 3D or IMAX before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But now that I've seen it, it begs the question, why? Hey Jimmy, you're James frickin' Cameron! You don't need 3D to make good movies, man! I feel like 3D is like cheating on a test that you've studied for your entire life. Why is Cameron trying to overcompensate for no reason? He can make superb films without any of this IMAX 3D CGI stuff.As for the plot, well there is none. Avatar essentially features no plot, or story, other than the typical love angle, which can only be classified as being beyond cheesy. If there is a ""story"", you've seen and heard it many times before. A man sent in to infiltrate a band of aliens grows close to their ways and in the end turns against his own kind when the two sides battle each other out. You've seen it in Dances With Wolves, you've seen it in The Last Samurai, hell, I could even go all the way back to 1956 and cite John Ford's The Searchers as a movie which features characters who are pulled into another society or world only to become one of them. Now, before you go and crucify me and say ""well every movie can be traced back to something else"", which is true, you need to understand that James Cameron is a trend-setter. HE is the one that makes the most refreshing movies, HE is the one that everyone else copies. HE doesn't need to copy anyone else. HE used to create films with creative plots and likable characters, but there's nobody to like in Avatar. After all, it's not easy to relate to a CGI-made 10 foot tall blue alien.I really expected more out of this film. The graphics were amazing, sometimes. Other times, it was just migraine-inducing. I wanted something to happen. And nothing really happened. Cameron could have made one of the all time great films if he had just put some more thought into it, and created a good story, with fleshed out characters, and a climax that doesn't come off as being a thoughtless, cookie-cutter finale. Armed with a budget of this enormity, and over a decade between narrative films, you'd think ""the king of the world"" would have come up with a better movie.But I do think people will love most of the visuals, I certainly did. But after nearly three hours, it suddenly dawns on you, ""is there anything else to this movie?"" Because while staring at the Mona Lisa is a very thought provoking thing to do, eventually, you move on! And that's what this film felt like. A beautiful painting come to life, but one that eventually gets tired and predictable. Sadly, and despite what most of people will say, because they loved the visuals and have never seen anything like it, James Cameron's Avatar was extremely disappointing and I'm not sure if I'll ever forget this kind of disappointment for a long, long time.I still love Terminator 2, and I still love James Cameron. But I feel like I've been waiting through a 12 year war for my loved one to return, only to see them come back a completely different person, one whom I simply don't know and can't trust anymore. Take this for what it is, an honest review from ONE viewer. Most will not be in favor of my thoughts, because it's not overly positive. But it is what it is. Avatar is not exactly a movie. It is something else. A $400 million cartoon perhaps. Or a $400 million live-action video game. It will probably be copied a million times over the course of the upcoming decade though. Maybe, hopefully, by the end of it, Cameron will return to making movies with real people again. Maybe then, everyone will copy him once more, and all movies will go back to being about real people again. I think that's something that we all want deep down inside, but, for some reason... we just won't admit it.",neutral

28,"You put your glasses on and you're in. A feast for the eyes at least for the first hour. The brain, however, remains asleep. How strange that such an ambitious enterprise could ignore its most important aspect, the story. A rehash of other things with dialogues from a high school play. Also, very self referential. The bitch! from Aliens truly omnipresent. I was surprised Sam Worthington didn't say ""I think I've seen an iceberg"" or maybe he did say it while I conceded myself a little nap - after the second hour - So here we are, facing a film future in 3D"" I will, still, long for characters in movies, people I can, not just relate, but be inspired by, thought provoking and all the rest that goes with it. So, Cameron did it again and if money is at the center of the world, he remains ""king of the world""",positive
29,"It's been 12 years since we last saw James Cameron's visionary directing on the big screen. He previously graced Our Cinemas with the Likes of The Terminator, Aliens and the rather popular titanic. The latter went on to gross more than 1.8 billion dollars worldwide and bag 11 Oscar's. Now he's back with another epic, Avatar. It's been 12 years in the making, now it is being realised in glorious 3-D.The story is set hundreds of years from today on the distant moon of Pandora. The planets a lush, vivid place full of beautiful and deadly creatures. The population that inhabit this planet are the Na'vi, they are big, very fast and athletic with a knack for not taking the humans lightly. The film centres on Jake sully (Sam Worthington) a paraplegic marine who is offered a second chance at being a soldier. He is asked to fill in his recently deceased brother's boots and head to Pandora. The First thing you will notice about this film is that it looks incredible. Every single blade of grass has been fully detailed. The motion capture technology brings the Na'vi to life, with every emotion being realised. This is truly from a visionary point of view, a work of art.You are transported to the Moon of Pandora and it's a marvel if you are seeing it in 3-D, as intended. You are then introduced to the main characters of the film. First you meet the rather joyful and impressive colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) He gives a stand out performance as a stereotypical American Grunt, a rather over used clich√© by the Canadian director. You are then introduced to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) who has affection for the Na'vi, and looking for a way back into the indigenous population's community.You will notice through the film that there are many references to James Cameron's previous work Aliens. There are a few small similarities' and one big, Aliens is arguably Cameron's best work, so it's not a negative. The role of Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) will remind you of Carter Burke, the slimy all business Executive from Aliens. The score by James Horner, who also worked with Cameron on the 1986 hit leaves a familiar taste in your mouth. Cameron originally wanted Michael Biehn to play the role of Quaritch but thought the audience would get confused as Sigourney Weaver is also in the movie.The introduction of neytiri (Zoe Saldana) is powerful and exciting, You get the impression that she knows how to handle herself, This is a trait of all Jim Cameron's heroines. She introduces us to the Na'vi culture, and in the process, we start to care for and understand the advanced race.The film flows well; it can drag at times, especially in the middle act of the film. This could have been improved with an extra RDA encounter, to further mount the tension between the Na'vi and the inpatient humans. The Action in the film is amazing, real hard hitting stuff. But it is in no way mindless. Every scene of action has been carefully crafted, by the trusty hands and eyes of James Cameron, Who has a knack for getting the audiences, pulse racing. The final battle lasts around 40 minutes long and it is defiantly a sight to be seen.Final Thought's: On a technical level the film is a triumph with moments of wonder, the action is top notch to boot. The script and story can let it down at points, but that is no reason not to see the movie.Avatar is like a beautiful painting. What you see is what you get, and what you get is nothing short of epic.A moment of brilliance: The final battle scene is as good as they come. The last time you had Goosebumps like this, was when a well known farm boy, destroyed a death star.Reviewer: Joshua Roberts",positive
30,"It's movies like this that are a reminder that story should always be the number one priority when making a movie. The amount of clich√©s at multiple phases in the movie is unbelievable. It would be too easy to point out obvious and rather blatant rip offs that occur throughout (going into a misunderstood tribal group, sacred trees, being in tune with nature). After all I was almost shocked I didn't see the writers of the Disney version of Pocahontas credited as assistant writers.After saying this, I have to give credit where credit is due. James Cameron's vision for film making is unmatched by anyone. The visuals are outstanding; entertaining and saved me from regretting laying down the extra two dollars to see this film in 3-D (it's not worth it to see the regular version). It is obvious that Cameron has unparallel dedication and drive to make a film that people will want to see. This same dedication and drive made him want to handle writing this one himself. Few posses the power to demand the type of budget that Cameron can and it's obvious this film could not have been made without a substantial budget. If you would have combined this new ground breaking and visually stunning technology, with an equally moving and unique script then that's the movie I want to see.Am I disappointed I invested 162 minutes and $10.50 into this movie? No. The visual themselves are worth the price. But at points you will be nauseated, you will roll your eyes, and will ask the question: Why does Hollywood not think we can handle a good story anymore?",neutral
31,"I have never been so close to leave the movie theater, as i was when seeing Avatar. Sure, it's very beautiful to look at, but, if you've seen the trailer, then you've seen the movie! It's basically every movie clich√©s put together in one horrible and so unoriginal movie. it's a mix of the ""last samurai"" meets ""Pocahontas"" meets ""Atlantis""! it's by far the most horrible storyline since Ed Woods' ""plan 9 from outer space"".Not once are you surprised by the turn of events in this movie, and there's so many bad movie clich√©s in it, and so many things that just doesn't make any sense at all (even in their universe). for example, the last fight scene with the giant robot and the Avatar. It really doesn't make any sense at all, that the robot is carrying a 8-foot-1 hunting knife, just in case he loses his gun (which could easily have been attach to the robot!), and that the robot tells the avatar, what he's about to do, instead of just doing it (A good example of a bad clich√©).If you want to see this movie, i recommend you either see the trailer ( as that is enough for you, to litterily, call every scene in the movie) or you go out and buy Atlantis and just Imagine it with smurfs instead of underwater people.",negative
32,"As I'm writing this, the time is well passed 3 AM, and I don't feel tired at all. I'm on a high that comes from a compelling work of art ‚Äìthe kind of art that leaves a good taste in your mouth. The kind of art where you wake up in the morning and your breakfast tastes better. Yes, I'm on a high, and I may just be an addict, as I would love nothing more than to walk into another screening this very moment.About 12 years ago (about the time that Titanic hit theaters), legendary director James Cameron wrote down a science fiction story that he had, more or less, carried in his head since youth. What Cameron realized right off the bat was that his story, a classical amalgam of influences from My Lai and Wounded Knee to self actualization and the ""reborn"" nature of spirituality, could only achieve cinematic greatness in the manner of its execution, not in the uniqueness of its elements -much the same as Star Wars. What Cameron saw in his head was the important thing, and I'm happy to say that the special effects technology is finally able to catch up to his vision (and probably surpass it). James Cameron's Avatar is nothing short of the most splendid buffet of visuals that my eyes ever did feast upon in a science fiction film.Is the film perfect? Certainly not. There are a few instances of relatively stale dialogue, but never in a distracting way (I'm looking at you Hayden Christenson). Most of the dialogue isn't very quotable in a ""Star Wars"" way either, but then again, Star Wars never had the same level of elegant visual storytelling that Avatar does.Many reviewers have cited 1 dimensional characters: for this I must cry foul. Consistency does not equate to single dimensionality; it is true that most of the characters remain consistent in their moral drive for the duration of the film and most follow well-proved archetypal character journeys, but I fail to see why minimal moral ambiguity is a problem here if it wasn't for Star Wars, The Lion King, Lawrence of Arabia or It's A Wonderful Life. Regardless, the movie is about Sully, and I happen to think that Sully's character was developed in a rich way. It didn't feel ""samey"" to the culture crossover main characters in Last of the Mohicans, Last Samurai, or Dances with Wolves.As for the ""Dances with Wolves"" plot mold of indigenous folks vs. Western greed (the most common ""flaw"" mentioned at rottentomatoes.com), what with the film's ""mcguffin"", unobtainium: natural resources driving the narrative, the story more closely resembles Dune than anything else. And it's executed in such a way that it more fully realizes the story mold than nearly any previous effort; fantastical exaggeration of the symbiotic interdependency between the N'avi and their environment (which they share in a literal, biological way - beyond just food) creates a new benchmark of dramatic urgency in science fiction storytelling.Much of modern sci-fi boringly necessitates pessimism in its narrative to achieve ""respectable"" status, but Cameron beautifully strays from the pack on this outing. Hopeful, spiritual optimism through rich, epic cultural exploration mirrors that found in classics like The Lion King or Lawrence of Arabia. Horner's score emphasizes this as well.The 3D is stunning,never gimmicky, and simply must be seen in Imax.Perhaps when I see Avatar again, I won't like it as well as I do now. Perhaps I must first be sobered from my initial excitement of seeing something crazy and new before I can make an objective analysis worth reading¬Ö For the moment, I don't care. All I really need to say is: Everyone, see this movie. James Cameron, I see you.(Edit: Saw it again... Still awesome)",positive
33,"In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, heads the mining operation, which employs Marines for security, intending to exploit Pandora's reserves of a valuable mineral called unobtanium. Pandora's inhabitants are the Na'vi, a blue-skinned species of humanoids with feline characteristics. Physically stronger and taller than humans, the Na'vi live in harmony with nature, worshiping a mother goddess called Eywa.Pandora's atmosphere is toxic to humans, necessitating the use of breathing masks. Attempting to improve relations with the natives and learn about Pandora's biology, scientists grow Na'vi bodies modified with human DNA, called avatars, that are controlled by genetically matched, mentally linked human operators. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former marine, replaces his twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator, who was killed in a mugging. Doctor Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother and relegates him to a bodyguard role.In their avatar forms, Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) on a mission to reestablish peaceful relations with the Na'vi. A predator attacks the group and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by her clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at (C. C. H. Pounder), a shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior ""Dream-walker"", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways. Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), leader of the security forces, enlists Jake to bring him intelligence about the natives that could help RDA negotiate for access to the huge unobtanium deposit under Hometree. He promises Jake that he will help him obtain the expensive neuroregeneration treatment to restore his legs.At first, Jake delivers key strategic information to Quaritch. Augustine becomes suspicious and relocates herself, Jake, and Norm to a remote scientific outpost with an avatar link module. Over three months, Jake grows close to Neytiri and the Omaticaya, while questioning his loyalty to RDA's agenda. He is initiated into the Omaticaya, and he and Neytiri choose each other as mates. Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he disables a bulldozer as it destroys the tribe's ""Tree of Voices"". Quaritch presents Selfridge and Augustine with a video diary in which Jake admits that the Omaticaya will never abandon Hometree. Selfridge decides further attempts at negotiations are futile and orders Hometree destroyed.Augustine argues that the destruction of Hometree could affect the bio-botanical neural network that all Pandoran organisms are connected to, and Selfridge gives Jake and Augustine one hour to convince the Na'vi to leave Hometree. When Jake reveals his original mission to the Omaticaya, Neytiri accuses him of betraying them. Jake and Augustine's avatars are taken captive. Quaritch's forces arrive and destroy Hometree, killing Eytucan (Wes Studi), Neytiri's father and clan chief, and many others. Jake and Augustine are disconnected from their avatars and detained for treason along with Norm. Trudy Chac√≥n (Michelle Rodriguez), a security force pilot disgusted with Quaritch's senseless violence, breaks them out and flies them to the remote link module. During their escape, Quaritch shoots Augustine.Hoping the Omaticaya can help Augustine, Jake tames a Toruk, a powerful flying beast that only five Na'vi have ever tamed, to regain their trust. Jake finds the Omaticaya at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Augustine. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her dying body into her Na'vi avatar with the aid of the Tree, but she succumbs to her injuries before the transfer completes. Mo'at declares that ""she is with Eywa now"".With the assistance of Neytiri and Tsu'Tey (Laz Alonso), the new leader of the Omaticaya, Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other clans to repel the humans. Jake prays to Eywa, via neural connection to the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi in the coming battle. Quaritch notes the mobilization of Na'vi clans and convinces Selfridge to authorize a preemptive strike on the Tree of Souls. Because it is a center of Na'vi religion and culture, its destruction would leave the Na'vi too demoralized to resist further encroachment.As the security forces attack, the Na'vi retaliate but suffer heavy casualties, among them Tsu'Tey and Trudy. Suddenly, the Pandoran wildlife joins the attack on the corporation's forces, overwhelming them. Neytiri interprets this as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Jake destroys the main bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls. Quaritch stumbles across the avatar link module where Jake's human body is located and attacks it, exposing Jake to Pandora's atmosphere. Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake. With the attack repelled, Neytiri and Jake reaffirm their love as she sees his human body for the first time.Selfridge and the remaining corporate personnel are expelled from Pandora, while Jake, Norm, and the scientists studying Pandora are allowed to remain. Jake is seen wearing the insignia of the Omaticaya leader. The clan performs the ritual that permanently transfers Jake from his human body into his Na'vi avatar.Brilliant CGI, sound, & vividly showcased in vibrant colors!!! Everyone will cheer for one of the most exciting & innovative films of all time!!!",positive
34,"Simple as that :-) This movie is more than most of you think. It has the message. Cameron has certainly done his homework.Have you ever heard of Gaia theory - living spirit of the planet (so it is not some dead rock as some of you may think) Or what about the theory of the Akashi field? You have it here. If your soul is evolved sufficiently, you'll feel this movie.What i find absolutely brilliant are not just the spellbinding effects or the depths of the story but the SIMPLICITY that is ingenious.The most simple thing done in the right way can have the deepest effect on you and Cameron did that with this movie (and just the line ""I see you"" in the movie is a proof how brilliant and ingenious this movie is)A milestone of the movie-making - and the message for the grabbing hands among us",positive
35,"AVATAR has a soul I saw AVATAR today. It was a boiling 40 degrees Celsius in Australia. I caught a bus and train to get there. I spent months on a forum before that. Incremental stops included a scriptment, stills, a teaser, a foot, AVATAR day and a full trailer. Now released I have had many reviews to read which have been mostly very positive. It is a marvel to watch. The opening scenes are very sci-fi with a glimpse of low gravity aboard a space-craft. Sam Worthington fills us in with a short narration. He is taking over his diseased brother's role in the AVATAR program. These opening scenes are actually among the most effective 3D in the film, pulling you into this story, tracking shots putting you into the steps of the characters. I jump ahead, like the film, to The world of Pandora which is lush with earthly life as seen through pulp fantasies. The rendering of this world is terrific. The life and activity is in the plants as much as it is the animals. Wonder is generated with this ambitious creation. Cameron has lifted the bar. The CG is the best I have ever seen. Everything you have heard is true. The 3D enhances this with leaves falling and swaying branches life-like in the foreground. The realisation of the Navii is also ambitious. They are CG but there are many moments that make you think they are real and in terms of the story they are more than good enough to propel the narrative with strong emotional content. I went into this film knowing mostly everything within it. Hours of reading, some from the treatment and pages of the recent reviews. It is very much a family film like ""Nealz"" said in his IMDb review. There is a moment where one of the ferocious animal species that earlier were attacking Jake are seen with a litter, the children in the audience loved the cute pups! The spiritual side of this film is much better than expected. It is in fact a beautiful story. The structure is classical film-making but with amazingly new scope in CGI to express grand images. An epic The journey that Jake takes through Pandora is lovely. He is taken in by the Navii and explores their culture, language and habitat. Natirii, the female Navii he meets while lost, helps him through this journey. This is a love story of both soul mates and with a wider picture. Existential connections with the natural world. Personal destiny. I had tears in this film. I tried to hold them back but by the roll of credits they came. This is a movie that I have anticipated for so long. I think the ingredients of its story and my connection to this films production gave me a very emotional response. I cant imagine this disappointing any of the fans on the board. Keeping in mind that it is a family film but delivered everything I wanted. Expect a special edition. After AVATAR is a hit, a special edition will make its way to the cinema. I can understand why they would cut the earth scenes and it works. The actual film seems pretty brisk and it could also have more padding out. You want more of it and that is a triumph for this type of film running two and a half hours. It is a good balance because at two and a half hours AVATAR is aimed directly at the cinema going audience. Broadly appealing with elements for everyone. My earlier prediction of a billion or more world-wide seems safe. I don't want to go on about visuals too much but the lovely shots of the natural wonderland of glowing life in still 3D shots is magical. Something to take kids to see. Floating tiny neon life jellyfish their way through the air with grace. The monkey-like extra-limbed creatures with the peeping eyes flock through the forrest quickly. The creature design is done in a clever way with the motion of a living thing. The action is over the top, epic, frenetic and a new take on the battle sequence. James Cameron didn't stuff this up. He probably pressed the studio way beyond their comfort zone with the time, money and effort that has gone into this. Sam Worthington is excellent casting choice. Sigourney Weaver ads frank reason. Stephen Lang chews the scenery as the ultimate you know what. Zoe Saldana is beautiful as Jakes guide into this world and. I went to the cinema and it was a very hot day. By the time I left the cinema, the streets were wet with rain. A warm humidity was thick in the air. Lightning splashed my walk to the train station with white light. I honestly wondered if It was my time to be struck down with a bolt of electricity from the sky. Watch this film. It is destined to become a childhood classic to many little-ones too young to be on this forum. It will be talked about at high school by male and females as spectacular. It will be watched multiple times by fans. I loved it but beyond my appreciation for the film itself, is the the message of love permeating from this movie that I hope enters the zeitgeist like elements of Cameron's other stories have. At its heart is a soul. AVATAR is an achievement in many technical departments but I wouldn't say the story is deficient. It is a beautiful experience and the story is surprisingly what I loved most. Believe the hype.",positive
36,"James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying.",neutral
37,"welcome back, James Cameron, One thing is Sure Avatar will break previous ,the all-time box-office Titanic ...The special effects in the movie is Byond Imagination, and Cameron showed us how to use them. Many of them he invented himself! The love story of Jake and Neytiri also really touching one,plot which featured the conflict between two species, namely the Na'vi of Pandora ..Humans tendency is exploit everything ...its resembles Spanish settlers European atrocities against red Indian's Native Americans comparison between human vs navi .Avatar's origins, however, come from the Sanskrit language Oldest Language in the World in sacred Hindu texts, and Avatar it's a term for divine beings sent to restore goodness to Earth.It is believed that these deities sent avatars ‚Äî incarnations of themselves in human form ‚Äî to perform ""dharma,"" or righteous duty, to right wrongs or to restore peace and goodness.And James Cameroon used Blue color which is similar to Hindu god Vishu and avatar Ram,Lord Krsna ! Star Wars,Matrix Trilogy all those Sci-Fi Movies where based on Eastern Philosophy Hinduism & Metaphysics .'Avatar' i epic adventure Above all its fun to watch along with a crowd in theater and not at home .!!

38,"I want to start this review with the note that this is my first review ever,i did not write one until now because i am a critical person and i have not met a movie yet which moved me so deeply that i felt the need to write a review. I saw today Avatar in 3d with some friends,i went to the movie knowing it has nice effects and visuals but with no big expectations, i do not know if i have ever been more surprised in my entire life , this movie has absolutely incredible breathtaking visuals.And here is the good part,it does not only deliver images which you could watch for days without a break,but the story is also intense and well written.When Jake Sully takes control of hes avatar for the first time i almost cried, if you are a sickly person like i am,never been able to do sports or enjoy runs, then those moments will deeply move you,he develops so much joy and fun running around ,breathing deep, feeling the nature ,it takes you in ,and makes you want a new body. Throughout the movie i cried ( and i am 22 years old), i laughed ,i had shivers running down my spine,i had so much anger i nearly stood up and punched somebody,and at some scenes my heart even skipped a few beats,which never happened watching another movie before.This movie just overwhelms you with emotions.The outcome of the movie makes you seriously think about us people ,about our lives and how we treat the nature and animals,about our behavior as mankind,we enjoy killing and destruction instead of respecting ourselves and others and the world that surrounds us. I recommend this movie to anybody,especially those people who can understand the deeper meaning,it is very likely that this movie will stay with you for the rest of your life,and its sure that this is one of the best movies ever made.",neutral
39,"This is my first comment on IMDb. The reason I'm writing this is because I just finished reading a bunch of reviews by people giving this a single star claiming that this movie is terrible and boring. Okay, everyone has their own opinion, but seriously?? Never in my life have I gone to a theater 6 times for a single movie. It is visually outstanding. Cameron just puts you in the heart of Pandora as you are literally living there. The use of 3D just adds magic to the experience; you don't need the typical objects popping in your face to enjoy 3D. Every single detail in this epic is amazing down from the tiny flying insects to the giant flying creatures. Music is breathtaking, gives you a rush at many times. I also actually fell in love with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) as she is without doubt ""man of the match"". Unfortunately Mr. Cameron has ruined it for me, I went to see Sherlock Holmes, good movie BTW, but I just didn't know how to enjoy it. OK, the acting wasn't top-notch; a lot of cheesy lines and of course an unoriginal storyline. But hey, this is sci-fi/ fantasy film. It's supposed to be action packed and visually stunning. That's the point. Go watch the movie as a very entertaining theatrical 3D experience and don't try to look for plot holes and character development. CGI: never witnessed before, STORY: old, but never before told like this, MUSIC: perfect, JAMES CAMERON: fantastic job. With out a doubt, 10/10. Definitely in my top list along with ""The Last Samurai"" - imagine that.",positive
40,"Avatar: The Way of the Water is visually breathtaking and entertaining. The storyline is original and only leave a want for more. The length of the film was no concern and needed for proper character development. The characters in the film were a good selection and made the film more enjoyable and watchable. The movie may be classified as scifi, but it meets the expectation of almost every genre. Like the first Avatar, this movie wil be my go to movie until the next Avatars come out. Both Avatar movies are deserving of the best movie title. Thank you, James Cameron, you did not disappoint. I look forward to the next installments.",positive
41,"AVATAR is the Jurassic Park of this generation, with no doubt is it a family film, but it is also a hybrid of everything good in Cameron.Firstly, The highly-talked about visuals have given me, and the audience a true experience, if that is counted by the number of gasps, claps and heartbeats of every audience member, I seriously didn't get that in Transformers or 2012, people literally gasped when Jake explored the Bio-Luminescence nightlife of Pandora, now that is something you don't usually get in films! But this film isn't just about visuals, it's about the magic of film-making. And that is something rarely achieved in such absolute beauty, beauty that leaves you walking away from the theater, wanting to return the next day, and the day after that. I have never felt so good after watching a movie, a movie that holds such beautiful magic, since the original star-wars trilogy came out back in the 70's and 80's.The film ends leaving you wanting more, it starts by slowly enticing you, then gradually building up into one heck of an adventure, rolling at such a speed that you'd never think it would end, but films end eventually, and I just hope that we are given more in the future, so seriously, enjoy the power of seeing it for the first-time, watch it with a fresh-mind, an empty bowl and zero distractions because the world of Pandora awaits, the trip of a lifetime to an alien world beyond your imagination!",neutral
42,"At the risk of repeating what countless others have said, this movie is blatant plagiarism. If a film student submitted the Avatar screenplay to an instructor, he/she would have been given an F. Colleges expel students for less obvious ripoffs than this. If you've watched Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves, you know the drill. The only difference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting humans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is a rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and Scot. As a result, I am perhaps overly sensitive to the plight of a civilization driven from their homeland and/or oppressed by a conquering nation - er, planet.However, originality is not James Cameron's strong suit, so my disappointment is directed more at WETA. Yes, my beloved WETA, who impressed me throughout the years but completely stole my heart after the masterful rendering of all things Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I had two reasons for seeing this film. One was a 13-year-old boy, the other was my anticipation over what wonders WETA would lay at my feet.Now, had the budget not been nearly half a billion dollars, I'd have understood the cartoonish creations, but as it stands there's no good reason for the results. Viewers are praising this film as revolutionary. I call ""horsesh!t"". This was nowhere near the caliber of WETA's LOTR work, their King Kong work, or their X-Men work. In fact, it wasn't even up to snuff with their Narnia production. The quantity of work was greater, not the quality.I've never reviewed a film in my life. I actually registered here for the sole purpose of expressing my resentment at having wasted $20 bucks and 3 hours on such nonsense. Booooooo.",negative
43,"The visuals and 3D are truly amazing. Some people spend Thousands for traveling to see beautiful landscapes and that's fine. But in the cinema we see the most beautiful world and the visuals are so good, one forgets being in a cinema. It feels like 3 hour trip to another planet. Some people say its boring, because the story is not unique. But that doesn't matter. A movie is a story and how the story is told is 100 times more important than the story itself. Every crime movie has same story: Someone dies -> detective identifies murderer. Yet we want to see HOW the detective does it.Actually I think, there are not so many different base stories and many movies are similar to each other. But Avatar has only one similar movie which is why people notice it.No one would complain about a crime movie: I know this story from this movie, and that movie, and that movie, and this one as well... Oh and this one and that one.",positive
44,If i may rate it 11 i will surely do. Can't wait for Avatar 2 at 2021,positive
45,"Never before have I felt the need to express my views about a movie online except when I saw Lord of the Rings for the first time.Let's get it straight- the ONLY thing ordinary about Avatar is its screenplay. It's not bad, just ordinary. Story is clich√©d, but very relevant. Everything else about the movie is just out of the world, literally! This is not a movie like Pulp Fiction or Fight Club. It doesn't require intelligence to understand the plot. But seriously, who cares? The visuals are so stunning and wonderful that you are sucked into Pandora. You feel like you are living on Pandora and watching the actors over their shoulders. This is where 3D filming has been put to great use in this movie. I can only speak for myself but I related to the characters so well that I was almost emotionally attached to them an hour into the movie.The two main messages of the story are environmentalism and peace. Both of them are extremely relevant today. But then again, the purpose of this movie is not just to carry those messages across. It's to show a completely different world in stunning detail and to let the viewers relate that world to our own. To me, it talks also about fighting injustice, even if it is perpetuated by ""your own"" people. The biological theory of connections between all the living things on the planet was pretty cool and is truly, the worldwide web.The acting doesn't stand out as mind-blowing but blame it not on the actors, but the visuals. James Horner, as always, delivers with the music. It is so inextricably linked to the scenes that you probably won't be able to imagine enjoying the movie without it. Special effects, needless to say, are outstanding! CGI on this scale for hundreds of characters is no mean task. Dialogs, as I mentioned before, are not extra-ordinary but then again, you don't expect a marine to be Shakespeare in his linguistic articulation. They definitely fit in with the plot.This definitely is another milestone in movie-making and will definitely spawn a lot more special-effects filled movies. All in all, the movie rises above others of its class for the way in which this rather simple-minded story is told. I still can't stop playing through the scenes in my mind. Go watch it and let go of your worries and live in Pandora for 166 minutes and trust me, it's a wonderful life!",positive
46,"Science fiction is, at its core, more than just a hypothetical fantasy about our distant neighbours twinkling in the night. It is also a reflection on humanity. It holds the mirror up to our faces and forces us to question who we are; when our aspirations, morals, ideals and weaknesses are put to the test, are we really who we think? And what is our place in the great darkness that surrounds us, frightens and amazes us? To know your own culture; learn another man's customs. It is only by comparison that we can truly see ourselves. And it is also only us, as subjective individuals, that can know who we are beneath our human exteriors. Many of us focus too much on our weaknesses and turn to God/s and religion for love and acceptance despite our faults, with heaven as the ultimate point of approval. Acceptance by someone or something that truly sees us, not only the shortcomings, but also for what we hope to believe that we fundamentally are; good, decent, with the heart in the right place, trying to make the best of what we have been given. Some of us don't believe in God, or profoundly question his/her/its existence. Many fear death, the unknown, never to see, feel or experience anything again. To be forgotten. For ever.So the question becomes: does this introduction have a point and what does Avatar have to do with it? Mr James Cameron is a self-proclaimed sci-fi nerd and - not to mention - a human being (although I agree questionable, let us make that assumption for convenience sake) and just like many of us I am sure he shares many of the same existential thoughts and questions that find their way into our human brains and skeptic hearts. And like many of us he seems to share a craving for adventure, discovery, enlightenment and a curiosity of the world, the universe and the beings with whom we happen to share our short time here on Earth.With Avatar, Mr Cameron manages to address most of these existential questions: who are we? Not in the comfort of our living rooms, nestled in the sofa with a bag of crisps and a chocolate bar in front of the TV, but in the face of choice. The choice between convenience and what we believe in. When all the luxuries have been taken away, and all the shields and walls and layers have been peeled off, do we like what we see? Avatarians have an expression; ""I see you"", which comes with such a deep ring to it because it is what we all want the world and people around us to do; to recognize, appreciate and care about us and to see that no matter how we might act and react on occasions, deep down we are good. These glasses we desire others to wear when they look at us also have another umbrella term; love. Some say love is blind, but to me at least, real love is not blind, it is understanding. It looks beyond the flaws and recognizes us for all the good things that we are. It sees our actions from our point of view.The story of Pandora's box in Greek mythology depicts how numerous evils were let into our world in a moment of weakness on Pandora's behalf. In much the same way, humanity in James Cameron's Avatar goes to the planet of Pandora and is confronted with a choice; open the lid or let the box be. Naturally, the greed (for money, power, etc) wins, and so, the lid is opened. Naturally, it has consequences. However, just like in the original story of Pandora's box, something else was let into the world when the lid was pulled away, something to counterbalance the evils that had been unleashed; hope. The hope that the good will, eventually, win. In Cameron's Avatar, this hope is represented by a group of humans who are not set out to exploit the people and resources of Pandora, but to understand it. And with understanding comes the ability to see clearly, and with this comes, ultimately, love. Love is not blind, but ignorance is, and ignorance is the root of most evils taking place in the world today.We all choose how we want to see the world. Everything is neutral as far as the universe is concerned; there is no good or evil, no good or bad, no morals set in some sacred stone at the heart of the heart of the universe. Morals are what we, humans, have created because we have a conscience. We have the ability to empathise and sympathise, to see the world through other's eyes as if they were our own.On Pandora, everything is connected; the trees, the animals, the flora and fauna, the past and the present, the living and the dead. If we as humans could be as connected with each other and communicating as much, I believe understanding of each other's differences would ultimately result in the realisation that we are in fact more similar than different. I believe that one such medium of communication already exists today ‚Äì the Internet. Another one is the media but the question is how well it is working.I think Cameron's intended message with this film is very simple and ‚Äì I admit ‚Äì very clich√©, but also very true and it doesn't hurt to be reminded of every once in a while; to see what we value and to stand up for it.Plus, it's easier to see the world through another's eyes when it's presented with such smashing CGI...",positive
47,"Looking into Hindu mythology, when Gods descend to Earth they acquire avatars to make themselves known by human beings. Of the recent years' TV animation series let's look over ""≈åban Star-Racers"" from Jetix and ""The Last Airbender"" from Nickelodeon for avatar concept. In ≈åban Star-Racers, the Earth had been threatening by antagonist galactic races and human beings were expecting a savior from space who is called the Avatar. On the other hand in the Last Airbender, avatar concept was completely confused with Prophecy. Aang the Avatar was born in the form of human being, which is wrong; because Avatar is a form of a God which has no destiny, no life, no death. Herein James Cameron's Avatar, the concept is truly appropriate to the origins of Hindu mythology: When humankind explores the planet Pandora, they aimed to search for underground resources; so they send an ex-serviceman to the natives in a DNA mapped hybrid body(which seems like one of them) to capture their secrets. Becoming the Avatar of natives by time, the ex-serviceman saves the planet from humankind, turning against his origin. Exploring a new planet, descending on the ground, trying to capture it by blending within natives, but failing to do so... This actually is the same storyline with a Sci-Fi legend: Franklin Schaffner's ""Planet of The Apes(1968)"". Still keeping its sense with having the most terrifying ending of all science fiction works ever created, Planet of The Apes has so many things in common with Avatar. The Apes and the Na'vis both seemed atrocious and uncivilized at first. Then we realized that they're in fact very cuddly creatures. Both Charlton Heston and Sam Worthington became beloved with a female native, and we're introduced to their untouched and God's gift virgin nature. Then as in Star Wars and Abyss, humankind declares war against the natives to capture their lands and resources. Another unique similarity between Planet of the Apes is that humankind is the evil-side again. So the same message we get with a deeper self-criticism is that humankind is the one who destroys the nature and is responsible of all wars. Wasn't this the Terminator's message as well, spoken out by Sarah Connor? ""It's in our nature to destroy ourselves"". All to the good, we didn't lose our World to apes or cyborgs this time.",positive
48,"I must admit I had my doubts about this movie when I saw it in previews a couple months ago. I really didn't know what to think of the movie then. I saw this movie twice, the first time in regular 2d and the second in 3d. I have to say I was simply astonished at the visuals in this movie. Some scenes do tend to ""pop"" out a little more than others, but I was simply transfixed and awestruck not only at the incredible look of the movie but of the storyline itself. This movie really makes one think about life and how we might not be the only ones in the universe. Science fiction usually brings about thoughts on this, but we do have the ""Kepler probe"" already out there looking for another habitable planet, that isn't science fiction but is a reality. This movie also brings up another incredible aspect humans have struggled with. Humor me and go along with me for a minute - If a hundred or so years from now the human race had actually found another habitable planet and there was a less-advanced civilization living on it. Could our race be civil and humanitarian on the ways we try to establish contact? Would establishing contact really be the best thing to do? This movie might also seem quite similar to the early colonizers coming overseas from Europe to North America. Where the humans symbolize the prospecting company and the natives symbolize the Navi. This movie really does have a lot more going for it than just stunning visuals. I myself think this movie is the best sci-fi yet. I might even be bold enough to say that this could be the new ""Star Wars"" of our generation.",positive
49,Avatar tells a familiar story but its a story that works so well inside of this movie. The visuals and 3d are still one of the best to date and i totally get why it made so much money.,neutral
50,"I did my best to keep the expectations low, but it didn't quite work out. I mean, it's a movie directed by James Cameron, featuring sassy badass Space Marines, evil corporations, power armor, and Sigourney Weaver. That's the closest I'll ever get to a direct Aliens sequel, definitely one of my top 5 movies of all time and inspiration of countless wet military sci-fi dreams.On the other hand, although trying to stay spoiler-free, I kinda did expect something that would turn me off on a certain levels, hearing things about ""dances with wolves"" in space and a straight green message, delivered in black and white, without the necessary shades of grey in between. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for saving the planet and respecting the natives, but I like my messages delivered in a subtle way that makes me care, instead of the sledgehammer-in-your-face method. See ""the day the earth stood still"" remake. Bah, humbug.Third point: My first movie in 3d. Wasn't sure how it would work out for me with my glasses, and if it would enhance or distract from the experience. Really, I had no clue.So. here's a spoiler-free, very personal summary of what I think: Go. See. That. Movie.In a nutshell: It's flawed, but for me, a flawless experience. It's extremely CGI-heavy (something I couldn't be more sceptic about), but it's CGI you buy into. The designs, the human characters, the animated characters, there's just... chemistry. The illusion is there and makes you overlook the obvious. The plot is predictable, but it didn't give me time to predict, because it gripped me and didn't let me go. See, a movie can have the most blatant story, the question is how it is delivered by the people involved, from the actors to the director. That's the theory, and I was always sceptic of such gibberish. But boy, it was delivered, straight to my inner child, on a silver plate full of awesome. It immersed me. It worked. I was in awe. I was in tears. I was cheering. The whole premise, the parallels to our history, the message, the love story, it's all naive. And I'm so glad that it just shut the **** up that cynic in me in the most elegant way for three hours and made me naive and open for the beauty and wit and wonder in it. I didn't think I was still capable of that, but I watched that movie with the wide, blue eyes of a fourteen year old, enjoying a thrilling, heartbreaking mix of ""ALIENS"" and ""E.T."".Also, sh** blows up really good.See, the Star Wars prequels were something that should have been just that. Instead, I was pulled out of it and shaking my head all over the place. I was pulled out by wooden, badly-directed actors acting confused in front of too much blue screen. I was pulled out by half-assed cartoony CGI characters. By video game sequences of unbelievable combat and plot holes as big as a small moon.And here's the movie where it's all so flawless, human and elegant- characters, effects, delivery- that I gladly overlook its faults and enjoy it for what makes it awesome. Here's the spiritual successor of the movies I grew up with and loved, that just left me dreaming. Suddenly I remember how it was to watch 1977's Star Wars for the very first time. Grinning, crying, cheering and clapping.This is it. But don't listen to me, I'm being a biased fanboy here.See? It managed to make me a biased fanboy. Nothing has done that in a decade. And it feels so good!",positive
51,"I remember watching Avatar when I was 9 years old and loving it back in 2009. 11 years later I thought I'd revisit it as some people w had been talking about it ironically how it is amazing, etc. And this movie kinda blew me away. We watched the extended cut that tags on 16 minutes of intro before the real film begins and that added a sense of new-ness to the movie. The animation and visuals at times blew me away and made me realize why this movie was such a cultural landmark for cinema. At other times id did look a little bit like a ps3 game where the graphics take a minute to load and everything is smooth without texture. I also forgot about how hard hitting the message of the movie is and how revolutionary AVATAR really is! James Cameron knows how to appeal to a large audience hook people in and show them a message that they cant argue with. Avatar shows us the exploitative nature of Capitalism and the husks of people behind it and how its good to go against the grain of societies order. The main character although some complain that he's not interesting or a good actor works even better for this message as he is clueless and he's 100% on the side of the military and the state and gets convinced ad won over to then lead the revolutionary battle for freedom. He is an unmemorable, plain character than makes a decision to do what's right and that relates to the masses. You don't have to be the most charismatic perfect person to make change. Where Starship Troopers (although satirical) is a movie to promote fascism (again satirical, I love this movie) and authoritarianism, Avatar is our movie to promote the right path we have to take, a path away from capitalism and it cannot be long lasting. (Also its creepy how James Cameron kinda precited Venezuela and still impressive how he Invented all that 3D Technology)",positive
52,This movie has been described as breathtaking and beautiful and that is certainly true to an extent but I would also add that it runs way too long and gets boring.,neutral
53,"Director James Cameron's return to the world of science fiction cinema is a glorious one indeed. Twelve years after delivering us the highest grossing film of all time, Cameron brings us the sci-fi epic Avatar, a film that is not only visually breathtaking, but also character driven, emotional, exciting, effective, and masterfully directed.The marketing and hype for this movie was mostly based around the groundbreaking visual effects, so I'll start there. I was lucky enough to get to see this film in a digital 3D theater. My only complaint is with myself, in that I wish I had seen a couple of 3D movies before this one. This was my first experience with a 3D film, so I really didn't have anything to compare it against, but all I knew from the very first shot of the movie was that this was going to be unlike anything I had ever seen before. At first it took me a while to adjust to the dimensions of the film, but after my eyes got used to what i was seeing, I realized that what I was looking at was not a 3D gimmick but a world with an incredible amount of depth. James Cameron rarely gets right in your face with the big things in this movie. He is more subtle than that. The things that appear to be directly in front of you (and they really do) are the little things that capture the ambiance of the scene and make you feel like you're there with the characters. The rest of the 3D effect serve to add dimensions and reality to the scenes.The visual achievement in this film is not in the action scenes (which are some of the most exciting I've ever seen) but in the lengths that were gone to to bring this world to life. James Cameron has created a planet, a species, and a culture that work in perfect harmony with each other, and likewise the visuals are in perfect harmony. I'll admit I was a little apprehensive that this movie was more computer animated than live action. To me that usually suggests that a film crew is getting lazy, and that it's going to look like a video game. That is not at all the case here. The truth is that without computer animation there is no other way this film would have looked this impeccable. The planet of Pandora is extremely beautiful and detailed, and the Na'vi species fit with it perfectly. In all honesty, you can in fact tell that the aliens are computer animated. They still haven't quite attained the ability to make CG characters that look absolutely 100% unquestionably real, and in a live action world they might still have suffered the out-of-place look that many CG characters in movie get. However, in the computer animated world of Pandora, they blend in seamlessly and beautifully. This is of course not to downplay the design of the na'vi. They look as real as you could possibly hope for. The nearness they have come to looking real, the motion capture used in this movie, the range of facial expressions and emotions that they show, are all unprecedented.All of that being said, the next big question about this movie is this: Are visual effects all it has to offer? My answer: Not at all. The depth of Avatar goes far beyond the visuals themselves.As with all of Cameron's movies, Avatar is character driven. The central characters of the film are all dynamic, well written, and very well acted. You go on an adventure with them and throughout the movie you fall in love them (or grow to despise them depending on which characters).The general plot-line of the movie is a bit generic but that's okay. No, the premise isn't anything completely brand new, but it's still an excellent plot, and one that is familiar to our society and very important for us to remember. Along with that there are still several aspects of the plot that are quite original. James Cameron took a familiar story, one that many storytellers before him have told version of, and made it his own. Furthermore, this is one of those movies where you predict things because you want to see them happen, and when your predictions turn out to come true it's gratifying. That's not to say that everything is predictable, because that would get old. Don't worry, Cameron has thrown in a fair amount of little surprises too.This film is also as much emotionally effective as it is visually effective. James Cameron is a master at getting a certain emotion or feeling out of his viewers, and every scene in the movie works toward one or more of these effects. It's very light-hearted at times, with a good bit of comedic relief, and then quite intense in other scenes. Some scenes make you fear for the main characters, or perhaps even for yourself. Much of the film is brimming with anticipation and suspense, and several scenes had me simply grinning with excitement.Overall this is one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had. Avatar is groundbreaking, dynamic, powerful, and a ton of fun. I must say it was worth the wait, but I certainly hope Cameron is here to stay this time.10/10",positive
54,"James Cameron once more shows that he knows what he is doing. I finally get to watch it yesterday in 3D after waiting so long, and it was worth all the reviews and even better. I am still in shock from what I experienced. The visual effects and the 3D experience in the movie- you have to watch it with your own eyes to feel the magic James Cameron has captured with this masterpiece. Acting is excellent, you can't ask for anything more than the actors gave from science fiction. Whoever said no love or passion in the movie is mistaking big time, it has something for everyone starting from astonishing score (bravo! James Horner) and love story, big epic, awesome war episode and a unrepeatable beauty of Pandora- WOW. If you didn't like the movie at any point, you seriously need to see your doctor. After coming out of the cinema, all I could think about was to go back in, so that's what I am doing today and probably tomorrow as well. Thank you, James Cameron for the best experience of my life!",positive
55,"Avatar, undoubtedly an amazing experience, will redefine the boundaries of modern cinema. The magnum opus of the master craftsman James Cameroon delivers magical screen realization to innovative imagination. It took over a decade for the fast-paced technology to catch up to brilliant imaginations of James Cameroon.It is the movie of the decade in terms of cinematic imagination (even crossing the earlier standards set by LOTR trilogy) and movie of the generation in terms of CG. The advantage of Avatar is that the movie not only revolves around the hype of $300 million and IMAX 3D, but has an involving political statement. It brings into light, three major issues. Firstly, the movie itself stands as metaphor of the US invasion of Iraq. Secondly it unveils imperialism's cold blooded face in disrespecting and demolishing cultures. Lastly it has a profound green political statement that insists on bio-diversification. Even though it doesn't indulge itself into individualist philosophies, Avatar is not philosophically void. It is illuminated (like the illuminating insects and plants of Pandora) by the philosophy of universal identity believed by the Na'vi tribe. The concept of Eywa really matches with the base theory of coexistence of many human civilizations. Some may say story of Avatar is old wine (pointing Dances with wolves, The Last Samurai and all). But, the invasion on aboriginal cultures and human civilizations by imperialist powers is repetitive - it happened during civil war, it happens in Iraq. So the story isn't loosing its relevance but deserves the retelling.But beyond all this, the breathtaking visuals will steal the show and will surely leave you with a once in a lifetime cinematic experience. The thrilling action sequences in sky, mammoth animals , legendary Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora, and scenes in which Jake tames the flying dragon bird -Mountain Banshee and biggest creature in sky -Toruk, all leaves a mark in history of cinematic visuals. It is the CG that even shadows the 3D. but don't miss the show in 3D as not seeing this movie in 3D will be the greatest loss. Hats off to the one man - James Cameroon, who imagined the unimaginable and realized the impossible. Avatar makes the sci-fi cinema so far, paraplegic as the protagonist Jake Sully in human form and a new era of visual entertainment starting from this movie, as mind blowing as the blue Avatar itself.",positive
56,"The sheer amount of pressure for one single film from one single man was so immense, that it is a wonder that Cameron even dared to tip-toe back into the film industry for one brief glance, let alone make an actual movie. And yet, it is an extremely rare and beautiful thing that something is created which can not only meet it's former film in pretty much all aspects as well as the pressure from media all over the world, but dare even to out shine it. Yet i have to agree that Avatar, in my opinion, does just that.I cannot deny that Titanic was not a piece of marvel and excellence, and the scale of the special effects as well as the intensity of that infamous jack and rose love story were so remarkable that is was enough to leave most that watched it weep like a small child. However, Avatar gives us a look at a different story of love, and like Titanic, it is forbidden and frowned upon, yet is still heart warming and similarly tragic in some places. The only criticism I have is that the love between Jake and Neytiri lacks that throat choking moment which still holds Titanic in such high regard even today. On the other hand it also must be commented that despite these films being among the most expensive ever made, the story lines do not rely on they're huge explosions and crashing objects to make the movie, because both of the stories are deeper and more meaningful than that and they manage not to drown in the special effects like so many films nowadays do.Speaking of the spectacular effects, those in Avatar are really just that. The beauty of Pandora makes you get goose pimples as the sheer detail of exotic plants and dangerous animals feel so real that you have to remind yourself continually that they do not actually exist. And if you are not as soft as to fall in love with the beauty of the planet, than I'm sure the final battle will make you heart race and you will truly be blown away by the incredible effects that all of Cameron's team have managed to achieve, this really is film making at it's best. Don't be put off by the length or the fact that it's sci-fi because i do not doubt that coming out of that film, no matter what your favourite genre, will leave you so speechless and amazed that the only word you will be able to breathe is 'wow.'",positive
57,"This is the most astonishing movie I have ever seen. First word I heard leaving the theater was 'amazing!' No doubt about it.I won't discuss the plot,but the plot is good, nothing can match the special effects of the 3-D.Here's the least you need to know:It is 'new age' all the way. It's all about 'we are all one with nature'.It's a long movie, about 3 hours to be precise. Be sure you have your snack in hand and your 'business' taken care of, just in case you don't have a 15 min break like I did. Sexuality was not much of an issue, the only thing remotely sexual was the 'hair-bonding' ritual.The ending was predictable from the start, but again an extremely enjoyable movie.Finally, the special effects were amazing. This you got to see in 3-D!!! You'll feel as if you are IN the movie after a few minutes. You'll be reaching for the floating jellyfish(tree seeds), dodging the flying dragon-birds...etc. I was so impressed that I felt as if it was all happening in front of my own eyes. I do not recommend watching this movie in 2-D. I believe that this movie was made to be viewed in 3-D. The movie is not only a movie but it will open your mind and make you reflect on your life. As I wrote earlier it's kinda ""new age vs modern world view"". I truly hope that you enjoy the movie. I know that I did. 3-D is a must !!! just a few extra bucks, believe me you won't regret it. the only thing that makes me sad :( is that I have to wait until late 2010 to buy the 3-D bluray. enjoy :)",neutral
58,"AVATAR is one of the few films in recent years that I've really looked forward to. Given Cameron's solid track-record when it comes to sci-fi/action-films, there was no doubt in my mind that this film would be good, even though it's been 12 years since his last feature film. The only question in my mind was whether the film would be great or merely good. Fortunately, it turned out to be the former.I'll start by mentioning a few things that I really liked about the film, and areas in which I feel it succeeded very well: The characters: Cameron invests enough time in his characters so that the viewer actually care about them when the going gets tough later on in the film. Most action-directors put too much emphasis on the action and fail to involve the audience on an emotional level: You couldn't care less what happens to the main characters and the feeling of genuine suspense is severely undermined. AVATAR is an action/adventure film with a heart.The CG (primarily by WETA Digital) looks great, especially when it comes to organic objects, such as plants and the blue humanoid-looking natives. The great attention to detail makes a significant difference in terms of photorealism. The natives move and express themselves in a very convincing, natural manner. Mocap (*) has been used for many years, but this is one of the few films in which the movements (both body and face) look completely realistic. AVATAR sets a new milestone when it comes to photorealistic characters. I was also very impressed by the seamless integration of CG and live shots, and the CG explosions: The explosions were actually created using fluid simulations which made them look very realistic (the normal approach is to use live shots of real explosions, composited on top of CG elements).The directing: With AVATAR, Cameron demonstrates why I consider him one of the best action directors in modern cinema. The long finale, in particular, is one of the best action-sequences I've ever seen. It's dynamic, intense and exhilarating to watch. The rhythm and pacing is spot on. Cameron also slowly builds the film to its finale, and this makes the action-sequences even more rewarding (because the buildup serves as 'foreplay' and creates anticipation).Other things that I liked: The beautiful cinematography and the interesting, underlying themes related to imperialism and the environment. It makes you think a bit after you leave the theatre, and it adds a bit of extra depth and meaning to the film. This is more than you can expect from a typical film in this genre nowadays.It's hard to pick things that I didn't like about the film, because there was nothing that really bothered me. If I had to mention one thing that I was hoping would be better, then it would be James Horner's score. It didn't seem as prominent or memorable as it should've been. Its impact on the overall movie experience was much smaller compared to his score for films such as TITANIC, ALIENS or BRAVEHEART. I'm not saying the score is bad, far from it, it just lacked that little extra.Some people have complained about the simple plot and predictable ending. I personally didn't have any issues with the plot, and I must admit that I don't really understand those who get too obsessed with spotting plot holes and logical problems. First of all, it's not really the story itself that matters, its the way it's told, because film is primarily an audiovisual medium. Cameron's films are simply structured in general and they're easy to follow. But he makes things interesting and engaging to watch because of his storytelling skills. Although the film lasts for over 2,5 hours, I never felt there was a dull moment. Cameron sucked me into the film from the get go and he didn't loosen his grip until the end-credits started to roll.I've seen both the 3D and 2D version. Some people clearly prefer the 3D version, but I didn't feel that I lost anything substantial when I saw the 2D version. Cameron doesn't make the mistake of trying to use 3D as a cheap gimmick, and the use of 3D effects isn't exaggerated. The 3D effect is impressive, though, and the technology has obviously improved significantly in recent years. After a few minutes into the film I almost forgot that I was wearing the glasses: They were comfortable and they didn't cause dizziness.AVATAR is a visual tour de force that really needs be seen on the big screen in order to be appreciated fully. Don't wait until the DVD or Blu-Ray is released: The experience simply won't be the same, unless you have a big, high-end home-theatre.(*) Motion capture: Technology used to capture the actors's performances, so that they can be reproduced by their CG characters.",positive
59,"Like Peter Jackson and George Lucas, James Cameron raises the level of technical achievement in film making in every movie he makes, and Avatar is no exception. We have set before us a digital masterpiece of beauty and spectacle, where the technology has once again surprised us, but the beauty and imagination of the artists behind it inspires us even more. Now, as before, much of the movie was green screened, but unlike before, it doesn't matter. When live actors are on the screen, they actually look less real than their surroundings. The idealized Na'vi are sacred, vivid, and real. Live actors are dimly lit, phony profanities in James Cameron's digital reality. The central problem with the story is its appalling lack of originality. The plot, and moment after moment in this film, is ripped from previous movies with reckless abandon. No person who has seen such movies as Dances with Wolves, the Last Samurai, Pocahontas (Dis.) or any number of other movies should be surprised at any part of the story here. The plot is simply an excuse to string together a beautiful canvas of rich, detailed digital fantasy art. Soldiers are portrayed here either as self-hating pansies or narrow-minded bad asses. The Na'vi are portrayed as a race in perfect balance with the world around them, rather than as products of natural selection with their own defects. Count me as someone who wanted to see a story which had real characters with real people in them, or a twist in the story I didn't see coming. I have a few moral qualms with the story as well, which plays out not as a message about tolerance of differences or peaceful coexistence, but as a racist ballad where the sacred Na'vi have been perverted by contact with the infernal humans and it is the humans that need to be eradicated or exiled.This is a movie you will want to see if eye-popping visuals and vivid detail at all appeal to you. But if you're looking for a compelling story that you haven't seen before, look elsewhere. As sci-fi, District 9 is a much better movie, and I would say even Star Trek has the edge on a compelling story line.",neutral
60,"Snapshot: Avatar is a ""visually stunning"" movie that captures your imagination with a pretty ordinary story that SOME might find triteWhy I LOVED IT?When people were first informed about Avatar NO ONE spoke about ""A Great Story"" or ""Wonderful and complex Characters"". Avatar was supposed to be a treat for the eye, a very imaginative and immersive world. Avatar exactly does that. I LOVED it because it delivers what it promised to!Why is it ""Ground Breaking"" and ""Stunning""?Avatar totally blew me away in the visuals department. Now I know some people are saying that there are many movies that look more ""REAL"" and have better quality of animation than Avatar e.g. Final Fantasy, but I guess these people are missing the point. Avatar is actually about NOT looking real, it is about showing something that we have never seen or have never imagined (exotic creatures and floating mountains!!!). It is also about meticulous attention to details that we may actually never notice especially when we see the movie for the first time. So ultimately using fine details and imagination of some very creative artists a stunning and immersive world called ""Pandora"" has been created. What's NOT good? Avatar does not try to do anything new in the story line department. It's got a couple cheesy dialogues and just a touch predictable. It is the same old story told in a new way. But then how many movies that are made are really original today? From my perspective I even LIKED the story but some people with different taste, perspective and expectations might complaint!Who should watch it? I suggest EVERYONE, at least for ""Pandora""Who should avoid it? NO ONE! HOWEVER if you are VERY RELUCTANT about ""ORIGINAL STORY"", ""GREAT CHARACTERS"" blah blah blah and just cannot get the message right then don't watch it, but then you will be missing something very special ""Trust me"" on this one!SummaryGo for the movie with the right expectations i.e. ""An imaginative and visually spectacular movie"" and put other things like a ""GREAT STORY"" aside. Avatar is everything what it promised to be and that is why I give it 10/10",positive
61,"This is not the worst movie ever made, but it's not something that will change the direction of cinema either, and it's definitely not something I would want to sit through a second time. Like Cameron's Titanic it will largely be forgotten in ten years to the point that people in the future will just not believe all of the hype that went on at the time it was in theaters.Cameron is brilliant with special effects and technology, but he's a good businessman with a sense of showmanship too, and thus he realizes that if he simply made a documentary entitled ""How I Did It"" and showed off and explained how he produced some of his pioneering technological tricks, that nobody but a few dozen geeks such as myself would buy a ticket to see it.Thus a narrative is added - usually an obvious and emotionally manipulative one - to draw in the largest audience. That was what was done in Titanic, and that is the case here. I can't say that Cameron plagiarized the story either, because he's also a master at taking known story lines and putting them through a blender where you can at no point say this is a retread of any one story. However, it is retread of several well known ones. I won't tell you which stories or else I might give the plot away to the few people left on this planet who haven't seen Avatar and still intend to do so.My recommendation - see it or don't see it. This one won't change your life.",neutral
62,"I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, but I am giving it a 1, because I cannot believe that it deserves an 8.8, which is what it is getting this evening, mostly apparently due to suspicious ratings from countries like Slovakia, India and Australia. Not that I have anything against those countries, it just strikes me as odd that so few good reviews are coming from the United States. I'm not saying that IMDb's ratings are being manipulated by some sort of conspiracy, I am just saying it is odd. Anyways, rather than try and balance my review with what was good (the visuals, the 3D, the sound effects), am just going to say what really sucked. Can I say ""sucked"" in my review? Guess I will find out.1. ""Unobtainium."" Really, ""unobtainium?"" Was this a kid's cartoon? 2. Sigourney Weaver's confused and cartoonish scientist character. She's tough, she smokes, she has a heart of gold, and her Avatar dresses like Dora the Explorer. Also, why try and make her look twenty years younger than she is? I can't tell if they used CGI, Botox, or a ton of make-up, but she looked like the female version of the Picture of Dorian Gray. What a waste of talent.3. Hundres of years in the future, they can create magical avatar clones and transmit brain signals to them, but they still use flimsy wheelchair thingies? 4. Less than a half dozen animals on Pandora, and all but the floating jellyfish are angry and violent. Really? No fish? No birdies? No toads, snails, foxes, puppy dogs, kitty cats, mosquitoes, or anything but those half dozen CGI creature types? Seems like Pandora was populated by a relatively cheap CGI outfit.5. The trees all communicate through synapses, and this is supposed to be ominous, yet this never turns into anything compelling. Did Jimmy Cameron get tired of his own idea? Or was it to hrd to animate something more interesting? 6. Almost half a billion dollars to make this?!?!?!?!? 7. ""Unobtainium?"" ""Unobtainium?????"" 8. Cartoony tough military guy who does not have a clue how to organize a military campaign.9. The Na'Vi speak broken English that somehow becomes perfect English on and off throughout the movie. And the Avatars speak perfect English in normal tone of voice, identical to their human voices, although their bone structure is completely non-human?!?!?!? 10. Unobtainium I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This was like an extremely expensive and pretty kiddie cartoon. What a waste, and absolutely NOT deserving of the rating it is getting here.",negative
63,"well, this is the best movie i ever seen. it is almost too good to be true, u get so sucked into it that at the end it's like the time and everything stops. the most impressive and the most balanced movie i ever saw. u know what they say, u get what u payed for, with the biggest budget you make the best movie. this is the kind of movie that will enter the history, next to the other great movie which impressed the world.about the goofs, one looks incorrect for me.Its more of a talk without thinking. arrows on first attack bounce of the windscreens, and in the second they blast them. its simple, in the first attack, they fire upwards, at an like 30 degrees angle or more, from a big distance, and they are stationary, not to mention that the arrows hit the windows at a 45 degrees plus, which makes them bounce, only few scratch the windows. at the second attack, they dive from above, with high speed, adding speed to the arrow (relative to the target), and they also fire from a few meters, and perpendicular (almost) on the windows. if i am correct, in the second attack, the arrows hit with more then twice the energy, and remember, in the first attack they could scratch the glass.they wouldn't make such mistake, this movie was too well done to make any mistake.I saw many well known and wonderful movies from top 250, at least 100, and they impressed me, i liked them. if I would view them now, after avatar, i don't think they could impress me anymore, just rized the standardsit has 10 stars from me, and i cant wait to see it at the cinema. people who rate this movie less then 8 either they really dun like this kind of movies or are total ignorants. You can't say it's crap when it's yellow and shines.***DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DID NOT WATCHED THE MOVIE YET!!! it might spoil the surprise.***i read like 100 reviews on this movie and i noticed 2 major categories of people the ones who give this move 8+ and have a great impression about it, and another, much smaller, which gave it less then 5, mostly 1 stars, who say 'its a pure eye-candy with a crappy story and no plot, it copies many other movies, and its a ridiculous movie to watch'. that kind of words make my inside burn of frustration. i feel like those people are blind or deaf.its like they don't have a soul any more, they have a heart of cold lead, no imagination, no dreaming. it's horrible. this kinda movie cant be rated on 'points' like sound picture and bla bla bla.Something like this needs an overall opinion. the combination is the true masterpiece. Its a wonder. You cant judge a great picture and say its crap because the paint used is cheap.yesterday i had a flick like idea that passed in my head. i think terminator 2 has a very deep secret message in it. that we wont be killed or taken over by the machines. We are slowly turning into machines (in the inside, literally i mean) because of the environment we live in and the daily routine that we get used to. we will be like living machines. no feelings, no ""soul"", no dreaming, no hopes, just following 'laws' lines, parameters. People like that are starting to appear between us. only a cold blood ""machine like inside"" being cannot be touched by at least 10% of this movie. I hope and pray this is just a ridiculous inexistent coincidence i made. How can someone not be touched by the perfect balance of that wonderful race with the nature, living in harmony. how can u not get emotional at the sight of those hopeless beings after they're home tree is blown to pieces. how not to be sad that humans are a bit same to those in the movie? and the most impressing, how not to get touched by the way that paralyzed man of steel, marine, realized he fought all his life on the wrong side, and now he finally finds something that worth fighting for, real freedom and nature and how not to get touched by the wonderful ultimate freedom of being able to fly on the back of a dragon like creature, and control it like an extension of your mind, up in the sky, ""on top of the world"", between those floating mountains ""i am not too much of a horse guy, but i feel i was born to do this"" he says. from a wheal chair in a metal house, to the top of the sky. and not to mention that in the end he finally gets rid of the horror of waking up from the device that he was depending on to get into the in the wonderland, entering his avatar. His 'soul' is transfered from his human body to the avatar, finally being totally free to live his dream all the rest of his life in that world of perfect balance, full of life, enveloped by nature.I liked how Jake realizes that he fights for the wrong things, when the right thing that is worth to fight for, he was fighting against.Its funny how the colonel says that place is worse then hell, but actually is better then haven. Don't kick the dog! Look in his eyes, scratch him between his ears.Someone says this movie has a soul. I feel the same thing!1 of the most sad things about this movie is that it's just an imagination, a dream about a perfect place, but unreal.",positive
64,"Experiencing this movie, in Imax 3-D, was simply the best movie experience I have ever had. It is great that there is a lot to say about movies but this should be the fist and most important thing. What did the experience of watching evoke in you? I start this way because I have been reading very much about this movie and I have heard so many perspectives on it that I almost lost the direct feeling of it. Moreover the fact that It is being spoken about so much is to me another indication that this is an important and intriguing film. Of course attention in itself it not an indication of value, but it becomes apparent soon that the discussion is very widespread and represents many views that already are inherent to our society itself. As soon as this criterium is not met we should be aware what this movie is trying to do with us or with a certain group of people. From my point of view such a discussion is not going on and what is going on is a fair and multiperspectival approach to a deeply intriguing and moving cinematic masterpiece (even though the last word of this sentence is a bit more personal).Having said all that what is left now is for me to present my contribution to the ongoing dialogue. As one might have guessed I am very positive about the movie and not only because it was a great experience in a 3-D movie theater. This movie clearly has a message that our world needs. The consciousness that wants to aggressively dominate and control the world around itself for the purpose of profit regardless of the consequences for the world of nature, life and living beings is being defeated in here. And it is defeated by the conscious choice of beings living by natural law, by other beings abiding the ways of the spirit of the planet and by the very command of this planetary spiritual will itself. As such this storyline is a simplified but direct representation of processes playing out on the face of earth nowadays where the aggressive military-industrial (american) way of control and manipulation is being defeated by conscious processes on various levels of existence.My wholehearted thank goes to James Cameron and his crew for this fantastic tale of life, love, victory and hope. Thank you for creating this and good luck with all future endeavours (which I am looking forward to).",positive
65,"Some directors go 'further'; some push the boundaries of controversial subject matter, some strive for a new means of expression, some are desperate to make ground-breaking content and others will do anything to be original and unique. Whatever these directors try for, they all dip their toes in the deep end of the unknown pool, and James Cameron is no stranger to these foreign waters.Cameron's filmography is far from a sad story; he is responsible for some of the most technologically advanced and brilliantly original cinema Hollywood has ever seen. From 'The Terminator' (1984) to 'Aliens' (1986), from 'The Abyss' (1989) to 'Titanic' (1997), he has always strived for more than the average Hollywood mega-director, and his latest picture, 'Avatar', looks set to follow in that same path. The film has already been said to be the most expensive film ever made, costing a whopping $237 million, it boasts the latest gadgets and technology, using High Definition cameras and ultra-sleek CGI, and it's been labelled by many as ""the future of cinema"". So, bearing all of these points in mind, Cameron has got a lot to deliver to a very hungry holiday audience, much like he did with 'Titanic'. He succeeded in '97, but will he strike gold again in '09?The film follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington); a paraplegic ex-marine who's been asked to take over the role of his late brother in an 'avatar' experiment. This means that his DNA is genetically developed with another being, to form a second life. He's sent undercover to Pandora; a beautiful moon soaked with luscious foliage and filled with mesmerising creatures. His boss, Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) has set him a mission; he must bond with the natives of the planet; the Na'vi. Once he has bonded with them and gained their trust, Sully must obtain a mineral that lives on their planet. This mineral sells for millions of dollars in the United States. But when Sully meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana); a native of the planet that blossoms with beauty, courage and ruthlessness, he becomes attached to her and the Na'vi people. Now Jake is torn between his mission and his orders, and the planet and people that he learns to love.So, $237 million and 162 minutes later, what are we left with? We are left with one of the most beautiful, captivating and emotional roller-coaster experiences that 2009 has offered us. It totally blew me away, more so than I ever thought it could. Not a one moment are you taken out of the film; the audience is locked in for the film's mega duration, which passes by so quickly. Packed with dazzling CGI and mouth-watering cinematography, 'Avatar' most certainly is the future of American cinema. But it gets better; rather than all the throw-away blockbusters Hollywood has offered us this year, the film's life is in the narrative and character development, rather than the green-screen technology and gizmos. It's not just an attraction on the eyes; you are actually involved with the characters and the overall picture.The planet of Pandora is quite possibly the most stunningly gorgeous thing to grace the silver screen in years. It's plastered with radiant colours, wild flowers, twisted trees, crushing waterfalls and jaw-dropping mountains. I would have happily watched the film even if it just toured around this new world.The film is completely action-packed too; sporting some of the most mesmerising and memorable battle sequences. The fights between the Na'vi and the RDA (Resources Development Administration) are champion.The film also features stellar performances; Saldana is fabulous as Neytiri, Sigourney Weaver is excellent as always in her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, and Lang steals the show as the relentlessly evil Colonel. 'Avatar' is an ultra-brilliant package of proper film-making, and Hollywood glitz. Cameron has had this film is pre-production since the mid '90s, and it's so obvious how much he cares for this picture. Everything is perfectly placed and works accordingly.I'm hard pressed to find any problems with the film; the only thing I would have liked is if it was released in the summer, at least that way there would have been one summer Hollywood hit that was worth watching. But, nevertheless, this film should and will do tremendously at the box-office over the Christmas period and rightly so. Cameron deserves his praise for this picture, because 'Avatar' is so much more than a film, it's a cinematic experience.If you see any films this holiday, make sure this is one of them.'Avatar' is a modern masterpiece. See it.",positive

To be honest with you all, I'm 26 years old....and i have never, ever seen such an entertaining movie like this ever... its really confusing to put this movie in which genre........ coz, there is action, adventure, emotion, love, thrills, chills.....you name it. Even the LOTR trilogy are no match for Avatar. It has all the right ingredients for a great movie...and off-course my favorite....emotion....lots of LOVE and emotion.James Cameron ain't ""The king of the world""....... He is THE GOD OF FILM MAKING. i have only one word for him and his cast & crew.....Awesome!!!Wonderfully executed movie which wont make you bored at all. It will just take you away to Pandora for over 150 minutes without even realizing how fast those minutes went.The technology used was brilliant, CGI animation incorporated with performance capture is something many people haven't even dreamt about. Plus the virtual camera tech & augmented reality system!!!......totally cool....totally awesome!!I'm myself a big fan of such techie stuff and cant wait for the sequels to come in future.....next time, there will be more that meets the eye... Cameron is god..... picturing Pandora like a place seen never before, the flora and fauna, the military gears, choppers etc....animals, birds are all absolutely amazing. And most of all...the NAVI'S!! Making a whole new language from scratch too was a great achievement. Thanks to Paul Frommer. Their is a scene where Jake flies with Neytiri on 2 Banshees......its one of my favorite scenes.....so lovely!!I really wondered the toll it had taken on Cameron and his men to bring these things to life. Wonderful!! Also a superb job done by the actors, without whom, this wouldn't be possible....Especially Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver....To me, watching avatar in 3d was an experience....Not just pop-corn and friends. And Off-course......The center of the movie is all about LOVE. Love...So much love. And even i fell in love with Neytiri!!...i wished she was real!! Though the story lacked some punch, the 3d experience and CGI used will just carry you away for a ride, without even you noticing it. Avatar is truly, one of a kind movie...that is hard to find and will always remain as one of the best movies for all ages.I believe, that from this much info...you all would have got a brief idea about Avatar.....I can guarantee you all that Avatar will be a feast for your eyes...So people.....what are your waiting for???...don't watch it......EXPERIENCE IT!!And may Avatar cross the 2.5 billion $ landmark and win Oscars as well.

Even this bad plot could have been filled with a script with more substance....oh my god! I've never played a shoot'em up video game, and I am not a fan of fantasy, so maybe I should never have watched this movie. Plus, I hate pastels...;-) I like CGI, but without a story ? Mr. Cameron should first have graduated at Pixar College - well, but maybe he would have flunked with flying pastels - maybe he lacks the talent...It is a boring, unoriginal, bad film, a cartoon of the flattest kind. Not worth seeing at all.",neutral
68,"First off, I had never seen IMAX or 3D (only in 80's magazines) and was actually in two minds whether or not too go and see the 3D version... but boy am I glad I did... it should NOT be seen any other way, I went to my new IMAX cinema which opened on the day of Avatar release and was awestruck by the experience, I was so overwhelmed just from the 3D trailers before the movie that it made me physically laugh, I could not control it until I got used to it.The movie itself was amazing, the 'cutting edge' motion-capture CGI mixed in with Stereoscopic 3D (special 3D cameras built by James Cameron himself) all shot in IMAX 70mm film (10 times the resolution of normal movies) it was stunning to say the least, the storyline and dialogue was quite good and characters played very well, Sigourney Weaver played a great role as did the Stephen Lang (the army Colonel), it is a long film but as your engrossed in it - it really does seems to fly over and your left wanting more, the Wildlife and plants on Pandora just come to life, colours and detail were amazing and the 5.1 Dolby Digital was outstanding... robot machines walking from behind the camera and over your head and to the front...as it does its steps were thundering from the back of auditorium right through the middle and to the front whilst a big 30ft 3D robot comes towering over your head into view...AMAZING!! I strongly recommend you go and see this movie in IMAX-3D or just normal 3D if you don't have IMAX (the experience is roughly the same just on a smaller scale) its all cutting edge stuff, Steven Spielberg called it ""the future of cinema"" if you have kids even better - don't expect them (or you) to sleep that night haha",positive
69,"I've read many reviews on IMDb from other users about how this film was poor quality; how the plot is shared with many other films and how predictable the plot of this film was. And yes, i do agree that the plot was rather predictable, but this in no way ruins the film! James Cameron made what can only be described as a masterpiece. Spectacular visual effects, tremendous acting from the talented cast, and a plot that makes the film what it is: thoroughly enjoyable.Negative reviews I've read include a totally predictable plot. I can name a fair few other films that have had a predictable plot, and haven't had any reviews reporting the plots predictability. lord of the rings - Frodo was going to make it. The matrix - Neo is the One. The Star Wars prequels - eventually Anakin was going to turn bad. Oh, and just about every James Bond film ever made = Bond kills the bad guy, saves the world.Relating the film to others like Dances with Wolves? OK, this i shall allow, as the plot is quite similar in some aspects, but this is as far as the similarities go.What I've not seen in reviews panning this film is Avatar's relation to the problems we are yet to face. The film describes our need to venture away from our own planet to fight the energy crisis taking place on earth, bringing us to Pandora. The mineral on Pandora, named 'unobtainium', is what the humans are after, and Cameron does an incredible job of showing through the film just how desperate us as humans could be to get energy that we could use in such a crisis: willing to wipe out the planets indigenous population and drive them away from their home, showing we resort to inhuman acts to satisfy our own needs. This contrasted with problems we have had in the past (driving native Americans out of their homes and off their land to benefit ourselves) presents us with an incredible plot. The problems of our future contrasted with the problems of our past presented in a visually stunning movie.People giving this film a review of less that an least 8/10 stars clearly need to wake up, and realises that this film DOES re-invent movie making.Welcome back James Cameron, we've missed you!",positive
70,"Entirely computer rendered movies are some of my favorites over the last 10 years. The Incredibles, Up, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, (the list is long!). But Avatar doesn't deserve to be on this list. In fact, given the money spent, it is a failure worth 2/10. However ignoring the budget for a second, it is a 6. A summer block buster popcorn movie that somehow is pretending to be a classic.it is bad? it is so well reviewed!well, first, the 3d. The glasses reduce the brightness, and for someone with good vision it just isn't pleasant to sit for 3 hours with a black fuzzy rim bracketing the screen and a plastic weight on your nose. The 3D effect, when executed, _demands_ you look at whatever is in focus lest you get a headache trying the impossible -- to focus the fuzz outside that spot. This is annoying. When 3d is mostly suppressed you'd really rather be watching a regular big screen movie.Second problem. Multiple ones. Forget for a moment the computer graphics. What you are left with is - a clich√© ridden script - the least cohesive imagining of future science I've seen for ages. Stuff that varies from barely better than stuff the Pentagon shows off now, to god-like technology. All set in 2154. - stereotypical characters - a very dull leading man. He sounds a bit like Russell crowe, but there ends that comparison. - an extremely predictable plot. Not just predictable. You've sat through this story before, and parts of it you've seen several times.The worst is the script. On the rare occasion the characters reveal some inner emotion or conflict through subtle action or facial expression, they immediately blurt out their motivation. I guess for the sake of us dim wits in the audience. Meanwhile the full orchestral score swells and swirls almost without a breather from the first second to the last, unnecessarily ramming down our ear canals whatever emotion we are being ordered to feel.A good movie you think about not just the next morning, but the next week. The next month. Avatar only left me annoyed. I couldn't care less about the characters, I was left with zero curiosity for where an Avatar 2 might take them.I'm squarely in the demographic for this movie, supposedly. Bit of a geek. Like sci-fi. Interested in technology and prepared to pay to see good CGI and Avatar totally failed me. Reading some of the rabid comments left for the few professional reviewers brave enough to be actually critical makes me wonder if the studio has launched a viral ""think positive"" campaign to support this movie. Either that, or the lowest common denominator uncritical cud chewing PR swallowing movie going public is a lot more interested & active on blogs and message boards than I had imagined! If the latter then I'll be spending a lot less money on Hollywood over the next decade than I did over the last!",neutral
71,"It's a pretty risky bet but for me is the best film at the visual of the story so far, has set a precedent setting a new level of credibility in the sense of reality and naturalness of 3D being capable of displaying a digital reality as credible as the reality of the real world but there are also limitations that are apparent when the amount of digital creations screen is very high producing some CGIs little expressive and replicated, a perfectly logical thing on the other hand in a technology that has just taken off and the he still has much to develop to get to graze their limitations, the spectacular contrasts found in the faces and amazingly realistic foregrounds. I can not believe how people gives 1 point of qualification. Have seen the movie?",positive
72,"If you are 10 years old this film will probably move you. If you are older and remember movies like ""Broken Arrow"", ""little Big Man"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""A Man called Horse"", then the plot will seem very familiar to you in fact, slightly hackneyed. It's really cowboys and Indians in space. And let's not forget that most of it is a cartoon.It has massive special effects that are impressive. It has great surround sound. It has 3D. 3D is nice but I don't feel that it has reached it's potential yet. I may be in a minority but so far I find 3 D to be inferior to a well directed well photographed normal film.But if you can get past the plot that is so familiar (to adults) as to remove all suspense from the movie then it will be OK. If you take your children to it I am sure they will enjoy it. And it will be a nice diversion for them for a couple of hours.Is it great movie art? Is it a breakthrough? NO. It's ""ok"".",neutral
73,"""Ok, I get it."" That's a phrase I found myself saying an awful lot during this 2 1/2 hour computer game that was as painful to the brain as it was to the eyes.First, let's get the obvious out of the way. This film was expensive, in that it cost so much money to make you could solve at least one state's budget crisis with it. So why did it look like it was nearly all conceived on a computer? Not since the ""Star Wars"" prequels has the ""fourth wall"" ever been so demolished. Never once did I care about the characters or believe anything the actors tried to do because I knew it was completely artificial. Hell, people still complain about ""Waterworld"" being overpriced but at least people actually got off their duffs and did some real film shooting! This whole project stinks of imported bottled water and soy lattes. This film is the pinnacle of Hollywood overkill. An overblown, overpriced, overindulgent eyesore of a movie with a ""message."" Oh yes, the message. Underneath watching the latest in nerd fantasy-fulfillment with its CGI, is a liberal-minded jackhammer drilling into your psyche about the evil of American corporatism, military culture, and rich white men's greed. The noble intent of getting its audience to care about the environment is done in the LSD-esquire rainbow cornucopia of every Native American and African stereotype imaginable, all set to an ""oweyo oweyo"" New Age chorus that makes one actually pine for the sweet sound of the Jonas Brothers. I say this as a die-hard independent who has as much to say about environmental awareness as anyone with a college education, but the caricatures painted here border on MSNBC-levels of leftist philosophy. The bad guys are the Republican racist military and corporate oppressors, who refer to our heroes as ""tree huggers"" and the alien Navi as ""savages,"" and see their violence against them as ""fighting terror with terror."" I'm not kidding, they actually use soundbites from the last decade as part of the script. One character actually refers to the military attacks as ""shock and awe."" If you don't want to heave from the vertigo-inducing sweep of the completely sterile computer-created world of Pandora, the dialog will surely get you to bending over the toilet cursing the day you ever thought this was worth even half its price tag.See, there was a movie made very recently that dealt with valid socio-political issues that was full of interesting characters and top-notch CGI at a fraction of ""Avatar's"" cost. It was called ""District 9"" and if you haven't seen it, do so and then come tell me what you thought of ""Avatar."" Because the former film was able to show the evils of racism without painting its characters as one-dimensional caricatures. It showed that greed knew no color boundaries, and that you can combine action with a message and not be beaten over the head with it.I would advise people to avoid this film, however I know that is next to impossible. This has become the new ""Titanic,"" where seeing it is not only an option, but a requirement with some groups of people. I like to refer to those people as ""STUPID.""",negative
74,"The truth is the bad reviewers of this film, on IMDb, try to pin Avatar to some other movie saying it isn't original. Well I ask, if it isn't original then why cant you place it on one movie. The truth is the Movie Avatar is a mixture of Aliens, Terminator, Titanic, Ferngully(its not a bad thing) and Pocahontas. Not Dances with wolves(beyond boring movie) like so many people have said.Avatar doesn't gross 300 million Dollars in one weekend and then another 300 million the next because its an ""ok film"" its a master piece and James Cameron knows it.I only had one gripe with one character the mining operation leader.10/10 Its a movie you shouldn't miss.",positive
75,"This is the best 3 hours in my life This was my subziest movie ever . Movie,s VFX was awesome And this movie takes you to a different beautiful world. Highly recommended.I LOVE IT.",positive
76,"Watching Avatar felt like watching Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or Star Wars for the first time when I was a kid. Back then I didn't even really realize I was watching a movie, I felt more like one of the characters and a part of the story. Watching Avatar was like that. The 3D technology Cameron has perfected over the years makes you dive into the story so deep, you feel everything more effectively, just like when you were a child. After the movie was over my body was shaking and my heart was bounding from excitement. There's that feeling, that high again, the reason why I love movies above all thing.Avatar is director James Cameron's first film in 12 years after Titanic, which was the most expensive movie of it's time. So true to his grand style Avatar is no exception. It is clear from the start that this movie was very expensive. That being said, Cameron is one of those people who knows how to spend money wisely and in the right places. In this movie the money has gone mostly to CGI. And God knows how much money is spend on enhancing the 3D technology alone. I say money well spent, because Avatar is not only one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, but it is also a major breakthrough in 3D technology. The movie is so beautiful in fact that at times I was moved to near tears just by it's beauty alone.Although Avatar is highly entertaining it is also very anti-war and green. I might even say that the movie has a conscience. I truly admire the highly imaginative world Cameron has created for Avatar. It feels like he has thought of every tiny little thing. It's not every day you get to see a bunch of blue people running around half naked in the jungle and not think it's completely ridiculous. And this is one of those days.I'm not saying that the movie is flawless or that there were no negatives, sure they were. A cynic might even say that Avatar is a movie filled with crazy patriotic soldiers, bad dialog and a bunch of tree huggers. But who cares when you feel like you've just been injected with a doze of the most exquisite movie heroin. The only really negative thing about Avatar is that the movie is not meant to be watched in 2D or from you shitty TV screen, no matter how big it is. I'm already a little sad that I will never be able to see Avatar again, at least not in the right way, unless I go to the theater again.Oh wait, what's that ringing sound? Oh, it's the Oscar bells.",positive
77,"Literally thousands of people have already written reviews about AVATAR - some qualified, some not so qualified - so why would I feel the urge to post my first ever movie review about it? Maybe because it has been the first movie for more than a decade that made me wish to see (or rather: EXPERIENCE) it right again the moment the credits started rolling and the lights went on. Definitely because the overwhelming majority of critical reviews to me seem to be exactly what they accuse AVATAR to be: schematic, one-dimensional, simplified, predictable and with lots of well known content.I agree with those characterizing the story to be simple, predictable and quite an eclectic blend of well known stories, BUT that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not working or even being a bad one. On the contrary, it's simplicity helps the general audience to not get lost along the way and focus on the really new and unique aspects, namely the exposure to a completely unfamiliar environmental and cultural setting. The level of detail Cameron has put into creating this earth-like planet (moon, technically) together with all the flora and fauna hasn't been seen since Tolkien's Middlearth. What makes it even more compelling is that almost every aspect really has a solid and believable scientific foundation. Although fitted with a simple structure, the story never tends to be dumb like in so many other blockbusters, especially those dealing with science-fiction. On the contrary, Cameron manages to pick up quite a lot of current social, political and environmental issues (e.g. ignorance against foreign cultures/civilizations, privatization of warfare, corporate profits before morale and the well being of others) and still makes it entertaining instead of boring.With AVATAR Cameron has proved again that he can not only deliver in terms of action but especially when it comes to telling a simple story in such a way that it's almost impossible to not feel emotionally touched and involved. I've seen this movie several times by now and each time I could feel the same emotional grip all over the audiences, quite a lot leaving the theater with tears in their eyes. Unlike Bay or Emmerich, Cameron has mastered to reach out to a broad audience far beyond the young and predominantly male focus group for action movies and get it to bond with the characters instead of just watching an effects-laden movie.In terms of visual effects AVATAR absolutely is the game changer Cameron had promised it to be. While there have been other movies using 3D lately not one of them succeeded like this one in not using 3D as a mere gimmick but instead as an essential part of the cinematic experience. After a few minutes of adjusting you get completely submerged into the movie and it makes you feel like you are really taking part in an event unfolding around you instead of just watching a pre-recorded performance.Although the use of 3D helped considerably in making this movie a submersing experience it's only second place in terms of technical achievement when you consider the leap forward in creating believable human(oid) CGI characters this movie represents. After being left with more or less creepy feelings watching ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" where the CGI characters had more resemblance to zombies than to living human beings, I was quite skeptical about Cameron's ability to live up to his promises and was blown away when I finally did watch the movie. Especially the close ups in many emotionally touching scenes, where even the tiniest recognizable artificiality of the CGI characters would have ruined everything (e.g. on dying Eytucan after the destruction of the Hometree, Neytiri hiding behind a tree and watching the soldiers closing in on her or Neytiri breaking up in tears after she barely managed to save Jake from suffocation) did deliver on such a great level that I am still in awe. I have watched the close up of Naytiri hiding behind a tree and watching the soldiers closing in on her from the official Trailer in Full HD over and over again and still I can't see any hint on her being a CGI character.A third an not to be underestimated technical innovation that helped a lot in delivering a convincing CGI environment is the virtual camera that was used to capture the performances as if shot with a real camera in the currently so famous hand-held style which added another layer of realism, especially to the action sequences (e.g. Jake getting chased by the Thanator or flying next to Neytiri when she takes her Ikran for a ride around the Hometree).Regarding James Horner's score I do have mixed feelings. It ranges from well done to excellent for most parts of the movie and considerably adds to the emotional impact in many scenes (e.g. the arrival in space at that mystical moon Pandora, the devastation of the Na'vi after the destruction of the Hometree or the fighting montage in slow motion when Tsu'tey and other characters get struck down). However, there are a few instances, especially the mass scenes at the tree of souls, where the music completely fails and even took me out of the whole movie experience back into the real world for a moment because it did annoy me that much. When the Na'vi are gathered around the tree of souls praying it sounds more like a spiritual hippie happening than desperate and displaced indigenous people praying for help. Likewise the music used for both ""transfer"" scenes when the Na'vi are trying to transfer the human souls of Grace and Jake into their avatar bodies didn't help at all and made the scenes rather feel kitschy.",positive
78,"James Cameron's Avatar. Oh the hype, the rumours and the budget.Whilst many saw the dizzying heights Cameron was willing to risk the few of us only saw the inevitable. This film would be a mega blockbuster.But ticket sales alone will not vindicate this movie nor will its budget or any other extravagant claims from Cameron. Truth be told is this film is average at best.For all the bark Cameron makes of making an alien world the use of cgi and humanoid aliens with the pseudo political overtones makes it feel more at home in the star wars universe. The so called groundbreaking effects feel to be in the same vein as new star wars trilogy with a whole world being constructed on the backdrop of green screen and even the movements, colours and gestures seem traceable to those movies. And yet the film has heavy stereotypes of natives like something out of the peter Jackson movies, in an epic 3d landscape with 2d stereotypical portrayals. just about every character in this movie fits the stereotype so much that the plot itself becomes derivative and utterly predictable. So when the preachy new age underlying message tries to appear we are left unmoved and unimpressed. The film itself might as well have been called George Lucas's and Peter Jacksons Avatar in 3d.But people and reviewers are raving about this movie claiming it to be the an artful masterpiece of cinematography. But were you ever in doubt that what you were looking at wasn't real? The CGI still has the unnatural tones and blitzy light so recognisable as computer generated. And the fluid movements and slight gestures still look unconvincing. just look at the earliest use of cgi in the movie for the humans just as the protagonist arrives. It looks nothing more than the opening for a ps3 game. The 3d manifests itself as particles that float between your field of vision rather that of any large moving cgi, this adds more realism and yet it doesn't really justify at revolutionary either based on the scale of its use.And just ask them about the plot and they say the same resounding thing, that it was predicable and then they simply pass that aside.Forgive me for thinking that films with a truly original plot and innovative ideas were what goes into making a good movie. Oh well i suppose because we now have avatar,dancing with wolves isn't as good anymore despite having class acting, beautiful landscapes and a genuinely emotional plot as it lacks cgi, marketing and 3D.But history will ultimately give the final verdict and as technology and cgi improve all you are left with is the story and the idea. And what seems quite clear is that Cameron attempted like many other to push the boundaries and make a foot mark and yet he has not achieved the title first for anything this movie offers.What seems clear from all this is a sad resigning fact of what people expect. They accept the films with no new concepts, big cgi budgets and heavy marketing. They applore the average. Average is indistinct and a waste of time at a running time of over two hours, a mighty one. The people watch what they're told almost to the point of being unthinking for themselves in quality.I would happily accept that it is an average movie but the straw that breaks the camel's back is that it isn't just the masses who support this movie, but even the long time reviewers.It seems everyone has adjusted their bar that much lower and are willing to support the status quo and remain in their comfort zone. The bold and different have been left silenced as the vocal vanguards turn tails.This film is momentous to one horrifically true fact; the stagnation and predictability of Hollywood.",neutral
79,"Avatar, in terms, visuals effects and overall aesthetics, it excels. The fictional world of Pandora is very well done. The many different animals, trees and how they connect with the Na'vis, and the Na'vis themselves are all truly spectacular. The CGI is outstanding. The score and cinematography are also amazing. But The plot is downright predictable and generic. Moreover, it is dragged out to an infuriating length. The characters are introduced well, but none of them are explored further, and the relationships between them lack any kind of complexity and depth.
Overall, Avatar is a visually stunning sci-fi adventure, with good cast performances, amazing score and cinematography but suffers from formulaic story and one-dimensional characters.",neutral
80,"My expectations going to see ""Avatar"" were low. I anticipated a special effects-driven, predictable action movie with little or no story. The visual effects are unquestionably impressive. The art design is beautiful, and the artistic concept for the terrain, flora and fauna of Pandora is consistent and appealing. The story is indeed predictable, at least superficially, sort of an extraterrestrial ""Dances With Wolves"" that may also serve as an allegory for the present-day US military and, especially, mercenary presence in the Middle East. But these things alone didn't make ""Avatar"" a box-office smash.Director James Cameron utilizes long-time collaborator Sigourney Weaver to give the cast a credible, old-school science fiction foundation. As ever, Weaver delivers a solid and believable performance as Dr. Grace Augustine, the hardened and pragmatic chain-smoking scientist in charge of the Avatar project. The counterpoint to Weaver's Grace is relative newcomer Sam Worthington's Jake Sully. Worthington is recognizable to science fiction fans as the protagonist of the most recent Terminator movie. Jake Sully is a marine, the antithesis of a scientist.With a damaged spine, Jake is confined to a wheelchair and can not afford corrective surgery. He agreed to come to Pandora with his twin brother, who was to participate in the Avatar project -- have his mind linked by machinery to a Pandora-indigenous humanoid body grown in a test tube and matched to his DNA. Jake's brother is killed before the film begins, and Jake agrees to takes his place (as they have identical DNA). Jake has really given up hope before the film begins. He can no longer be the only thing he has ever known or wanted to be: a marine.Jake has, however, taken a step outside his cynicism and ennui by making the decision to take his brother's place -- he has agreed to enter into the unknown. This is the first step in what is to become the journey that defines him and is the real story in the film.Humans are on Pandora to mine Unobtanium, a mineral concentrated underneath the home of the indigenous people, the Na'vi. The Avatar project was developed to allow humans to establish relationships with the Na'vi, breathing Pandoran air and looking like the Na'vi. It is hoped that the Na'vi will eventually agree to relocate in order to allow mining to begin. The corporate head of the mining project, portrayed effectively by Giovani Ribisi, is reminiscent of Paul Reiser's Carter Burke in Cameron's 1986 ""Aliens"" -- a wimpy minor bureaucrat bent on personal gain. He is assisted by the unscrupulous ex-Marine mercenary Colonel Miles Quaritch, given life by Stephen Lang.Jake becomes involved with Na'vi native Neytiri, wonderfully voiced by Zoe Saldana, whose work in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films and ""Star Trek"" (2009) have already made her a familiar and respected actor. Neytiri is charged with teaching Jake the ways of the Na'vi, and Jake inevitably becomes enthralled with both Neytiri and the ways of the Na'vi, as he begins to understand the spiritual connection the Na'vi have with Pandora. This leads to war between the humans and the Na'vi, with Jake caught in the middle, ultimately choosing the Na'vi side.I had fully expected all of this going into the theater. What I had not expected was finding my heart in my throat more than once, and feeling exhilarated most of the film's very quick 162 minutes. I was more than entertained by ""Avatar."" I was moved.Cameron masterfully uses stunning visual effects and incredible music as devices to achieve this effect on the viewer, but by themselves, these ingredients (although perhaps necessary) are not sufficient. What moved me was the transformation of Jake Sully.Jake's decision to go Pandora is his first step toward becoming something more than he was (his openness to possibility is a step toward hope). He embraces the Na'vi training and is determined to prove himself -- another step (courage, determination, and willingness to become part of something larger than himself, which is a definition of spirituality). He admits his complicity in the plot against the Na'vi -- a third step (integrity). He realizes that he must do something extraordinary to win back the trust of the Na'vi -- riding the terrifying great dragon -- and this is a crucial step (not only bravery, but insight, which is translated into action, and faith). Ultimately, Jake is literally transformed, permanently departing his human body to become Na'vi. He becomes physically and spiritually integrated with the life force of Pandora.Jake's transformation is assisted and encouraged by Neytiri. After Jake regains the trust of the Na'vi, Neytiri acknowledges this by saying ""I see you."" Significantly, she repeats this later in the film, looking into Jake's human eyes. For the Na'vi, ""I see you"" means ""I acknowledge your existence."" The real meaning for Jake is that Neytiri sees him for who he really is, and more importantly, who he can become. It is no coincidence that the song at the end of the film is called ""I See You.""The transformation illustrated so literally in ""Avatar"" is what each of us seeks in life -- a hopeful journey forward, through which we become more than what we were. The journey can be exciting, terrifying, and at times, can challenge us to go beyond what we believed we were capable of doing. Cameron's real achievement in ""Avatar"" is communicating that message without letting the audience know that he is doing it.Especially at this time in history, with the economy depressed, world politics ominous and uncertain, and opportunities for the young seemingly absent, ""Avatar"" delivers a message of encouragement and hope in a medium familiar and acceptable to young adults. For this, Cameron deserves more than an Academy Award. He deserves the Nobel Prize.",positive
81,"Well, after all the hype - and a chance to see this for free on a Blu-Ray disc - it was an offer I couldn't refuse. In the end, and even though it's a long film (2 hrs, 40 minutes) I watched it all and wasn't surprised at much of anything story-wise. Like a lot of modern-day action films, they start off great but slowly become unraveled and during the last third of movie, you have to totally ""check your brains at the door,"" but this movie, overall, was fun to watch.For much of it, there were enough visual wonders in here, fantastic colors and special-effects to make up for Director/writer James Cameron's usual Liberal political bias and stereotypical characters. In many respects, you've seen this story before a number of times. In fact, if you've seen ""Dances With Wolves,"" you've seen ""Avatar,"" the main difference being the setting: instead of the Old West you have a futuristic planet. The story is basically the same, the one filmmakers love to present: the evil white military-like corporation men invade the peaceful natives for greed and profit.... and troubles ensue. Throw in the ""mixed"" romance you saw in ""Dances With Wolves"" and you have a good chunk of this story. Very little has changed except for the futuristic eye candy. Instead of the American Indian, we have the ""Na'vi,"" which are portrayed in a very similar light except for the blue skin, of course.The only creativity in this film is in the special-effects department, but - wow - what creativity! The visuals are the attraction to this movie, pure and simple. The amazing jungle scenery, bizarre bird creatures and illuminating small objects everywhere will dazzle you, especially played through a Blu-Ray disc and big HD set. The transfer is as sharp as any you'll see.",positive
82,"Without a doubt, this was the single most amazing display of movie making that I or my family have ever watched. For all of you out there criticizing this movie because of the cartoonish characitures, or the simplistic plot, or the liberal pontification; you are completely missing the boat. You literally cannot see the forest for the trees.I will admit, entering the movie I was trepidatious over the reported 3 hour running time, but the movie flew by quicker than many 90 minute yawners. We will be going to see it again in a couple of weeks.The cool factor was off the charts. The visual stimulation from seeing it in 3D was something I'd never experienced at the movies before. The movie enveloped me and washed over me. I felt as though I was on Pandora. Incredible.Yes the imperialists were cartoonish, but they often are in real life too. The plot was simple, but that simplicity enable the viewer to focus on everything else that was going on.The word I kept repeating for hours afterwards was ""Amazing"". This is the first movie that I've given a ""10"" rating on my vote.My wife and my 11 year old son agree, you absolutely owe it to yourself to go see this movie. You won't be sorry you did.",positive
83,"This is no doubt a great piece of cinema. The visuals are gorgeous and the effects are incredible and on a whole, this is by far worth the admission price.That being said, the plot is thin and the characters are thinner. The foreshadowing is often shoved in your face and there is little exploration into what could have been wonderfully unique characters. Essentially, the plot is the Last Samurai on a distant planet. The characters are stuck somewhere between honoring Native American culture and insulting it.If this were just some run of the mill Hollywood flick, those things would be easy to overlook--or at least forgivable. In a movie that was over a decade in the making, costing more than almost any other film, and introducing such glorious cinema, it's just a real shame that everything to do with the script was so carelessly put together.Again, see it. If these things don't bother you, you are very lucky and will end up having one of the best cinematic experiences of your life. If they do bother you, you'll nonetheless love the ride. But don't believe the reviews that don't see past the imagery. There's more to film than that.",neutral
84,"Really how did it?The story is paper thin and pathetic. ""Unobtainium"". Really? That's the best you could come up with James Cameron? Why didn't you call your explosives ""kaboomium.""All I have heard anyone say about this film is how great the cinematography for this movie was. Fine. I'm not arguing the cinematography, but the rest of the movie is total piece of crap. It's 2 hours and 15 minutes of a live action version of Fern Gully followed by a 25 minute battle scene that by the time you actually get to that you don't even care because you're so viciously bored that your eyes are bleeding.I can think of dozens of movies that had great cinematography that didn't come close to grossing what this piece of crap did. Then the DVD comes out and all people say is that what really made Avatar great was the 3D. Well, the DVD isn't in 3D so why are you buying it?The raters on this website have Avatar rated as a better movie than; The Wizard of Oz, Ben Hur, Toy Story 1 & 2, The Graduate, Duck Soup, Scarface, Rocky (which I'm not a big fan, but it's still a much better movie than this piece of crap), Spartacus, and on and on and on. That's insanity. Yeah 8 more minutes of this movie? Are you trying to make it worse? Is that even possible? I went into seeing this movie with absolutely no expectations and it didn't even exceed that. Everyone I know loves it and no one can give me a single reason why other than it looked good. There is absolutely no story to this movie whatsoever! How are people giving it a 10 based solely on cinematography? It shouldn't be given higher than a 3 based on solely cinematography. Then you factor it lacks everything else from story to decent acting and you can give it a 1.How embarrassing that this piece of garbage is rated this high on this website. Notice how it didn't win any Oscar outside of the visual category. It didn't even win best movie from the academy of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror film for crying out loud. 8.3? This should have a rating of 1.3.",negative
85,"It was Terminator in the 1980's and then Titanic in the '90s and it's definitely Avatar in the 2000s!!James Cameron is my most favourite director and he has once again broken all boundaries and created a visual extravaganza.Avatar is Cameron's latest magnum opus is probably one of the most anticipated movies since Titanic and now it seems that the visionary director has indeed created a film that'll revolutionise the world of cinema.The movie is set in the year 2154 and is about a man called Jake who can't walk and he is selected in the Avatar program where he has to go to Pandora jungle which is not a planet but it is one of the three giant gasses that is about 4 light years away from earth. On Pandora there are life forms such as the navis that are about 10 feet tall have sparkly blue skin, big eyes and tails. The humans have genetically bred human-navi hybrids known as Avatars. Jake is able to walk but falls in love with a female navi and now he has to choose the side between humans or the navis.The film was absolutely fascinating, interesting, entertaining and emotional. I loved the look on the Pandora jungle and it must be the best scenery in film history and the navis are definitely the best digital characters since Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The special effects are so amazing that Pandora looks like a real location and you can mistake the navis as real characters. Avatar was almost 3 hours but it didn't seem that long.Avatar already makes it on my top 5 favourite movies and I intend to see it again and I am already waiting for it to release on Blu Ray because I'm sure that it will be one of the best Blu Ray titles.",positive
86,"The King of the World has returned! Mr. James Cameron's youngest ""Avatar"" is a mind-blowing adventure and the most impressive and intricate work of art, I've ever seen.When his twin brother is killed, disabled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited to aid a mining expedition on the distant jungle moon of Pandora as only his DNA will bond with the alien hybrid body, known as an Avatar, that allows humans to breathe the toxic air. With orders to infiltrate the Na'vi, Jake finds himself falling in love with native girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).""Avatar'"" was created twelve years ago by Cameron, but was ahead of its time. Cameron had to shelve the project and wait for technology to catch up to the script he had written. In 2005 Cameron thought he was close enough to push the technology to tell the story he always wanted to tell and went back to work. It cost Jim blood, sweat and tears and of course a lot of money, but the result is just fascinating, mesmerizing. Money well spent.I am really happy that the movie turned out great. Not just for Jim's sake or because it had been a while since I'd seen a really good movie, but because of all the ""Avatar"" haters out there. All of those people who were trashing the movie before even watching it. They didn't give the movie a chance and let everyone believe that the movie was going to be really bad.Well, they were all wrong and I hope they are honest enough to admit that. OK, maybe the love story wasn't really original, but it worked. However, if the story doesn't work for you, everything else will make up for it. When you watch the movie in 3D it becomes a transcendent and amazing experience that's the closest you will ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. The length of the movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes, but it looked a lot shorter. I wanted more. I just didn't want it to stop. It was that good.I advise them and everyone to give the movie a chance and watch it the way it was mend to be watched, in 3D. You won't regret it!Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When you're watching the movie, it's completely normal to be attracted to Neytiri  Right? Heck even Jim says he's attracted to the Na'vi creatures!",positive
87,"For all its visual proficiency, ""Avatar"" is not the apex of cinematic achievement some reviewers would have you believe it is, and the primary reason is this: the wobbly script is about as old as cinema itself -- the abundance of flat dialogue like ""You're not the only one with a gun, bitch"" doesn't help either. For this reason (and others discussed below) I still rank Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as superior to ""Avatar"" -- Cameron's film may be technologically superior, but it lacks the intelligence and subtle emotion of Jackson's expertly crafted cinematic trio.""Avatar"" is filled with familiar characters, from the rebellious outsider and hero Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) to noble human scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) to a cartoonish villain (Stephen Lang) invoking the imperialist bloodlust of Bush Cheney Co. to the wise and peaceful Na'vi chief (Wes Studi) and shaman (C.C.H. Pounder) who happen to be parents to the Na'vi princess, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).Neytiri is the sole standout among the film's characterizations as aspiring to something more than cliché: she is not cast simply as Jake's mandatory love interest or the raison d'etre for the switching of his loyalties. She is a fierce warrior, a defender of the environment, and a potent force of nature whose love and life are at the center of the film. The film makers spared no effort in crafting her as authentically as possible; there are moments (i.e. the destruction of the Great Tree, her animalistic cries over the body of her father) when she seems more real (even more human?) than the human characters, which is testimony to the fact that she is the greatest technological achievement in a film boasting of literally millions of special effects and synthetic manipulations. Indeed, when all else about the film may be forgotten, it is her image which persists in the memory, so powerfully is she depicted.It is difficult to watch the onslaught of attacks on the Na'vi without thinking of how closely this scene of unadulterated horror and depraved violence resembles what the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam have endured throughout the U.S. led invasions of those nations. It is clear that Cameron views those invasions as immoral and evil. Should there be any doubts, he has his villain proclaim his desire for ""preemptive attack"" by fighting ""terror with terror."" I wonder what arch conservative Rupert Murdoch (whose Fox produced ""Avatar"") thinks of this not-so-subtle bit of Bush bashing . . .It is impossible -- yes, impossible -- to view the film without thinking of real, historical, flesh and blood Native Americans who lived in North America long before Jamestown was ever a colony. The Na'vi of Pandora are the Native Americans of the 16th and 17th centuries, complete from their tribal lifestyle to the markings on their bodies.To be sure, there is much in ""Avatar"" that borrows from earlier films about Native Americans, namely Disney's animated musical ""Pocahontas"" and the Kevin Costner epic ""Dances with Wolves"". Neytiri IS Pocahontas, and if Jake isn't John Smith, he is most definitely John J. Dunbar/Dances With Wolves. The dominant themes of environmental oneness, natural spirits, and kinship with all of creation abound in stark contrast with the ""human"" values of greed, war, and destruction. Cameron even managed to reincarnate Grandmother Willow as a divine tree called Eywah.The film also delves into the issues of race, genocide, and manifest destiny (admittedly, not always with subtlety or sophistication) in ways that many will decry the film as blatant anti-American propaganda, or as some have described it, as a liberal apology for genocide inflicted upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas by Europeans fueled by white guilt and a visceral hatred of all things neocon. Clearly, much more unfolds on the screen than simply the greatest collection of cinematic visuals you've ever seen.Thus the question naturally arises, is this the definitive mainstream Hollywood film about Native Americans and what they endured under siege of the settlers in the founding years of America? The truth is I do not know. But if what is essentially a popcorn blockbuster can encourage the average film-goer to reassess how they view their place in the natural world and what it really means to invade another nation and unleash war, then Cameron will have far exceeded his goals. What I do know is that ""Avatar"" is an AMAZING piece of entertainment (cheesy dialogue, superficial characterizations and all). You've never seen anything like it -- and likely won't for a long, long time. A definite must-see.",positive
88,"It was a great looking film.Aliens were tall and regal.Alien plants exotic and luminescent. Alien wild life, a strange mutation of creatures we have on earth, except much more dangerous and spectacularly primal.Thus ends the good review portion of this write up.The rest of the film however... was less than stunning.We have a hero without much personality - wheelchair bound - unemotional, and demonstrates this when he doesn't even mourn the death of his twin brother for one second. Yes. This is literal not metaphorical. Try counting the moments where this hero actually has real emotions for his own flesh and blood. And yet later in the film, he is supposed to be in touch with the planet he now inhabits. As a cheat, the film suggests his rivers run deep. Telling us he is some kind of deeply spiritual being. All this is well and good, however he has very little empathy for others around him. He is wide eyed and naive at best and at his worst is simply unintelligent and reactive. Not exactly the picture of enlightenment he is purported to being. What is insulting to the intelligence is how our human hero goes on to being the savior of the native aliens towards the end of the film. Somehow, he is the one chosen to deliver these already intuitive and spiritual beings from their own naivety and lack of combat strategy skills. On top of which, he gets the biggest dragon too. So all in all, the film shows us he becomes the best alien, when only half an hour ago he was a lumbering clumsy buffoon. Miraculously he masters their language in record time, is more agile than his other human colleagues who have been training for years. In other words, he was born to be an alien.So, let's say we the audience buy into this. Other contradictions appear to destroy the illusion of a perfect transformation from human soul to alien spirit. This comes in the form of connection. When the chief of the alien tribe is killed... he continues his insensitive ways and does not shed a single tear. This, coming from the most connected alien in the whole bunch. The final insult of course comes in the form of his superiority over them all when he single handedly tames the biggest dragon in the sky. This preadolescent fantasy of bigger is better, and that ""I'm more enlightened than everyone and I don't even know how I did it"" is not an act of profundity, it's an act of suspending disbelief to the extent that we must be numb in the brain to not see this person is a callous immature person who does not deserve such high praises. A young unwise boy trapped in the body of an adult, trapped in a machine sending neural impulses to a electro-chemically remote controlled alien body trapped in a plot line involving mineral mining espionage which included a cigar chomping mercenary commanding officer and greedy corporate middle management stereotype. At its centre, the story is the imaginings of a child, stumbling around thinking he's a man, having sex with exotic beings and fighting and having fun with violence and explosions and crazy visually stunning landscapes. A perfect film for anyone with a mental age of 12 or below.Emotionally hollow, I can understand the fascination with this much hyped visual feast. Essentially it shows, we are superficial as a collective, unable to go past the eye's delight and can be manipulated into feeling something that isn't there if the images are able to tap into our subconscious yearnings. (We yearn to be thin, tall and agile; good looking and strong; we want to have sex with the alpha male or female and ride flying dragons; we want to be deeply connected to our environment without having to do any studying, reading and personal observation; and most of all we want to be loved by everyone, including creatures great and small who respect and even obey us. I remember having some of these very same fantasies at age 8. And before anyone thinks I have something against staying youthful, I don't. Being 8 is great, but at some stage, other people's feelings become important too. And if this film suffers from any one dilemma of a child's perspective, it is the flaw of being ultimately self centred and self serving. There is only one winner and it is that naive, good looking human who wanted to be respected and loved by everyone.)That said, I commend all the artists who worked on this film. They did an outstanding job at creating some of the most eye catching big screen images in recent years.",neutral
89,"Unfortunately, I had to watch it in 2D, but even with that, this movie was just brilliant. I think we all know the basic outline of the story by now, and I admit, some of the movie's flaws is that the plot is somewhat predictable, and that it had some cliché moments and some cheesy dialogue, but nevertheless, I thought the movie was overall fantastic. We all know the SFX are the best ever (everyone pretty much has said that, so why bother?), but what you don't know is that the way the film is executed actually carries quite an emotional punch that most people won't be expecting, and all of the performances overall are great, even Worthington's (which is the first film I've seen him in, by the way. Never got the chance to watch Terminator: Salvation, so he was a relatively new actor to me), but I can easily say that Zoe Saldaña was the best one, which brings me to my next point, and what I think is the highlight of the film: the na'vi. If you thought Gollum in the LotR films or the prawns in District 9 were incredible in how much emotion and realism they conveyed, just you wait 'till you see this film's blue humanoids. They're, without a shadow of a doubt, the best-looking CG characters I've ever seen. Not only do they LOOK real, they FELT real, and after a few minutes in, one could easily forget they were all actors in motion-capture suits. The na'vi showed more emotion, more expression and simply just more life than what most live-action actors have today. I hope the Academy Awards consider motion-capture performances from hereon out in the Acting categories, because they were just outstanding in this movie, and WAY better than most live-action performances we get today. And the action, of course, was also fantastic. Cameron just proved to people like Michael Bay that the King is back. Not just the battle scenes, but even some parts that were just, say, some characters flying around on their banshees were just a beauty to look at, since all shots just show how amazing the incredibly deep and detailed world that Pandora is. To the senses, it's the most stunning film I've ever seen. As for story and dialogue writing, it could've been better, it's not perfect, but this movie's really about how the story is executed rather than the content. Another highlight for me is, of course, just how deep and detailed everything in this film was, and being an artist myself, you could easily imagine just what an assault on the senses it was for me to witness such a beautifully created world that is Pandora. Ranging from its flora to its fauna, all things in this world are indeed alien, but also have a familiar sense to them from our world. One who's been watching Cameron for the past few years would know that he's always been into deep underwater exploration, and you can easily tell that a lot of what he saw down there influenced his vision for many of the things we see in this lush beauty of an ever-stretching rainforest.As for the film's score, I really don't get why some people are getting upset about it. In my opinion, James Horner gave us a tremendous score that fit perfectly to whatever was happening during the film. And yes, I even like Leona Lewis' song in the end credits.Many filmmakers out there think about CG effects and put no depth into the narrative or story, but that's not the case with Cameron. In this film, the special effects MAKE the story. He puts special effects and story in a blender, and meshes these elements up so well that what we get is one of the most unique films in history. My score: 8.5/10, and I think I'd probably give it a 9.0/10 or higher if I had seen it in 3D, and definitely a perfect 10 if I had seen it in an Imax 3D screen with the best seat in the hall, but then, we wouldn't really be speaking in that case about a movie, and instead a full-on cinematic experience, which is what makes me think that Avatar will become a classic; it's more an experience than a film, it's a journey to a new world where our imaginations are tested, and has achieved perfectly what a movie is intended for in the first place, at least of this genre: pure, out-of- this-world escapism.",positive
90,"Seriously: 1. The soundtrack - Pretty standard 'epic-jaw-dropping-orchestra' fare, nothing particularly new here.2. The effects - OK. Let's be clear: I'm a professional Software Engineer with a hand in computer graphics (specifically, high end visualization of geological volumes) so I've made a lot of pretty pictures myself, and know how a lot of Avatar was made. I've seen a lot of CG, some of it good, a lot of it bad.The effects in this movie are nice, and large parts of this movie are basically render porn, specifically some of the volumetric effects (the water, smoke, dust), some of it isn't that impressive (some of the surfaces just look downright plastic, particularly that huge gunship thing), and some of it REALLY isn't that impressive (external shots of the spaceships at the start made me cringe).If we look at it as a matter of scale, this movie is hardly ground breaking: For $237,000,000 you can buy a LOT of computing power. Throw enough money, time and manpower at any computing problem and you'll get something purdy.If you want to talk about pioneers, read about the founder of Pixar, Edwin Catmull; he is one of the guys who made hard things easy. This movie looked nice, but it DID cost $237,000,000 so if it did look crummy, someone would have probably been kneecapped.3. The 3D - 3D isn't new, I don't know why people are so excited. The process they used is a good many years old, and has been used for far less hyped movies. At the start of this movie I went 'wow, this is interesting' and about 10 minutes later I stopped caring, like everyone else I saw this movie with. Kudos though for not making half the audience vomit with nausea.4. The storyline - I just read that James Cameron wrote the script in two weeks. I wonder if he wrote if after watching Fern Gully? The storyline has a pretty heavy liberal bias, 'military bad, environment good, let's all hug a tree' type stuff, been there done that. It's neither particularly insightful of thought provoking; if you believe this stuff you'll swallow it whole, if you hate it you'll really hate it, and if you're after something thought provoking (duality of man), you'll be left severely disappointed.The other problem I had was that at times the need for visual spectacle overtook both storytelling and pacing in priority, a large portion of Avatar feels like a a tech demo. I've sat through enough tech demos to know when I'm watching a finely tuned fly though of a rendered scene to show off all the sub-surface light scattering and how well the volumetric effects handle the 200 light sources. subtract some of the rather protracted visual scenes and there could have been some decent dialog, and perhaps even an original storyline. I count this as a missed opportunity.5. Etc - I got a cool pair of glasses.In summary, this movie cost $237,000,000, and it's pure spectacle. The soundtrack is forgettable, the storyline would get you a C+ in junior high school (or accused of plagiarism, have you seen Pocahontas?), and a lot of the visuals feel contrived to the point of a tech demo. It's not completely bad, but it's not spectacularly good. I did get to keep those 3D glasses though.I think it's a C+ at most.",neutral
91,"I've seen a great many movies in five decades of life in this ""age of media"", and I've seen quite a pile of IMAX 3D features as well. Within the latter domain, this movie is really nothing special. I mean, yeah, it's VERY cool if you've never seen live-action IMAX 3D before. All around me during the screening I could hear the new initiates in the audience experiencing the giddy delight that strikes so many of us on our ""first time."" But what was very apparent to me as a seasoned IMAX aficionado was the difference between the live-action scenes and computer-generated ones. Though still spectacular by virtue of the sheer screen size, CGI 3D still has a long way to go to rival what IMAX cameras can do.That said, the tale itself is simply wonderful. Yes, as other reviewers have remarked, it's an old and well-worn storyline. But then, as many film reviewers have pointed out time and again, there are really only a couple of dozen different basic story lines in existence to begin with, so if you've been around the block a few times as I have, they all look pretty familiar in one way or another. However, what sets Avatar apart is that it an essential parable for our times . . . and if you are TRULY willing to look and listen, you will find it resonating within you at a level that goes far, far beyond the messaging of messaging of even the best of Hollywood's standard film-fare. Cameron has a way of reaching to an emotional depth in the sapient viewer's soul that nobody else in cinema comes close to. And upon this power he overlays a subtle yet vital message to which we simply must pay attention. For that reason alone, Avatar is an absolute must-see for all.",positive
92,"Simply put, Avatar is an epic. For it's 2 & a half hour run time, I sat mesmerized, until my eyes watered and I realized I wasn't blinking. By the time it was over, I had a headache as a result of over stimulation. Now I feel like I need to wind down and watch something like Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero to feel normal again.Avatar is a spectacle film, with a lot of action and visuals. The story is simple and the anti-war message is very obvious. But in the long run, you get a compelling movie out of it that gains momentum all the way into its final act.James Cameron always manages to get his actors to seem natural. You believe the characters, because the dialogue is not overwritten. My favorite is Stephen Lang who plays a Colonel who's hellbent on pillaging the alien world. He ranks up with one of the greatest villains I've seen in recent times.This was the first major 3D movie I saw. It didn't use any gimmicks. Usually, you would expect objects to fly straight into your face, but instead it used the 3D as a depth of field to see into the screen and immerse yourself in the environment. I felt like I was there.History has repeated itself. In the 1950's, 3D and lavish color widescreen ""Cinemascope"" epics enticed people away from their Televisions, to get off their asses and come back to the theater. Today, the convenience of Netflix, downloading movies, DVR, and movies coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray within a few months of their theatrical release, for little over the same cost, loaded with extras, it makes you wonder why go to the theater at all. But the answer is here. Avatar made me glad to leave my house and saved the movie-going experience.",positive
93,"I simply cannot believe how over-zealous the users of this site are. Actually i can. It was exactly the same for There Will be Blood and every other hyped film there has been recently. Some of the adjectives used to describe Avatar beggar belief: 'The Best Movie of All Time' 'A Masterpiece' 'Mesmorising, Spellbinding, Extraordinary!'. I really do wish i could agree. I was looking forward to this as much as most and i'm a huge fan of Cameron's previous work. Avatar, however, is a massive disappointment, and i'm convinced once the hype surrounding the technology and CGI dies down people will realise that. It really is a reflection of the times that people can be so suckered in by fancy visuals and things blowing up. Please, for a moment, look at the merits of this film, CGI aside, and you'll see that they are pretty much on par with a hundred previous sci-fi b-movies/TV-series. The story is completely derivative, the action unrealistic, the dialogue.....oh God, don't get me started. James Cameron has obviously been spending far too much time with George Lucas. The dialogue is atrocious and painfully clichéd. There is no convincing character development at all. I can barely remember any of their names let alone have any sort of affinity with them. Sam Worthington is a waste of space. I don't know what this Hollywood fixation is with him, but he was terrible in Terminator Salvation and he is terrible in this. The cartoon, morally-vacant human 'baddies' are an insult to intelligence and unbelievable at every turn. The entire plot is 100% predictable. Of course we knew the humans weren't go to win. Of course not. Not with their space-travelling, cryo-genetic-using, high-tech weaponary-toting mentality. They didn't understand the forest, man. Please. This is almost as laughable as Return of the Jedi. And the lame efforts to instill some sort of sentimentality and moral message through the use of poorly-written pseudo-spiritual crap just made me cringe. I wasn't even that impressed with the character design. Cameron has basically taken Native American Indians and Antipodean Aborigines and turned them blue. They have similar attire, ride 'horses', shoot arrows etc etc. It was just all too familiar.Avatar may well be a technological breakthrough, and i look forward to others who take the technology on and remember to actually pair it with an original and compelling story, but for now though, this film is a bulging case of style over substance if ever there has been one.I miss Aliens. Now that was a convincing movie.4/10",neutral
94,"I went today with my husband and two sons simply because I didn't want to be left out. After all, I thought it was just a bunch of blue aliens jumping and flying around. I also do not enjoy wearing the 3-D glasses as they give me a headache. Then I saw that it was 2 hours and 40 minutes of wearing those glasses and watching blue aliens. Needless to say, I had extremely low expectations. I'm not one of the people that has been following and anticipating this movie for years.As it so happened, I absolutely was mesmerized by this movie. I loved the plot. I'm sitting there thinking someone had to have been on crack to come up with the world of Pandora due to how creative it was. I really want to go there and fly on those dragon-like things. I thought the transformation of Jake was so cool. The 3-D effects were amazing, but I would have definitely enjoyed this movie without it.In fact, I have only seen one other movie more than once in the theatre and it was Titanic...another James Cameron movie. I can tell you that I will see this one again and I can hardly wait to buy the Blue-Ray disk and see all the extras on how they made the movie. That will be awesome!",positive
95,"James Cameron has never directed a bad - or even mediocre - motion picture; this is the guy who has brought us such classics as the first two Terminators, Aliens - one of the best sequels of all time -, True Lies - exceptional action movie - and, of course, Titanic. That's why, despite some negative buzz, I was always pretty sure his latest endeavor, Avatar, was going to be something else. Maybe not a ""game changer"", as many - including Cameron himself - have been saying, but certainly something that we haven't seen before.Well, I still am not sure if this is a ""game changer"", but it certainly is ""something else.""Avatar is the most visually impressive and most immersive motion picture I've seen in some time. Not since Peter Jackson released the last of the Lord of the Rings movies has someone marveled me in such an amazing way, transporting me into a different land where - apparently - anything is possible. So maybe the story Cameron is telling is not 100% original, but the way in which he tells it certainly is. I haven't seen the movie in 3D - I will on Saturday and a review will follow - and I imagine it must be impressive, but even while watching it on 2D I can't imagine anyone not being marveled and feel inspired by what Cameron has created. This is one epic, epic film - an event and an experience unlike anything I've seen this year.Performances are quite solid. The real scene-stealer is Stephen Lang, whose Quaritch is one of the most effective villains I've seen in some time. We know he is the villain not only because the screenplay tells us so, but because Lang makes the character his own, a real sonofabitch who knows no compassion and no mercy. He never goes over-the-top and avoids turning his character into a caricature. (Although he is larger-than-life.) Sam Worthington is pretty good as Jake Sully - although his ""American"" accent is less-than-stellar - and Sigourney Weaver is memorable as Dr. Augustine. On the other hand, Zoe Saldana has a tougher job - Weaver and Worthington appear both in human and Na'avi form, but Saldana's character appears only as the former. No problem, though - her performance - with the aid of performance capture - is strong enough to make the audience believe in her. Like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings pictures, the audience believe in the Na'avi - we believe they are real characters who breath, cry, laugh and can even die, not just a bunch of pretty-looking cartoons.But what about the spectacle? Despite all the drama and the romance, Cameron has actually managed to deliver action-wise - if there is someone in Hollywood who truly knows how to portray the right balance between action, special effects, character development and story, it is Cameron. Simply put, the film is breath-taking. Despite being approximately 60% CGI, there was never a moment in which I was aware that I was watching big, powerful computers at work. There isn't one - not a single one - fake-looking shot. Pandora is simply beautiful, and all the creatures - including of course the Na'avi - are amazing and totally believable. The way Cameron has populated his world is, simply put, worthy of applause - every single plant, creature, monster, predator, everything is credible and awesome-looking, showing that Cameron is talented at both creating great stories and characters and using his vivid, visual and fantasy-based imagination.And there is the difference between a masterpiece like Avatar and a mindless product like Transformers 2: the viewer actually believes in all the computer-generated creatures, characters and locations, accepting them as real and believing they actually exist, even when they appear on-screen at the same time with flesh-and-blood characters. Unlike the soul-less Michael Bay movie, Avatar has spirit and charm, and never bores. Yes, there is action, but it is not mindless because there are incredibly high stakes at hand, and because we feel for the characters. There are a lot of ridiculously tense moments in Avatar because of this - on the other hand, I didn't even flinch while watching Transformers 2. (And if I did, it was because the action scenes were almost incomprehensible.)Since I haven't seen the film on 3D, I really don't know if Avatar truly is a ""game-changer"" or not. Why I do know, though, is that the movie is one of the most imaginative, visually-arresting and gripping motion pictures I've seen in years, and quite possibly the best film I've seen this 2009. Avatar is not simply a ""movie"" - it is a experience, something that quite literally has to be seen to be believed. It boasts a smart screenplay, it has believable and sympathetic characters, it's got the most believable and awe-inspiring special effects ever seen on the big screen, and it contains more thrills and emotions that any other film this year. I don't care that Cameron took 12 years to make this film - the final product was definitely worth the wait. I just hope that all the rumours that say Cameron plans to shoot a sequel are actually true. This is one rare case in which I just wish a second installment is actually released. (Hopefully, it won't take 12 more years.)",positive
96,"I've always enjoyed this film, following the release of the trailer for the second avatar film I decided to give this a rewatch to see if it has 'aged' like many CG heavy films do after 5-10 years and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up.There are certain shadows, textures & lighting which look a bit old now but the rest is still stunning to look at.From a story point of view this is one of my favourite type of films with the big action set piece & the underdog coming out on top. I really enjoy the world building.My main critique of this film is the rushed ending, it feels as though the last 30 minutes some BIG things happen that would impact our characters but this is heavily glossed over which I believe can be put down to the runtime.Overall I give this film a 9 because of the quality of the film craft, the beautiful soundtrack and the story isn't 'bad' just rushed at the end. There is also great rewatch ability to this film which helps its rating. I'm hyped for the new film!",positive
97,"Avatar is a movie about two races, usually covering both the human and another race on another planet. Its simply outstanding, it has a plot, it has a structure, it has effects that are done so excellently, you'd definitely imagine yourself in the movie. Learning how to talk, learning how to feel nature, learning how to fly and heroic love, all of these are all present.Loved it, loved it, simply loved it.The cast is simply mixed but appropriate. The lady from aliens plus some new talents add to the already excellent finished product.The musical score is simply beholding. You get into the music and it rocks the whole time you are in the theater.Overall, and for all of the above facts, I give it a 10 vote!",positive
98,"12 years ago, James Cameron had a vision of Avatar in mind. A vision so ahead of its time that Cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up. A vision so imaginative & exciting that he, finally, went on to create the much needed technology on his own. And the end result was NOT disappointing at all. Avatar takes film-making technology to a whole new level & sets a new standard in 3D viewing. It's a milestone in the history of the art.Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders & protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism & biodiversity. Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. So, watch it in 3D cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of Cameron's world.Director James Cameron has, once again, broken all boundaries & created a visual extravaganza, thus, in the process, announcing his return which just couldn't have been better. From Terminator to Aliens to The Abyss to Terminator 2 to Titanic & now Avatar, the entertainment scope is getting wider & wider with every Cameron's film without compromising at all with the quality. The attention he has given to the detail is superb. Not only Cameron created a whole new world with its flora & fauna of exceptional beauty, he went on to create the culture, race & language of the Na'vi too & their love for their surroundings. They are to Pandora what humans are to Earth. Only difference being our ignorance to our surroundings.Avatar isn't an exceptional movie, overall. When it comes to plot, performances or dialogs, its a disappointment. Those things are no match to Cameron's previous works; Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2 & even Titanic. The reason behind Avatar breaking every box-office records lies in the beauty of Avatar that's drawing people to theaters again & again. The unforgettable experience in 3D viewing, the dead-end beauty of Pandora, the never-seen-before film-making technology & much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success. It has started the change. It has set things in motion. Cinema is getting revolutionized. Almost every movie is going 3D these days because of Avatar. Still, none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience. That's why, Avatar is way ahead of it's time.Now, let's come to the strong points of Avatar. It lies in its visual effects, editing & cinematography. Editing, like any Cameron movie, is brilliant. The cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment, the exotic creatures & incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora. Those who watched it in 3D knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora & fauna of Pandora. However, the backbone of Avatar is its visual effects. Groundbreaking from scene 1, it's not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which Visual Effects of Avatar reached new heights. World's 2 greatest visual effects studios, ILM & Weta Digital, worked together to produce this gem, and the results are wonderful. The attention in detailing & the magnitude scale of Pandora are sure to leave viewers jaw-dropped. Just the detailing on the face of a Na'vi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its making.Technically, Avatar is a breakthrough in film-making technology, 3D viewing & stereoscopic film-making with camera being designed specifically for the movie. If one looks at the story, it isn't that bad too. Of course not the best or even among the best, but still, it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world & that's what this movie is doing right now. At least, James Cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie, unlike Michael Bay(Transformers 1 n 2) or Roland Emmerich(2012, Godzilla etc) who rely only on VFX & nothing else. At least, Avatar scores pretty well above them. It tells a fine story & let VFX n SFX take this movie to new heights.James Horner collaborated with James Cameron for the 3rd time (after Titanic & Aliens) & no doubt, has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again. The score is not as epic as Titanic but is still excellent for a sci-fi film. The score is really beautiful & succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race. The beauty of the music of Avatar blends well with the beauty of Pandora. James Horner has done a fantastic job.Also, the story or screenplay of Avatar won't make it to the great lists. So, its better you go without expecting a quality plot & screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes. And make sure you watch Avatar in 3D for an all new experience. You won't regret it. Missing Avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema. So be a part of it.10/10 for Avatar's beauty & the wonderful experience I had in theater.",neutral
99,"""Avatar"" is an American movie from 2009 and still the most recent blockbuster movie by writer and director James Cameron. He dominated the awards season over a decade earlier with ""Titanic"" already and things looked similar back in 2010 when only ""The Hurt Locker"" managed to keep ""Avatar"" from winning all the very big prizes. Ironically enough, the former was made by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow which made for some interesting references (and bad jokes) at the Oscars back then. But still ""Avatar"" won three trophies at the Oscars alone and many many more during other big awards ceremonies. There are several versions out there of this film when it comes to the runtime and the longest is probably the director's cut that comes incredibly close to the massive 3-hour mark. Your choice if you want to go for this one or the original theatrical release for example. You can decide it perhaps if you plan on rewatching this extremely long and extremely blue movie before the sequels come out as it seems Cameron still wants to follow through with his plan of releasing no less than four sequels to ""Avatar"" until 2025 that he has worked on in the last decade.The cast includes Sam Worthington who is the lead actor here and it is definitely the by far biggest work of his career. Add to that Cameron's longtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver and relatively young actors like Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez or Zoe Saldana. The main antagonist is played by Stephen Lang who, as usual, elevates the material. Oh yeah, CCH Pounder is on board too and deserves the mention for sure. Basically, there are two kinds of people when it comes to ""Avatar"", those who really absolutely love the movie and think it is a revelation and then those who think it is all pretense and nothing special at all. So it sure is a clash of extremes and I personally would say they are both in the wrong. The right approach is somewhere in-between. ""Avatar"" is a movie that is breathtakingly beautiful on many occasions and that offers a solid story that is nothing too great though. But it also offers basically fight and war sequences for 45 minutes or so, basically the entire last third of the movie. And this is where the film somehow lost me to be honest. It is just too long for basically nothing but action scenes, even if lots of important stuff (deaths mostly) happens during that time.As for the film's frequently discussed environmental message, I am a bit undecided. I think the general concept of showing how humans (or Na'vi) should live in peace with nature and all its creatures, plants and animals, is a honorable one, but it is also pretty simple because you could wonder the extent to which the taming, i.e. the violent submission, works against this principle for example. But you could write pages on this subject to be honest, alone about this movie, and at times I must say I think it takes itself more seriously than it should given the substance it has and messages it is sending. I read frequently that people compare this film to ""Pocahontas"", but it's been so long that I have seen the latter (Have I at all?), so I cannot really elaborate on the subject. I think ""Avatar"" offers enough to enjoy the movie as its own creative achievement and even if it has sequences during which it drags a bit, it is still very much worth watching, preferably on the big screen. If you have a chance to do so (again), then don't miss out.To everybody who hasn't seen ""Avatar"" yet (if there are actually people out there that fit this description), maybe wait until the new films come out and then I am sure many cinemas will show this original film before and you can watch it there and then decide if you are interested in more. This is (as almost always with Cameron) by no means an actors' movie, even if some have baity material. It is really all about the messages and the world and the environment in this movie. All about the visual side basically. A whole new world. Maybe not a whole new movie as there are considerable weaknesses in here without a doubt. One of the better, but not very best films of 2009 I would say, one that deserves neither all the hate nor all the praise it's been getting. And for closure, let me say that the song during the closing credits is also pretty amazing to listen to.",neutral
100,"It was hard to believe that two hours and forty minutes had passed by the time this movie ended. This movie takes off right from the get-go, grabs a hold of you and drags you on a spectacular ride that leaves you breathless by the end. You've probably seen a few people say ""it's Dances With Wolves on an alien planet,"" or ""the storyline is too archetypal/predictable,"" but those don't scratch the surface. There's so much going on in this movie, and even the shortest of scenes can carry so much weight if you're paying honest attention to it.One of my biggest concerns going into this movie was that there would be 45 minutes or more of buildup before you really reached paydirt. There wasn't, and I don't know what it was about the trailers that made me think otherwise. You barely get 10-15 minutes of introduction to the characters before Jake is logged into his Avatar and testing it out. Like you could see in the trailer, he's simply thrilled to have working legs under him again, and Cameron did an absolutely phenomenal job of capturing what might have been a minor fact were this anyone else's film. Just the look on Jake's avatar's face when he starts wiggling his toes is brilliant.Nothing about this movie is simple; even when a scene appears to have little importance, the way Cameron has brought them all together makes each only a piece of what turns into a beautiful puzzle. The death and burial of an old Na'vi woman whose name is never revealed lasts all of maybe 8-10 seconds, and yet Sam Worthington's voice-over during the part makes it have such a huge impact. It's like the first time you see the creature in Alien: it's only 6 frames but it sticks with you throughout the movie and beyond. And that's the point here: people are going to talk about the visuals and your first instinct will be to think they mean the CGI, but that's not the case. The visuals are stunning in every way imaginable; each small scene is important, every facet of Na'vi life that is shown carries some weight - particularly to Jake - and the amount of work put into their tails, ears, eyes, and the motion-capture used for their facial expressions was worth every penny.The CGI is beyond phenomenal, and what Cameron has done here is kill any excuse by future movie-makers for having shoddy CGI. It's seamless, and it's hard to tell where live action ends and CGI begins much of the time - in fact, you won't even realize you're going from one to the other even when you go from the Na'vi to the humans and back. Even in those scenes where you have both humans and Na'vi on the screen together or even touching, it's clean and beautiful and only multiplies the effect. I was fortunate to see this movie at the IMAX-3D theatre, and it was worth the extra money: all that talk about birds and insects and whatnot flying through scenes wasn't just talk - it's incredible to behold.This movie may require the more faint of heart to bring a box of tissues with them. This is not the type of movie where someone dies and the main and supporting characters just go all crazy with rage and become ten times more fierce. Again Cameron has captured the grief surrounding the deaths of friends and loved ones with a deep intensity that is, at times, crushing (some of the scenes still bring tears to my eyes twelve hours later, and I don't cry at movies). Referring back to the scene I mentioned earlier with the burial of the Na'vi woman - it's very intense, powerful stuff, especially considering that the scene is seconds long and she's never named; if you're not getting an emotional jolt out of this movie then you're truly missing out on half of its power.On the way out of the theatre there were a few people complaining that it was predictable, even though they really liked it; the ultimate point is that Cameron has told a beautiful story, and despite the times when you go ""Oh, I know what he's going to do now,"" it's very easy to become attached to the characters, and care what happens to them. When people die, it hurts; Cameron has established all of the major characters to a point where you don't look at them and think ""This guy's cannon fodder."" All of them are integral to the story, and even during the epic battle toward the end of the movie, it's hard not to be moved by the casualties of even nameless Na'vi.Cameron is very proud of this movie and he should be; considering his history of Aliens, Terminator, Terminator2, and Titanic, it's hard to just look at something like this and say it's his best - but I truly feel this is. As much as I loved Aliens (formerly my favorite movie of all time), it did not move me the way Avatar did. I doubt any other movie ever will. DO NOT wait to see this on DVD or Blue-Ray; get to the theatre and watch this jewel of cinematography. If you can, see it on the IMAX-3D screen. You won't regret it, and I guarantee that.To parents wondering how children might handle this, the PG-13 rating is mostly due to language and the violence of the epic battle. There's no sex in the movie, though it is mentioned and there is a sort of fade-to-black that's confirmed later on. Last but not least, you do see Na'vi breasts from time to time but it's done tastefully, rarely, and in such a way that it's not throwing it in your face - if you're not looking at the right part of the screen you likely won't even notice.",positive
101,"Lord I miss the Last Air bender....James Cameron's half a BILLION dollar film (figure in the promotion its around that figure) is a huge animated film masquerading as a live action feature film. Its, like most of Cameron's super productions, a self serving over hyped monstrosity that is neither as good as he thinks it is or as bad as we hoped it would be.Billed as the next step in entertainment I'm left wondering what makes the film different then anything thats gone before other than the motion capture characters. The Next step? only if you go to the movie on rare occasions and never read fantasy or Science Fiction. Ursula Le Guin, Piers Anthony, EE Doc Smith and everyone else working in genre has been there before. Is it really worth the effort to count down the long list of films this borrows from Quigley Down Under to A Man Called Horse to the Matrix to Aliens to Dances with Wolves to anything I've read people have compared it to. Its a plot as well worn as they come. Even the music is lifted from tribal chants to Star Trek The Motion Picture to anything with soaring choral music. Its's also clear Wayne Barlowe designed the look of the creatures since they seem similar to numerous creatures he's painted over the years.(Had they wanted to be radical they would have had Barlowe go off the board) Okay I could go on ripping the film to shreds but lets try and take it on its own terms.Lets say it, the film is neither original nor ground breaking. Its an over hyped film that is much too in love itself. It is painfully overlong at seventeen...er almost three hours.The plot has a cripple ex-marine taking his twin brothers place as an avatar pilot on a distant world. He is assigned to infiltrate the locals and find out as much as he can. he does so and in the process falls in love with the people and one girl in particular. He then has to fight with his new people to save them and their way of life.On the most basic of levels the plot is fine but on a detailed level there are lots of plot holes and plot questions. Thankfully Cameron in his wonderful junior high school way has set up outs for many things that don't make sense like how will the good guys win when they have bows and arrows and the humans have explosives and bullets.( Cameron is not a stupid man as anyone who has heard him talk or seen his documentaries can attest, however his story construction has always been stunted and simplistic at best) How the simplicity will survive in two planned sequels is beyond me.There are lots of long ""look isn't this great"" sequences which are meant to show off. On the plus side they look good in 2D on the down side the film slows way down as a result.The performances are fine but out side of the main two characters everyone is cardboard. Its fine because they aren't given much to really do but at the same time they all blur together.The action scenes are good but not great with many of the oh cool sequences in the TV commercials. Also some sequences seem stretched out for no good reason with lots of slow motion to make everything look ""Cool"".In all honesty had this film lost an hour it would have been a much better film, but at two hours forty something minutes this film is a soul killer. My Dad and I just looked at each other at about the half way point an wondered how much longer this had to go and we both groaned when we realized it was almost it was eighty something minutes.Its not a bad film. Its worth seeing, but I don't know that I needed to see it on a big screen, and while I didn't see it in 3D I don't think I really would have liked it more if I had. Personally I think you can wait for DVD or cable.(A friend of a a friend who didn't like the film said that he now understands how people who don't get Star Wars feel. Frankly there is a difference. Love of Star Wars comes from a real place, a place that wasn't mass media created. All of the hype to Avatar is PR created hype put together to sell tickets. Star Wars is a film that is about characters moving in a simplistic story where things just are, the worlds of Luke Skywalker were not pushed in our faces until the marketing machines took over with Return of the Jedi and by that time the characters and the story had taken hold because they were good. Avatar is a simple story pumped up to sell tickets and sell toys.Its had the marketing machine from the first moment.. Star Wars has been out for almost 33 years, spawned 6 films, numerous novels, comics and TV shows. Avatar has been out a week and has spawned little more than some mixed box office and a budget debt bigger than many countries GNP. I'll wait 33 Years before I assess how successful Avatar is.) 6 out of 10",neutral
102,"I just saw it and I had unbelievable expectations for it(the kind that expected the next Star Wars out of it). And I was not disappointed in the least. I had read many comments about it being Dance's with Wolves in Space. I knew all the so called critical badmouth of the story. I have to tell you that I not only loved the characters, I loved the story as well. Something that many people forget is that there is a difference between plot and story. Plot is the generalized events that happen within a story. ""A person learns the ways of a race he originally looked down upon or did not understand. He ends up joining them in a battle against the people who he originally identified himself with."" That is a plot very cut and dry. There are many films with similar plots, in fact more than you would think. Does this plot line sound familiar to you? Guess why? Because you saw it in a little film I like to call 'District 9'. The man in District 9 looks down upon a race he does not understand, but as he becomes one of them(parallels Jake Sully in Avatar) he begins to identify with them and in the end fights with his own people. This film hailed by every living man and woman as original is almost identical with Avatar in plot. What you misunderstand is that what makes a film original is not it's plot but the story that carries the plot. District 9 is original because you have never seen Science fiction come to life as if it could happen. The story(the plots delivery if you will) makes all the difference. So now that we know the difference between plot and story lets look at why Avatar is original. While the story may draw parallels to Dances and Pocahontas it is by no means a copy. Never have you seen a paraplegic marine get his legs back by living through a organically grown alien. Never have you visited Pandora and explored such a vast and 'original' world. Or felt the thrill of flying on a dragon beside an ever increasingly attractive alien princess. The originality in this story is incredible for one reason alone, that the story takes the audience member on a journey with the character Jake Sully. We truly get to discover this amazing new world with him and share his excitement. Many people have said that this film has no character development, I beg to differ, I believe it adds a new depth to character development in cinema. How do we get to know people in real life? By sharing our time with them and laughing along with each other. Instead of this film telling you what to think of each character through their words, it allows us to share the events with the characters. As Jake learns to fly, we get the feeling of learning to fly along with him. The love story comes naturally because as we experience these things with Sully we too grow attached to Neytiri. As it has been said, this film is an experience. It is a journey we have never taken before and will wish to take again. That is why audiences adore this film, because it is original and we just aren't used to originality.",positive
103,"James Cameron's long-awaited Avatar turns out to be a flimsy excuse for some spectacular, yet empty posturing in never-before-seen 3D. The technological innovations will keep you interested for about an half hour, then the apparent flaws start to take over the viewing experience.Dialogue is, as might be expected, sub-par. Lead performances by Worthington and Saldana are flat and uninvolving. Script is laden with all the clichés Cameron could muster, and filled to the brim with unnecessary hand-holding of the viewer. Every conceivable aspect is over-thoroughly explained through dialogue, making for a totally unbelievable interaction between characters and world, and also giving the impression Cameron thinks I'm an idiot. So-called green and anti- colonial values are glued-on-top, and are completely unconvincing. Film is thin in every aspect except the 3D-visuals. As it turns out, the ""Indians"" are once again saved by White Male. Even the indigenous Na'vi are modeled after conservative human stereotypes. Female lead is in the end only there to be the romantic interest, the gender-models of the Na'vi mirror those old ""truth's"": women are emotional an effeminate, men are strong and masculine. Here Cameron affirms conservative stereotypes by giving them an intergalactic justification ""in natural order of things"".The film has been receiving raving reviews from mainstream critics, and is sure to be an international hit. This doesn't bode well for the future of Hollywood cinema. Up next: Transformers 3D!",neutral
104,"The only thing this movie did for me was make me soooo bored I actually started remembering the plot of FernGully. Which I hadn't seen in like 18 years. I couldn't even remember its name. When I arrived home I furiously searched the internet for this mystery movie that I had forgotten and that Avatar somehow reminded me of.Then I found it and realized that it's exactly the same plot, except that it's a movie for children - which incidentally AVATAR also is, it's just that it cost 500$ billion, or whatever, to make so they had to pretend like it was for adults, but it really isn't. It's a kid's movie, and a 2 hours too long one at that.Frankly, what surprised me most about it was that it gets such good reviews... from almost everyone. I'm going to sit and wonder why for a while.",neutral
105,"Yes Avatar is a movie which standouts by technical brilliance. It might don't have the best story, but all it provides is a visual treat.

There aren't many films which drags you to a whole new world and Avatar Does Exist!Waiting for the second Part....",positive
106,"Avatar in 2D: Incredible movie. Amazing visuals. Beautiful story. Great action sequences.I absolutely would go to see it again. While the early movie does suffer from the same syndrome that is seen in so many movies, namely a rushed fake-feeling time-lapse of events in some areas, the final hour is absolutely worth it. I will add the caveat that my feelings are affected by my being a fantasy buff. The druidic religion of the natives, the landscapes, and the general story all hold to the fantasy mold. Including the heart-wrenching fate that awaits the good guys. But that isn't a bad thing. It's once in a generation, if that, that someone writes a story that breaks out of that mold.Avatar was a work of art as much as a movie. The immersion of sight and sound had me often on the edge of my seat. The performance capture used to film the movie lets the Na'Vi come to life in a way no animation can. The incredible eye for detail that went into this movie is astounding, both technically, and in terms of creating the world.It is a great joy to me to see a fantasy movie done so well. It is extremely difficult to capture the essence of a true epic fantasy in the traditional length movie. At approximately 2 1/2 hours, Avatar doesn't cut it inordinately short but neither does it deter all but the hardcore fantasy fans with its length.Overall I absolutely give Avatar 2D a 5 out of 5.Avatar in 3D was a bit difficult to get used to at first: glare on the frame of the glasses, things seeming to be out of focus at times, the fact that the screen does not fill the entire field of view. However, after a break-in period and the realization that some of the focusing is because it's not meant to be in focus, things improved. It pulls your view to a certain aspect of the scene, the same way you have to focus on a particular thing with your eyes. It's just disorienting at first since what you focus on isn't necessarily what they want you to focus on.Also, I noticed that a lot of the movement scenes early on seemed to blur the image, as if it was not updating fast enough to form a smooth image. Through the second half I did not notice this much at all, but whether that is because it wasn't there or because I was concentrating harder on the events, I do not know. I suspect I was trying too hard to see the 3D while I eagerly waited for the movie to progress, having seen it once already.Hopefully in the future they will improve the delivery mechanism (ie, the glasses) and make the experience even better. I look forward to taking the final step and watching it on IMAX 3D! I give the 3D aspect a 3.5 out of 5. It definitely added to the experience, but was disorienting, difficult to get into, and has a few annoyances yet to work out.Avatar in IMAX 3D blew me away, even after seeing the movie twice previously. I can't say if it was the fact that I had seen the 3D once previously, the IMAX screen, the different frame for the glasses, or all the above, but that was an incredible experience! I think the key is to not try to see the 3D, but to just let yourself sink into the movie. Filling the field of view and having that depth of field makes it easy to really get into the action and forget yourself.There's not really a whole lot more I can say about that. 8000-10000 (depending on the theater) watts of surround sound tops off something you're not likely to forget, at least until the sequel! The IMAX 3D experience gets an easy 5 out of 5.",positive
107,"I've never done this before... Even if I am absolutely aware of my poor level of English, I simply had to register. Just to be able express my feelings and to leave my vote here.This movie is something I didn't expect. After all those ""blockbusters"" I have seen in the last time, no one could convince me about the fact, that this flick will be something different. Entering the cinema, I was really skeptic and awaited just another boring shooter with some expensive computer animations.Well.. But then it happened. After just few minutes, I was completely sucked into the world of Pandora, I was there, breathed the air, enjoyed the extraordinary nature. I fell in love with the Na'vi and with their lifestyle, their world.For those 166 minutes, I completely forgot everything else, my work, troubles, everything. This was the best experience, the best feeling I had from a movie ever! Actually the movie was too short for me, even after those almost 3 hours I still wanted more of it, can't describe my feelings.Leaving the cinema, I had tears in my eyes... couldn't stop them. I was just sad that I have to return back to Earth... Pandora was well... go and see it people and maybe you will feel the same I felt!",positive
108,"Rarely does Hollywood produce an epic, and rarely do they fall into capable hands. Not since The Lord of the Rings trilogy has there really been a satisfying epic that comes anywhere near the passion and ambition those films had, but Avatar comes damn close. It's not as strong as those films, but it does have strengths, as well as weaknesses.Are there flaws? Yes, but they're forgivable -- at least they were for me. The story and characters are very simple, and the former of the latter delves into familiar territory. However, despite this simplicity, the audience is given enough time to care for each character, especially when all hell breaks loose.James Horner’s the best he’s been in years. He does borrow from his past work, but honestly, if you haven’t listened to Horner’s previous scores, then you’re not missing out on much. There’s plenty of variety and complexity that makes this score soar when the action starts, and give beautiful growth for when we’re venturing around Pandora and having moments between the characters.The visual effects are certainly where Avatar succeeds on every level. The designs and execution are extraordinary. I first saw this in 2D (because, honestly, the film should be able to hold up in any format to be considered a film and not solely an experience), and even on the traditional screen, the visuals do nothing but make jaws drop. Cameron’s imagination is in perfect form here, and here’s hoping he does sequels.To me, the film never felt heavy-handed or hammy. Yes, some of the dialogue leans towards cheese, but it never becomes self-parody, maybe just a nod to the films of Cameron’s past. Despite the multiple parallels to the Iraq War, Blackwater, and Halliburton, this film was written over a decade ago, but these connections give Avatar a resonating power beyond the spectacle it already is.Even though Cameron the writer can undermine Cameron the director, he never loses us along this journey. There’s an immense buildup to the final third of the film, and Cameron’s attention to detail and storytelling more than allow the audience to gasp in awe at everything he pushes to the limit.The performances are well done. Stephen Lang stands out as the best of them all, he really does a great job at making Colonel Quartich one hell of a villain. Sam Worthington stole the show in Terminator: Salvation and he works that similar magic here. Zoe Saldana is also very intense and engaging in her role, especially when conflicts arise. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were believable through and through; no one gave less than 100%.All in all, everything worked in Avatar for me. I love the look, and whenever the audience was supposed to cheer, I cheered. At work, those who’ve seen the film loved it, so I’m hoping this word-of-mouth continues at the box office so we get more sequels of this caliber (maybe even higher). Not since The Lord of the Rings has there truly been a worthwhile epic in any genre, and Avatar could shape up to be a juggernaut should there be a bright future for it.",positive
109,"Avatar reportedly cost a staggering 230 to 310 million dollars if you are prepared to believe what Wikipedia claims. Me, I can't help thinking I'd rather have had either Terminator 5 or Aliens 7 or, given the budget, both.Go and see Avatar for the visual spectacle – and believe me when I say that describing the visuals as spectacular is an understatement. Pandora is beautifully conceived and rendered, though obviously by people who have never been in a forest in their lives given the lack of dead trees, dead leaves, mud and general detritus. The plants, animals and people are convincing and beautiful.The critics have been going on about this being a breakthrough in film-making technology but I can't see it. It looks good but doesn't look better than, say, Lord of the Rings. The wholly animated alien people, plants and animals are no more impressive than the CGI Gollum was a few years ago. I actually felt rather disappointed, I was expecting something new but this is more of the same computer jiggery-pokery.Do not go and see it for the plot and writing. The plot is a monumentally formulaic ""don't hurt the environment, man"" riff. We have seen all the characters before in a hundred other films: the driven research scientist who's brilliance allows her to be rude to everyone; the greedy corporate schill prepared to do anything to ensure a profit; the battle hardened colonel with an itchy trigger finger; etcetera ad infinitum. The dialogue, while not awful, is dull and unmemorable, lacking any humour or wit.Go and see it, the critics like it, most people like it, you'll probably like it. I thought it was okay with a side order of gigantically missed opportunity.Spoiler Giant corporation, ""The Company"" (Weyland-Yutani perhaps), plans to strip-mine the Eden-like planet/moon Pandora*. All that stands in their way are a race of technologically primitive aboriginals, the Na'vi (who suffer from what literary grammatologists call the ""Fantasy apostrophe"").Jake Sully, a paraplegic former marine, is recruited by The Company to operate the titular alien clone ""avatar"" originally made for his deceased twin brother. Sigourney Weaver's driven botanist/anthropologist wants him to help her study the aliens and their environment. Colonel Doombringer wants him to deliver intelligence on the aliens so that he can destroy them and Mr Corporate McEvil (Giovani Ribisi) wants him to persuade the Na'vi to leave their giant tree house so that he can drill for the precious unobtainum beneath it**.Jake, however, quickly becomes enamoured by the culture and ways of the Na'vi and his teacher, a stunningly gorgeous Na'vi called Neytiri (voice and, I assume, movements of Zoe Saldana). Coming to value the environmental harmony in which the Na'vi live, Jake leads them in a final battle to try to reclaim their world from the humans***.End Spoiler Expect a director's cut a few years after the DVD comes out where the voice-over has been removed and a bunch of unnecessary scenes added back in.* Who names a planet Pandora, for God's sake? Seriously? Anyone who knows their mythology knows that Pandora's Box contained all the world's evil. It's like saying ""I know, we'll call it Deathworld, that sounds nice right?"".** A quick google search indicates that ""Unobtainium"" is the material that Oakley use to make the frames for their shades (check it out if you don't believe me). This suggest the fascinating concept that, in the future, Oakley sunglasses have become humanity's primary means of exchange.*** !BIG SPOILER! Which they unsurprisingly win – I couldn't help thinking that before the credits there would be a screen of text saying ""Three years after these events, humans returned to Pandora, cleansing its surface with nuclear fire"".",neutral
110,"Avatar is a quintessential example of style over substance. There's nothing wrong with style and imagination, especially when Cameron does such a fine job of it. Avatar is a feast for the senses, overwhelming the viewer with a fully immersive, completely imagined world. It is a truly impressive achievement and sets the benchmark for all future movie worlds. (BTW, we didn't see the problems some other reviewers described in 3D theaters; our image was MOST impressive.)But...someone really needs to teach Cameron how to write dialog! Terminator and Aliens were better than his later efforts, most likely due to co-writers Gail Ann Hurd and David Giler. Unfortunately, Avatar suffers from simplistic plot devices and truly juvenile dialog that really left us cold. (JuJuBees? Unobtanium? - GMAB!) And while we know this movie is fiction, the visuals were good enough that they demanded a consistent ecosystem and evolution, at least for us. The 'floating mountains' and the English-speaking natives didn't bother us all that much; at least there was an attempt at explanation (large 'Unobtainium' deposits, the scientists' native school). But we really had a hard time with some of the biology. For example, why did the Na'vi, Banshee and Leonopteryx evolve with two arms (wings) and two legs while the Direhorse, Viperwolf, Hammerhead and many other creatures have four forelegs and two rears? That makes absolutely NO evolutionary sense and bothered us almost as much as the weak plot. With a little more work (and a little less hubris) Avatar could have been so much more. Unfortunately, it is truly stunning wrapping paper surrounding a rather disappointing gift.",neutral
111,"In 1984, he gave us a groundbreaking futuristic thriller in The Terminator. Thirteen years later he gave us the high grossing romantic period piece Titanic. Prior to that, he had the vision for the sheer beauty and amazement of his newest masterpiece, Avatar.I'm sure everyone knew to expect great visuals throughout the movie, but not nearly as much as this. James Camerons new world of Pandora showcases a vast amount of how creatively the mind of this genius works, and why technology couldn't represent it properly until now. Every single detail is carved in such a way that you are left with an abundance of awe from just a quick glance upon the vividly lush screen. Though most films with an abundance of CGI and effects often overlook the acting in the film, Avatar even refuses to make that cliché. Sigourney Weaver is as great as she always is, and simply adds to her accomplishments. Sam Worthington has the perfectly roguish mentality that makes him the perfect choice for the primary role, and Zoe Saldana has made a career for herself this year alone, with her success in Star Trek over the summer and exemplifies her gifted talents with a powerful role here. Th most surprising role in my eyes, however, was that of Michelle Rodriguez as the pilot. For the first time, not only is she given a role that suits her, but she manages to showcase just how good an actress she can be with the right role. While this movie does have its haters, and will obviously continue to do so, one of the most repeated criticisms of Avatar is that it is simply a superfluous futuristic version of Dances with Wolves. I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but do consider this a better film. While the two do have several similarities, the raw emotion infused with grade A technology simply magnify the drama of the plot to an infinite degree. While it is clearly a depiction of the story of American Indians, their life, infiltration, and ultimate loss of home and identity, the obscure version of this tale makes it more impactful on ones mind. The wordplay involved within the film deserves its own applause. From the mineral being called ""unobtanium"", to the name of the planet being ""Pandora"", the foreshadowing of these words just continues to add to the depth of the movie. Despite the fact that I have seen several dramatic, historical, futuristic and action films, I simply cannot recall a better combination of each of these major genres, with humor and emotion in my lifetime. It has been a while, both since Cameron has released a new film an I have anticipated a movie for so long( 3+ years), and both waits were undoubtedly worth it. It also borrows from films such as Dances with Wolves and District 9. Ultimately, Cameron's lesson is perfectly taught, his vision is fully showcased, and this legendary film is undoubtedly a prime candidate for one of the best overall cinematic viewing experiences in modern film history, from visuals to storyline and its telling, along with fine acting and sheer brilliance. A great tale of epic proportions from a directorial mastermind that can match the levels of Scorcese and Welles. 10/10.",positive
112,"Avatar is to my generation of movies what 9/11 was to my generation of tragic events that shook the world (I'm 16), in that is an experience I will never forget. When I am much much older, I will still be able to look back on this very night and remember everything about it; where I was, who I was with, how old I was, and, most of all, how amazed I was at what was happening before me. This all may sound like a bit much to say about one movie, but believe me. This is an event, folks.Many people have compared Avatar to Star Wars, saying that it had the same effect on audiences today as the latter had on its audience back in '77. They're right (to a certain extent, obviously). What James Cameron has done with his latest project is taken a simple enough story, and poured his heart, vision and imagination, and a couple hundred million dollars into it. The result blew me away in a way I didn't think was possible with movies today. I really thought we had seen it all. Leave it to the one and only Cameron to prove me wrong on that.The level of detail in every plant, creature, and environment is a new landmark in the world of cinema. It really goes to show that anything is possible in the movie world, and it takes a movie like Avatar to remind us of that in this day in age when audiences are so used to getting huge overdoses of special effects in their movies, and show us why we love going to the theater so much. Because, like I said before, anything is possible in a film. If Avatar doesn't make you realize that, then I can guarantee you that nothing else will.Avatar is every bit the movie I was hoping it would be. It lived up to and surpassed all the hype and I can't wait to see it again. What makes this movie so special is that you can watch it again and again and still be amazed by it, unlike some films where the impact is never the same after the first viewing. Obviously the effect of Avatar on its audiences will be much different after their first viewing, but it will always be an incredible experience.10/10",positive
113,"Avatar is the kind of film that makes a cinema visit worthwhile, I saw it 13 years ago, and it lived with me ever since. It is of course known for its sensational visuals, but it is so much more than that.It's a great storyline, I love the concept of the planet, The Avatars, Jake's story, it's just captivating.It's moving, exciting, dramatic, it crosses over so many genres, it's the kind of film that takes you away from whatever you have going on.You still cannot help but be blown away by the visuals, you could say it's arthouse in the mainstream, but it's more than that, this film was a game changer, the visuals even now are spellbinding. The animals, forests, effects are all tremendous, they've aged pretty well also.Three tremendous performances, which have all always stood out for me, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and of course Sigourney Weaver.I knew we'd get a follow up, I just didn't think that we'd be waiting 13 years for it, I can't wait to see it.Glorious, 9/10.",positive
114,"This is such a perfect example of a film where the director/writer is absolute horrible, and the visual effects guys are insanely good. There is nothing beyond this movie than the special effects. The people that do not see this are either stupid, blinded by the effects or simply in denial. To rate this movie good got NOTHING to do with taste what so ever, but is simply wrong. WRONG. These movies were good in an early period(at the beginning), but its now become too many of them, and the originality in these sci-fi films is no longer existent. Yes, the message of the movie is good. But its old. Any clever kid understood the greediness of the human species beforehand. And if you needed a movie to enlighten that, than you're not more clever than a 10 year old. Sorry to say.It starts of with our main character, Jake. We get a quick intro about his prehistory and why he is sent to where he is sent, and thats about all of character development and description we get of this guy. I cant feel him at all. I never did. He is sent to a new world and there he must learn from the inside. Inside from a tribe that got their homeland on an area where there is some sort of rock that is highly valuable. Then this bad guy comes up. Oh My GOD. What a stereotype. This type of characters 10 years old can create. Same goes with the script.He falls in love with a girl(Oh gosh please) and the world. He fights against the ""evil"" and they win. The end. I knew this ending would happen 15 minutes into the film. What a flop. I cant understand it got nominated for best pictures and best director at the Oscars.",neutral
115,"First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.Storywise, there is no story at all. It's the typical good vs bad scenario shaped out of cowboys against indians in space mixing it with a yogi everything connects us to the world impression plus a goddamn planet called Pandora and looks like f...in' paradise. Lot's of shiny colours and huge monsters who eat flesh are your best friends. Come on. You gotta be kidding me.Maybe I might be the only one here, cause all reviews I've seen got great score, but that is not what a movie is supposed to be. I was very unimpressed by the CGI and the artistic development because I might be used to computer games such as Final Fantasy series which has been the shaper of such incredible stories, only that these games have a very strong story to tell and and you feel totally involved.It impresses me that people give this such a high rating because of it's visuals. I mean it was clear that sooner or later a movie would appear with such incredible CGI. If it wouldn't have been Avatar another would have been the winner.I am sad that nowadays cinema is ail centered only about violence, good looks and a huge lack of brain.3 out of ten only for the cgi which I thought is not the center of a movie otherwise I would have rated it beneath 0.",negative
116,"How can people always find something to complain about even for the best of the best, always amuses me. What's wrong with the Storyline? Ya, it is something that we have seen before.. No.. I am not referring to the past movies with similar story lines.. I am talking about those Natives in America, Aborigines in Australia, the natives of Africa, the countries oppressed by Colonial England, the oppression of communist China.. The greed of corporates and governments that killed millions of people because they were the dominant ones at that point in History! Yes, where we have seen this story before is in our History as humans!Well, when someone is making the most expensive film of the century and pours all his passion and imagination into it, I am proud of James Cameron that he chose this Storyline and not some silly Military story that glorifies war or a meaningless rambling about the significance of an old and irrelevant book! He knew his movie was going to be watched with passion the world over... What better message can he convey to the world with his movie than saying, men and women of the future! you better see this movie.. Remember all the sins your forefathers committed in this world.. Be compassionate and don't ever do it again!I would say this to the haters who complain about the lack of originality or the lack of emotional strength. The movie does move you if you are prepared to be moved. The movie conveys a message if you want to listen to it! If you think there is no message or that you are not moved, then it is because you do not have the heart to understand. I am sure there are such people in this world. If everyone in this world was compassionate enough to understand this message, why were those sins against humanity committed in the first place!",positive
117,"Avatar, the movie that turns into a world !I Would like to share the joy I have watching this movie over and over (twice in 2D and once in 3D).Avatar is really hitting the brain, it makes you feeling so good, but unfortunately, so sad after quiting the theater, you just want to stick next to the Na'vi on Pandora.I think that everyone that has an heart will be affected by this movie, and will feel very sad on earth after this !Enjoy the one of the best movie ever !!!The actors are playing very well, the music is epic, the tears will just flow on your face during the movie !ney-tiri@live.com",positive
118,"To me no man can be gifted more and gifted better than the ability to imagine, create, structure, and produce thoughts against convention or any degree of sanity; the best that a man can ever do is think, and make an audience experience his thoughts and his world in a way he deems best. The only work of James Cameron that I loved till this evening was the Judgement Day. It was slick, it was futuristic and it was everything we wanted in the early nineties; Titanic was stupid, Titanic was glossy and borrowed in ideas, and Titanic was everything commercial cinema wanted in the late nineties. Today, I watched the best movie I've ever enjoyed in my twenty years of life, the only movie that got me to the edge of the seat, clapping and smiling widely for 2.5 long hours, the only movie I thought I felt goosebumps until 20 minutes outside the hall, and the only movie that was special enough to make me hold my pee in and consider taking a leak in my pants, fearing I might miss a second of this cinematic brilliance.They say the only reason Avatar's working is because it's got the most brilliant effects but can't afford an enthralling plot line, I say thats bullshit. The only movie I think came extremely close to Avatar was The return of the king, and the plot line there wasn't as much of an original script as a screen adaptation of one of the most popular literary works in history. Avatar is original, avatar doesn't feel futuristic, it's like a totally new world that is so believable not because of of the effects but for the totally incredible concepts that Cameron produced and delivered patiently and with the prowess he's acquired over the years. There have been movies, documentaries, commercials, infomercials on the way the humans are filthiest race ever, but never has a movie pulled it off as this. The best part about it is that the creatures (strangely they never make a very strong mention of what they're called), are so emotive, so real and so much more human than the human characters in the movie, that your heart goes out to them and you feel the stab in your chest when things go wrong. Avatar is unachievable and irreplaceable in cinematic history. It's epic, but not a revolution since it's so brilliant that it's almost improbable for a movie to follow-up to what Cameron's achieved. It does have plot lines dissolving in the most predictable climaxes, and I'm glad it's done that way and originality for the sake of originality is not attempted. The movie reestablishes our belief in love, life, hope, power, energy, and magic, and in the strongest way makes us question- What really went wrong with us?I have no idea how the guy produced and held such insane creativity inside his head for 3 long years while creating this epic, and still managed to keep it sane,",positive
119,"Avatar, set in the far future, is the story of wounded ex-marine Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington). Sully is handicapped and cannot walk anymore, but is offered a deal that would change his life forever. Space travel is common and a mining mission is employed on an alien planet known as Pandora. The planet is populated by a race of indigenous and environmentalist extraterrestrials known as the Na'vi. Their main village rests upon the richest deposit of the substance that the humans are trying to mine, but the population simply refuses to re-locate. Colonel Quaritch (played by Stephen Lang) introduces Sully to an operation in which he will control an external body called an Avatar, which is his DNA mixed with the DNA of a Na'vi. Sully's Avatar is transported to Pandora in an effort for him to befriend the Na'vi, gain their trust, and eventually find a desire that could get the aliens to relocate. While learning the Na'vi culture and language, he bonds and falls in love with Neytiri, the daughter of the Na'vi king and queen. Sully switches sides and eventually joins the aliens in a fight to save the stunning beauty of Pandora.One word may have popped into your mind after you read my plot summary: Pocahontas. Yes, Avatar does draw many parallels to the Pocahontas legend, and simultaneously embeds strong environmentalist messages into the story as well. The story was not the most original ever created, and it is not meant to be. The simplistic story adds to the epic tone of the film that slowly creeps its way in as the climax builds up to its finale. It is true that the plot is something we have all heard about, but never has it been presented in this manner. By the end of the film, the satisfaction one garners after the grand finale exceeds that of every Lord of the Rings film. This is classic storytelling, in James Cameron's simple yet powerful directing style. Although Avatar may seem like the average action flick of today, many of Cameron's old-time trademarks are clearly evident. There are plenty of rolling feet shots, notorious one-liners from villainous characters (like those found in Aliens, True Lies, and Terminator 2) and the action flows very nicely in true Cameron style. The writing was also very nostalgic. Cameron does not rely on complex, mind-wrenching dialogue to tell his story. The romance was well written, and character development is clearly evident as Jake Sully undergoes his transitional phase on Pandora. Some people criticize this Avatar's dialogue for coming out as a bit clichéd and ""corny."" I honestly would not have enjoyed the film if the dialogue tried to hard to be revolutionary. An epic adventure like this just needs powerful acting behind the lines to work, and in that area, Avatar delivers. Sam Worthington is great and this film is yet another great example of how the Australian actor is quickly becoming one of the best and prolific actors of this generation. Zoe Saldana brought the bold, strong, and fearless character of Neytiri to life. She served as a great love interest character and her Na'vi background helped enhance how valuable of a character she is. Sigourney Weaver's performance as Grace Augustine, a botanist who specializes on Pandoran plant life, is also great as one can expect from her. The villainous Colonel Quaritch was also a fantastic character thanks to Stephen Lang's absolutely powerful performances. Cameron implemented a wonderful and fearless villain into the film and every character (including the wildlife of Pandora) stood out on it's own.I cannot find words to describe the visual impact of this film. Breathtaking, phenomenal, and amazing are all understatements. The amount of painstaking effort put into realizing the world of Pandora really paid off. The entire alien planet, including the Na'vi characters, is computer-generated, yet many shots would make the viewer wonder where they shot the film on location. New and extensive performance capture techniques were created for this film. Cameron improved upon previous motion capture methods that were used for characters such as Gollum (The Lord of the Rings) and Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean) in order to make his computer-generated characters more life-like. The Na'vis convey real emotions down to the very small muscles on their faces. The attention to detail was so carefully handled that you do not worry about things being over-the-top. You simply believe that the setting is there and the characters are undergoing a huge conflict within it. The design involved in the film was astounding and a lot of caring dedication was put into the character designs. A full phonetic language was designed from the ground up for the Na'vi civilization, in addition to a full background lore and mythology for the population. The animals look like ordinary animals at first glance, but when you see them up close with repeated viewings, you realize how alien they are. The predatory creatures that dwell in the forests of Pandora look absolutely menacing, and the dragon-like Ikrans serve a great purpose in the entire movie. James Cameron, along with other top-notch artists like Neville Page (of Cloverfield and Star Trek fame) and others from WETA Digital created a new world full of wildlife, plants, geographical locations, and a humanoid population. Pandora is simply a living and breathing world that is truly a sight to see in which the 3D effect greatly enhances.Avatar is a film experience that will be remembered for years to come. James Cameron has succeeded once again in creating a wonderfully entertaining film with the perfect balance between love, action, and mild comedy. In addition to this, the director has taken another step in upgrading the way we watch films in the future.",positive
120,"There's enough reviews, my only complaint is a major technical one that you would think Cameron would have noticed given that he went over every frame of the movie a thousand times. Why are the Avatars approximately 9 feet tall for the entire movie (you get a good idea of their scale in the first scene when he wakes up in his new Avatar and breaks out of the lab. The Avatars are 3-4 feet taller than an average human) THEN - in one of the final scenes SPOILERRRR!!! When the Avatars are lined up in a row and overseeing the humans marching onto their ship to go back to earth after the Avatars win the war, the Avatars are MORE THAN DOUBLE AND LOOKS LIKE TRIPLE THE SIZE OF A HUMAN!! There's one shot and Giovanni Ribisi's character looks like he's looking at a cloud. I think the artists got the perspective wrong or something. Humans barely come up to the knees of the Avatars in this one scene but in the hand to hand combat scene between Worthington's character and the Colonel guy they're reasonably close in size. This is my only review of the movie other than the story is far more simple than I expected. I judge a movie by whether or not I would see it again and I doubt I would see this again.",neutral
121,"I just came home 5 minutes ago from seeing an early morning showing in 3D. My expectations were pretty high in seeing this movie as lets face it, it's James Cameron. James has consistently made great films through his career and he's tried to better himself every time, but still maintaining to entertain the audience. This time round he have excelled in every aspect of film-making.Right, down to the film. All the backlash from the first teasers were forgot within the first 30 minutes of viewing, and I'll never listen to critics in the future ever again. How wrong they were. Sure there were elements of other films like Dances with Wolves, but I saw greater connections with the Final Fantasy VII game. I'm not even prepared to say that the comparisons are a bad thing, as this film (in my opinion) is greater than anything it will be compared to. A bold statement I know.Now Pandora is a world needed to be seen in 3D, I'm sure the 2D version will be a great movie, but you won't feel like you are actually there. The realism in the visuals is far greater than anything I have ever seen, the CG characters make Gollum look like Roger Rabbit. The world appears real like our own and you connect and feel for the place and its inhabitants towards the end. I really wanted it to be as real as it seemed.If you are familiar with the plot, you will be please to know that any political statement made, its not one forced upon us throughout, its subtle, but the message is clear. As the audience, you are allowed to forget about our own world troubles and be part of an amazing adventure that will stay in your mind for a long time. Bravo James Cameron.",positive
122,"Well, I have to say I'm not exactly an enthusiast of this movie. James Cameron does it again and is able to create a huge blockbuster that everyone seems to like, that seems to be carved to do big in the Oscars but again I'm left with a bittersweet taste that this will not have, like Titanic, a very long life in the top of the best movies. For me the movie seems to try to disguise the simple plot with a wide variety of computer graphics (not as amazing as I thought) and making it long, really long, so that it can leave us numb. Then they put all those 3d stuff flashing that is just pure evil to leave you amazed. But if you look behind the cosmetics you'll see a simple and uninteresting movie. The movie reminds a bit Miyazaki but without the passion, without the creativity, and embedded in action and corny scenes. Well maybe I'm broken. Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?",neutral

There's no guessing game and not too much of the plotting, it was objective and smart with its clichés ,it keeps you glued and pays you many times more to you than you paid with every second.A complete lovable heartfelt connection of man with an alien, an instinct to survive and the way of life , a journey from the underdog to the leader , a journey from pandora to earth!

124,"(Contains Spoilers!!!)For myself to describe this film I could end up writing a book as to how the amazing James Cameron came about making this jaw dropping movie but I will keep it briefFrom the outset as the movie starts by showing outer space, we know that he starts resembling to older sci-fi movies such as Blade Runner, Aliens, etc. But we see so much more when the world of Pandora is shown in front of us. The world is such an exotic place, it makes me wish that it actually existed because the 3D effects of this movie will never be matched by acclaimed movie makers such as Christopher Nolan, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg; this movie is in a league of its own, overall the effects will change the way we watch movies. I've read reviews that the plot is weak but when you are submerged into the world of Pandora you forget that, it's like you just wanna get up of your seat and jump into the world of Pandora, the detail has been done right down to little insects which look breath taking and so realistic, that's how good Mr. Cameron has made this movieOverall, the movie should make a cash loads of money but believe the movie will be in my view the best movie of 2009 and my best movie of all time, I think the amount of work that James Cameron has done is just amazing and it makes you think that why can't a world like a world of Pandora really exist?The acting is amazing - despite some cheesy scenes near the end but in my view I would love to see the beautiful Zoe Saldana get nominated for Best Supporting Actress, she was just amazing and brought so much to the roleVerdict: Amazingly jaw dropping effects which will make you wanna see the movie more than once just so you can see the wonders of Pandora(Going to go and see it again)",positive
125,"I was not blown away by this movie like everyone else seems to be. First, the good stuff. There are some good actors in here, especially the actor who plays Jake (though I might be biased, because he was pretty hot), and they all commit to what they're doing and make it believable. As everyone says, the graphics and visuals are pretty freakin' awesome (as well they should be, with the budget of this movie). The world that Cameron creates is stunning, mesmerizing, and pure: the special effects are amazing. Like many, I saw it in 3D and it was good old fashioned movie-going fun. Yay! Okay, now for the not so good parts. As others have stated, the storyline/plot is a little lacking. I had trouble understanding the motivations of many of the characters. Ah, yes, character development - that would have been nice, too. Don't expect any. Yes, it's a recycled and re-used plot: clichéd and often predictable. It seems reminiscent of many great classics, my favorite being ""Star Wars."" Now I'll be the first to admit that the mythical structure of ""Star Wars"" was not completely original, but at least it seemed Lucas ""made it his own"" (to quote American Idol?) with his original characters and unique setting. ""Avatar"" is practically plagiarism (one line in particular made me want to shout ""THE FORCE!"" in the middle of the movie). Also- we get practically no character background at all, so we have no idea what makes these people tick (perhaps there would have been more if the edited version wasn't already a staggering 2 hrs 40 min.). Instead, we get one-dimensional, stock characters that had me rolling my eyes underneath my uncomfortable and overpriced 3D glasses. Lastly, the film is doused with lessons in morality from Mr. Cameron; it is a blatant criticism of US foreign policy. Not everyone will pick up on this, which I understand, since most of us want mindless entertainment at the movies. But upon closer review, I don't see how some people cannot see it. One of the ""evil"" characters actually says: ""We'll fight terror with terror!"" (Though mind you, they are attacking a planet filled with peaceful inhabitants who have never attacked them, for the simple quest of obtaining a precious metal called...unobtainium...::rolls eyes again::) Now I don't mind a little political satire here and there, but it seems misplaced in what is seemingly intended as a mindlessly entertaining popcorn flick.To give an example of the poor story-telling and lack of motivation: the ""evil"" humans are attacking the peaceful planet of Pandora in hopes of getting more ""unobtainium"" (gah it's so cheesy) but Cameron never bothers to tell us WHY. It is barely even mentioned. Is it just pretty and shiny like gold? Or, as another reviewer brilliantly pointed out, this stuff could save lives on Earth for all we know. It is never explained and the movie makers just assume you will accept it and not care what the reason is. I was actually really glad to come to IMDb and find there were others who felt the same way. I don't think it was an awful movie, I just don't think it's worthy of the enormous praise that seems to surround it. Should you see it? Yeah, sure, it's pretty entertaining I guess. And if you are into graphics/special effects, and/or don't mind gaping plot holes, then you'll probably love it.Bottom line: Remember when Lucas revamped the ""Star Wars"" saga with the three new prequels, and instead of telling a great story with interesting characters like he did with the original trilogy, he got so obsessed with graphics and special effects that it pretty much ruined the whole movie? Yeah, it's kind of like that. I guess they stole that from ""Star Wars,"" too.",neutral
126,"When I first heard about this film I was looking forward to it a lot but I must admit when I saw the trailer it didn't really do it for me. It wasn't what I thought it would look like. But as I like every other James Cameron film I thought I would check it out and I must say it is spectacular. I didn't think I would like but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.The visual effects are just amazing. There is no other word to describe it. Pandora actually felt like it was real. It was that good. The attention to detail was brilliant. It just looked so realistic, visually stunning. The scene where Jake learns how to fly looked amazing. The dragon like creatures looked very real and were very well designed. I loved it when Jake and Neytiri were racing down the side of the mountain. The camera angle they got on that was brilliant.The last 30 minutes of the film was just breathtaking. I mean it was all systems go. It was non stop action the whole way. James done a great job of putting that together. It was just so well done. They had some great moments when it went slow motion. That was brilliant. It was just so mad with all helicopters and the navi in the air taking each other out.Colonel Miles who was played by Stephen Lang was the best character for me. He played him so well that he really made you hate him because he was just so brutal. He just didn't really care about anyone. He just pretty much wanted everyone dead. The look of his character was spot on, making him big and mean and having those scars across his face.Also the navi looked really good. I mean loads of people were saying they looked rubbish in the trailer but on the big screen they looked amazing. It was just amazing how they got the facial expression looking so good. I mean when Jake jumped in the lake when he was being chased it looked so real when the water was dripping from his face.James Cameron can definitely be happy with this film. He just never disappoints. Some of his camera angles were brilliant. They were just so clever. I mean the end battle must have taken him ages to film, let alone edit. This film is definitely one was best films I have ever seen and gets me really excited to see what the film industry could be like in a few years to come with technology like this. It is so entertaining and will have you glued to the screen throughout the whole film and wanting to see what Cameron can come up with next. I can't wait to see what the sequel will be like.",positive

I've read some comments stating that avatar does not belong in the top 250 movies on IMDb, as its numbered 26th i think,well not only should it belong there i personally think it deserves to take first or second place on IMDb's list for the pure genuine pleasure, and Cameron is ahead of time, he proved it in 1991 with T2 JUDJMENT DAY and he proved it again with AVATAR.",positive
128,"I was expecting a lot and I did get a lot in the movie. So much so that Vatican felt threatened and made a statement on nature worship and NeoPaganism as they have monopoly on any GOD about some themes in the movie. Graphics is best in class and actually I had motion sickness, personally I may not see more 3D movies because I cannot take it. Let your self roll with the movie and wander where the movie want to take you. Race is shown little bit but usually very abstract themes don't drive home a major point without some simple analogy and analogies are logically related in the sense not in totality, hence futility of people finding race question here. There are some scenes of hanging rocks and holographic screens which I think are for entertainment purpose vs enlightenment of young minds and are truly quite original though journey to the center of earth did introduce the concept. Na'vi's speaking English makes me wonder what point we are making there but let us not hang on that theme because you will loose the effort spent in getting Na' vian language up to speed. Na'vi people are not so realistic but just think that movie is a super hit without that because Madagascar has a better eye coordination with mode and dialogues. One more point, Avatar is an Indian word meaning reincarnated self of usually God or superhuman being and quite well chosen like Yoda (another Indian word meaning warrior from Star Wars). All in all buckle up and get ready for pretty fantastic future like Wall.E, it may be a matter of choice in future to have or not have and struggle.",positive
129,"Visuals: For years Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and all sorts of other sci-fi or fantasy movies have been trying to take us to another world. This one succeeded, and it was so beautiful. I swear that I had a religious experience in reaction to the visuals to this movie, probably akin to the feeling that many people had when they watched the original Star Wars for the first time in theaters. I don't tend to get teary eyed over physical beauty that often, but this world moved me to tears from the sheer beauty of it. It was like stepping inside an expressionistic painting. If you get a chance to see this in 3D, do it! If you get a chance to see it in the theater, do it! If you miss out on all that and watch your DVD in an old tube television, well... still watch it, although you might not have quite the same reaction as everyone else. The visuals get an A, and I somehow feel that an A isn't high enough to do this movie justice.Sound: If the sound had failed, then the visuals would have too. Pandora sounded alive and organic. The creatures made sounds that matched the visuals and the music superbly added to the drama of what was going on. A Acting: I tip my hat to every actor in this movie. The humans interacted with the CG characters in such an organic way that I really never questioned the fact that the humans were reacting to no one. Sam Worthington, mixing this with his roles in Terminator 4 and Clash of the Titans, may be establishing himself to be the next big action star since Jason Statham. Likewise, Zoe Saldana's career is on the rise as she just came off playing Uhura in the Star Trek reboot. And then there's Stephen Lang... good Lord, I do not want him angry with me under any circumstances ever. The man was ripped in this movie and looked like he could give Chuck Norris a run for his money. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a movie with Stephen Lang portraying a character very similar to his role as Col. Miles Quaritch, but as the movie's main protagonist instead of villain. The acting department gets an A! Story: Normally, I tackle story first thing in my reviews. I saved it for last here, because I really loved this movie, but that doesn't mean that I'm blind to some issues with the storyline.My initial review was too long for IMDb, to read my full review visit tacmovies.blogspot.comAnyhow, this is the archetypal mole goes native story. There are some shocking similarities between it and the novel Call Me Joe, and it wouldn't be the first time that Cameron had been sued for plagiarism, as Harlan Ellison sued him over Terminator, but I still think that simultaneous creation is possible in this instance. Regardless, the story is pretty good, but it's definitely the weakest link in the chain. All of the characters played their parts in making this story function, but I definitely thought some parts were written a bit shallow, for instance (SPOILER WARNING): 1. The Na'vi never once thought that Jake was giving intel to the humans? I think tvtropes.com might call this ""Plot Induced Stupidity,"" especially when you consider that they only let him stay there to gain intel on the humans. Slightly hypocritical, if you ask me. Since we're on the subject, Neytin turned on Jake and immediately never wanted to see him again before the humans attacked and her father died. This despite the fact that the Na'vi mate for life and the two just mated. After taming a red dragon-like creature, she welcomes him back with open arms.Okay, this functionally works to progress the story, but I think a better progression would have been to have the two mate, Jake reveals his mole status and the rest of the Na'vi turn on Jake but Neytin, feeling that strong, irrational mating bond, stands by her man until her father dies, at which point she turns on him. Jake then tames a red dragon and symbolically regains the trust of the Na'vi but it takes a little longer for Neytin to forgive him. At least, that's how I would have done it.2. The evil human corporation is willing to massacre innocent natives to make a quick buck. It's so one dimensional that it's painful. Not to say that it couldn't happen, but I wanted more, and I think the movie hinted at more. In fact, Worthington's character mentioned that the earth had been ruined somehow. If we as a race no longer had a home world and were dependent upon Unobtainium to survive, and the Na'vi were unwilling to negotiate giving us any Unobtainium for over six years (which the movie stated was the timetable the negotiations had gone), then I think stealing it wouldn't necessarily have been the right thing to do morally, but necessary for the survival of the human race. The story hints that this is what's going on behind the scenes, but never says it outright probably because we the audience would turn on Jake Sully if we knew that. In any case, I would have preferred that the storyline be less cut and dry. The soldiers just started shooting. They didn't try a covert mission to steal the Unobtainium first, and the money grubbing corporation didn't recognize the potential money to be made in harvesting the forest's telepathy/soul bank? Again, I thought the writing was okay, but with some major problems. C Overall: You should see this movie. It's awesome. Yes, the writing is a bit shallow at times, but it's still really good in spite of the writing. A",positive
130,"I have seen Avatar three times, tonight being my 3rd viewing. I saw it in 2D the first two times because I felt like the 3D would be horrible and unwatchable/blurry/etc.I was wrong, the 3D version literally places you in the amazing world of Pandora...I left the theater after seeing this movie and just looked in amazement at Earth, how simple and almost disgusting it looked compared to the beautiful Pandora. (yes the plants in Pandora glow at night)I can't even describe how good this movie is...yes I was one of the millions of people who thought it looked stupid because it was blue aliens running around screaming...I couldn't have been more wrong about my expectations for this movie, within the first 5 min my opinion on it changed.I believe it will be many years before I see a movie as incredible as this, just when you think Hollywood has run out of gas, James Cameron spends half a billion on the most epic movie ever created in Hollywood history. What else could he possibly have in store for us? Titanic, Terminator, Aliens...guy just doesn't stop cranking out the masterpiece films.",neutral
131,"James Cameron's Avatar is a breath of fresh air. Although the story itself is one that we have seen before in the likes of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai of a man who falls in love with a way of life and has to choose between what he knows and what he loves, Cameron's masterstroke is in setting the story on another world and so it is not restrained by certain parameters which leaves him free to tell an emotional story. The performances by the actors are fine and all invoke the emotions of there characters eg Giovanni Ribisi plays the Corporate bad guy perfectly. However it is James Cameron's ability to make you fall in love with a world that does not exist which makes this film work. People remark that it is a work of art which you will have to decide for yourself. In all this is a must see movie and I believe will collect a lot of Oscars.",neutral
132,"I am still in awe. This film has surpassed the visual barriers. It is the marking the beginning of a new era in film. Why do I say that? Because it's done by James Cameron and after-all, he has surpassed technological barriers before with the release of Terminator 2 and Titanic in the 90's.This movie has been in the making for over 15 years and it looks like it has paid off. James wanted to wait till technology got better, then he got his inspiration from Lord of the Rings. He took that inspiration and he perfected so that NO ONE will ever make a movie this good for a very long time, visually. He created the camera, the graphics, basically he created new technology and this opens SO MANY windows of opportunities for other film-makers in Hollywood. The next decade of sci-fi, or special effects driven films will look like Avatar thanks to James Camerons' technology.Now to the story. This is such a beautiful tale of a man with a disability who befriends a different species outside of our solar system and respects their way of life. Now a lot of people compare this movie with ""Dances With Wolves"" but I have never seen that movie so I can't say anything and it seems that people love comparing films nowadays to feel like they deserve to have an opinion. Anyway, on with the story. After our main hero befriends the Na'vi populace, he has a change of heart and sides with them, the militia that has populated Pandora doesn't like this, they just want their materials and will kill anything in their path to have it.The Na'vi are not a violent species unless they are pushed over the edge. The humans who inhabit the planet only want raw materials that sell for 20 million a kilo. A lot of other parasites have said that it makes fun of Americans and their way of life, of how they seek nothing else but to dominate everything in its path. I mean, isn't that true? They love doing that, and they have been doing that for the last 200 years. But this movie is not about that egotistical, and arrogant country, it's about the human species when it comes into contact with another species; we hunt them down if they don't co-operate or if they we think they're a nuisance, and on top of that, claim their land as ours. It's true though, we would do that if we wanted to colonize on another planet with another species. We would kill them. No wonder aliens don't visit us, we're f***ed up.Anyways, I can't stress it more that you MUST see this movie. It's one of those movies you should see before you die. Even if it's your last day before you die because you have a critical disease or condition; you have to see this film. It will make your life and your death so worthwhile. You will die in awe. Definitely a blu-ray purchase in my books. 10/10 for a visual evolution, a breathtaking story and an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D..the way it was meant to be seen.",positive
133,"I will certainly not argue that this is a highly entertaining film. But again with a lot of films of this type recently, the script gradually takes a back seat to the visuals. The premise of the story is a good one, and I admire Cameron for giving us a relatively original plot from which to tell his story via CGI. However, there were still a few problems with the script. Like many of movies of this type, the script seemed a couple of re-writes away from being an absolutely phenomenal story. There were a few too many aspects that started ringing of Aliens and Titanic, both of which Cameron wrote and directed. And there were glaring holes in some of the story but instead the action sequences were overlong almost to cover-up the lack of development, particularly in regards to the mineral substance sought-after by the corporate baddies. The basic plot is pretty complex. American white capitalists are exploiting Pandora, a world that is a cross between the jungles of modern-day Africa, the world of the dinosaurs 100 million years ago, and the unpredictability of Wall Street. Some of the creatures that habituate the planet are crosses between dinosaurs, reptiles, mammals, and Enron Corporation. At one point a character says you could get a little rest and relaxation in Hell after being on Pandora. Nestled inside this wilderness are a race of green humanoids resembling something that could pass for an ancient African or Native American tribe with a little bit of Vulcan added for good measure, called the Na'vi. They reside inside a giant tree that would give the Empire State Building a run for its money. Trouble is the Tree (aka Hometree) contains a mineral that's supposed to be worth $20 million per 2"" x 2"" x 2"" cube, which would mean that one the size of a bowling ball would be enough to buy the entire state of Rhode Island or the estate of Bill Gates. But this is one of the holes in the script: What the hell is this stuff and why is it potentially worth more than all the that pops up on ""Antiques Roadshow"" and ""Pawn Stars"" combined? This is never explained. I think we are given only one line about the mineral and left to speculate ourselves, and the subject never comes up again. Of course this is a gaping hole as the whole premise is based on the immense desirability of this stuff! The man in charge of the corporate interests of the operation, Parker Selfridge, seemed a clone of Carter Burke from Aliens. (I notice their first names seem like a last names!) Like Burke he is only interested in the capital gain of mining the mineral. The native people, of course, are going to get screwed.A crippled soldier, Jake Sully, who lost the use of his legs in the Marines, is hired to place his consciousness inside an ""avatar"", a life-like replica of one of the Na'vi and infiltrate their society and culture to see if an agreement can be reached between the money-hungry corporation and the Na'vi. The agreement is the native tribe is being evicted from their Tree, without even a written 30-day notice. The better part of the film is Sully learning about the Na'vi. That aspect worked relatively well, although there were characteristics of the Na'vi that seemed so much like either idealized Native American or Ancient African culture that it was getting a bit deja-vu all over again. My favorite moment is the relationship between the Na'vi and the winged beasts, the Toruk, and how the Na'vi tame them. Later, the scientists discover that much of the planet is interconnected like a giant organism but again the idea is neither developed nor resolved.The baddies are led by a colonel who is so replete with over-the-top military cliché I half-expected to see him worshipping at a shrine to General Patton. He would probably feel right at home in the company of Atilla the Hun. (Again he was very similar to Cameron's character from Titanic, Spicer Lovejoy, who is just pure evil even when the ship is sinking! Without giving it away, there is a similar scene in Avatar.) Which points to what I think is the biggest problem I had with the final confrontation of the horrible white corporation with the wonderful Na'vi. The Na'vi seemed to have very little dark aspects to them and the baddies had almost no redeeming qualities barring the scientists and Sully. For those who like their bad guys and good guys very well-defined, this is your kind of movie.Unfortunately, I predicted the last 20 minutes of the film during the first 20 minutes. The ending needed something unexpected that also tied up the loose ends concerning the valuable mineral and the idea of interconnected consciousness of life on Pandora. I speculated that the corporation might earn greater profit from fostering this idea of interconnected consciousness, but nope. They don't listen to reason and simply go for the jugular. Probably the first one-half to three-quarters of this film were exceptional. The last quarter became a slash-and-bang shoot-em-up action video game. Sort of a Spaghetti Western in space. The ending needed to transcend itself to meet the very interesting rhetoric of the middle of the story. But of course that probably would have meant cutting down the action sequences, God forbid.",positive
134,"I believe in James Cameron, way back from the Aliens to Titanic he delivered a sensation or a magic. And his new magnum Opus, AVATAR is most entertaining,thrilling cinematic experience of my lifetime. Its mesmerizing, and Cameron crafted it wonderfully.The film focuses on an epic conflict on Pandora, Pandora is inhabited by an indigenous species called the Na'vi. Standing nine feet tall, with tails and sparkling blue skin, the Na'vi live in harmony with the natural world around them.The word Avatar is an ancient Indian word, with literal meaning of ""the Lord Vishnu taking another form, to counter the evil forces"". Here it refers to human scientists led by Dr. Grace(Sigourney Weaver) taking form of Na'vis with the help of Genetic engineering.Jake Sully(Sam Worthington), a marine, who replaces his brother on a mission to infiltrate the Na' vis on the planet of Pandora. During Jake's first assignment through the Pandora jungle, few wild creatures attacks him and becomes alone in that jungle, attempts to survive and steals the attention of Nytiri (Zoe Saldana) a Na'vi female.The Na'vi people decide to take Jake and teach him about their culture. As Jake learns the way of the Na'vi, he finds himself caught between the military-industrial forces of Earth and a newfound love for his adopted home and people. Believing that the Na'vi will never abandon their home, the humans attack and destroy the Hometree, forcing the Na'vi to flee. The Na'vi feel betrayed by Jake, ostracizing him from the tribe. Back at base, Jake and his compatriots are forcibly disconnected from their avatar interfaces and are detained for arguing against the destruction.Finally, with Neytiri's assistance, Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other tribes and lead them into battle with the increasingly violent human forces, in order to save their race and world, after the battle, the humans are forced to evacuate Pandora. To talk about the performance, all arrows from the Cameron's bow done an excellent job.Especially Nytiri, an electrifying performance, even Sam did an excellent job.I mean all are acted brilliantly. Visual effects is superb and hypnotizingAvatar offers not only Space war but also a drizzling love story between Jake's Avatar and Nytiri. Every scene offers you a thrilling Taquila. I added Avatar in my favorites list. I give 10 rating for James Cameron's Avatar because i cannot give less than that.",positive
135,"I'm not a very frequent moviegoer. But when I go, I usually choose a movie of which I have very high expectations. Not with this one. But I'm glad I saw it on the big screen.I only came along with some friends of mine who had been dying to see this movie ever since it was first mentioned in the media. I went in expecting a lame story with good visuals. I was right about the story. The main story is something I've seen a couple of times before. The main character needs to choose between good and evil. Good being the beautiful, primitive, agile and spiritual Na'vi and evil being the hostile, heartless human *ssholes. That works well for the average moviegoer but a little more depth in the story wouldn't hurt anyone. That being said I move on to the visuals. And that's what makes up for a whole lot of the simple story. I'd heard that it was a spectacular movie but it turned out to be spectacle unlike I had ever seen before. The Planet of Pandora is a fairytale-like world with beautiful, surreal nature. I saw the movie (like many others. It has been sold out for over a month now.) in 3D. That made Everything even better. When looking down a ravine you'll find yourself dizzy from the height and when in a mission briefing you'll be listening from the back row. Though I had expected more 3D-effects, When you see it, You see it good.I usually choose a deep, complex story over great spectacle but I'm happy I made this exception. This is the next episode in cinematic visuals.",neutral
136,"Avatar is a poorly written, and poorly acted animated movie. James Cameron directs Avatar like he would a TV movie. There's no real depth and no real emotion. The special effects aren't even all that great, and the 3-D is absolutely, 100% terrible.There's no ""experience"" while watching Avatar. It's like watching an animated film. I could hardly sit through it, but I spent a lot of money for the 3D so I forced myself to stay. The entire movie, aside from a few action sequences, is incredibly boring. Mostly because I don't have any reason to care about any of the characters on screen because they are also boring. I recommend that if you're going to see this, get it on DVD, don't waste your money on 3D. It's a cheap gimmick and I really hope it goes away. Avatar utilizes the 3D in the worst way, I felt like I was looking at a pop out book that I wasn't interested enough to finish.I don't really feel like there's much else to say. Avatar is just an extremely lame movie.*/****",negative
137,Easy one of the best visual films I have ever seen. The story line is perfect and the cig is just absolutely beautiful.Would definitely recommend this to anyone that has not seen it.,positive
138,"At last the moment has come which i have been waiting for about an year now... The most anticipated movie in recent times is finally out. To express my view in one line - AVATAR will divide cinema as we knew it so far into a pre-AVATAR and post-AVATAR era. All those people who appreciate cinema as an art will enjoy this experience. Ya its not a movie.... its an experience. James Cameron has proved beyond doubt that he is not only the king of the world but ""God of cinema"". Because even god could not have created such a beautiful world. I mean screw Monalisa... This is real art. The attention to detail is unimaginable. Every tree, creature, landscape is so stunning and nothing like you have ever seen before.Plot revolves round Jake Sully, an ex-marine who has lost his legs being sent to Pandora, a distant world full of exotic flora and fauna and large deposits of ""Unobtainium"", a rare earth mineral worth millions. Pandora has a native population called Na'vi who love nature and hence pose a threat to mining operations. Hence remotely controlled half human and half na'vi bodies are grown called AVATARs to mix with local Na'vi and convince them to relocate. Jake in his AVATAR understands Na'vi culture and human imperialistic attitude which could destroy the whole Pandora. Hence Jake needs to make a choice which will decide future of pandora.For those people who argue that the plot and few sequences are not new have to understand that the story and major portion of screenplay was written by JC in 1994. The story is interesting enough to keep you glued to the screens for 2 hrs 45 mins ( which is not a problem... I could have sat there for 3 more hours as movie was so damn brilliant). The story is very relevant for the present age of global warming. It is in no way preachy but sends a strong message.On the technical side, this movie is a sure milestone in cinema history. 1890 - Strongman Sandow(First motion picture) 1895 - The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots(First movie with special effect) 1918 - Cupid Angling(First colour movie) 1927 - The Jazz Singer(First Talkie movie) 1973 - Westworld(First movie with CGI) 2009 - AVATAR(Need i say more)The motion capture is so realistic that it pushes CGI technology to its limit. I saw the movie with a friend who did not know anything about avatar and he could not realise the Na'vi were CGI and not actors with blue paint on them. It is so photo-realistic. Spielberg, Peter Jackson try to match this if you can !!! And people who say it looks a bit video gamish, need to stop looking trailers on their 14' screens and check it out on big screen. I have never seen CGI with so much real emotion in it. The climax battle scene is the mother of all war scenes... It will blow your mind.Performances are equally brilliant. Sam Worthington is definitely the next big thing in Hollywood. He is almost flawless as Jake. He is tough and has a charm to pull off the child like nature of the character. As in every JC movie, female lead gets the best part and importance. Zoe Saldana is awesome as Neytiri. Its truly her year with two mega blockbusters in Star trek and AVATAR. Sigourney ""The queen of sci-fi"" Weaver is outstanding as Grey, the head of avatar operation. When JC meets Sigourney, its nothing short of magic. But the surprise package for me is Stephen Lang as Col.Quatrich, the tough head of security. This guy steals the show.This has been an year of really crappy big budget movies like transformers 2, Terminator Salvation and GI Joe to name a few. But thank god at least one guy in Hollywood knows how to spend money. Of course the man who has raised the bar of movie making so high all through his career that only he can out do himself - James Cameron. This guy knows how to create hype and most importantly how to live up to the hype as he has proved it time and again in his career. This is truly a JC classic in the ranks of Terminator and Aliens. Not only its technologically years ahead of its time but movie is emotionally very strong... Like the speech given by Jake to all Na'vi inspiring them to fight, made me get goosebumps. 12 years wait and I say its worth it. The movie is already nominated for Golden Globe and will surely be a front runner at the Oscars.This movie is meant to be seen in IMAX 3D ( or at least 3D). Its an experience you will remember for long time. It may not make as much money as titanic due to slightly less wider target audience. Even though it is the most expensive movie ever made, i am sure it will recover its budget in 2 to 3 weeks. Sure shot blockbuster. But more importantly it is this generations STAR WARS. Mark my words, people will talk about this movie even after 30 years...10 on 10 from me....",positive
139,"One of the best movies ever. There was the famous Mr. Gorbachev, who wrote in his book ""Perestroika"" the remarkable sentence: ""Capitalism is incapable of solving mankind's global problems"". We just witnessed Copenhagen, where the two most aggressive nations on this planet finally paved the way to global doom.Avatar shows us the extinction of the Native Americans by the first Europeans coming to America, it shows us the way the Aborigines ended after the English came to Australia, it shows us numerous ""smaller"" events, where the evil combination of a mighty military machine and insidious commercial interests. This combination (some call it fascism) will do everything to get its profit.I find it fascinating, that especially a nation like the USA, who can't kick militarism, is making such movies, watching such movies, enjoys such movies and ... continues exactly like they did before. Don't marines visit movies theaters? Don't managers visit such movies? We destroy everything. This process continues, it actually happens each and every day. Each day, ""Avatar"" happens on Earth. A little Pandora in every hour of our life. But since we don't watch it in 3-D in a movie theater, it doesn't bother us too much and our ""Na'vi's"" ain't always that perfect and pretty.So now we watch it in beautiful, magical pictures in a movie theater and the good ones win for once. At least until another profit-hungry corporation comes back and throws some ERW /neutron bombs on the Na'vi, because after that, they can continue making 20 Million bugs a kilo of something mineral - so we can buy more non-alcoholic beer and more blue jeans and more bankers can claim more bonuses.The movie is wonderful, but the victory of the Na'vi can only be considered a ""Little Bighorn"". Nothing more.For the few among us who know about Enlightenment, the movie pictures the Na'vi as beings living in a state of knowing who they are. This alone makes it worth watching the movie.",positive
140,"I simply don't have the words because none of those in the title of this review even remotely covers the total amazement that this movie gave me.Admittedly, my husband and I saw this in 3D so it took on a reality that it couldn't otherwise.Honestly, I've never had a reaction to a movie like I did this one. It did more than set me on the edge of my seat.I found myself alternately laughing, crying, cheering, and even shaking in anticipation with each new moment in the movie.I do have to say that it did take about a half hour or so to get into but after that, the world just disappeared around me.There are some definite societal overtones to this movie. It quickly became apparent that this was a social statement about what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans arrived on the continent. But its a statement that honestly cannot be overdone, as its happened to other society's too.The lesson is to learn from history, something that few seem to have done. If we cannot learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it, even if its to an alien race over a century in the future.Be that as it may, the story was still captivating.And rather than taking away from the movie, I found the CGI simply adding to it.It was so real. There are times I caught myself flinching as a stray ash or leaf moved through the image. Like I could reach out and touch what I was seeing.Simply and utterly incredible.James Cameron truly has a masterpiece unlike any I've ever seen. I only hope he gets his due at the awards shows this year, but somehow I doubt it. The awards shows never give it to anyone that actually deserves it when they actually deserve it.",neutral

142,"You wanna know something funny? Not even a year ago, early 2009, I was watching ""The Directors"" on the Reelz Channel and James Cameron was on. I was talking to my friend and saying how he is one of my favorite directors, he has an amazing track record of great movies, but wait, has he done anything since Titanic? I went on the net to check to see what he has done since Titanic and it says nothing but documentaries and he was working on a film called Avatar. I read a little about the movie and then a few months later came the trailer and I was just in awe. I was extremely curious to see this movie and couldn't wait as when we hear the name James Cameron, you can't help but expect nothing but greatness. The man is a perfectionist and it shows, he always goes above and beyond what he needs to do for a film and we got that with Avatar. My only complaint being like Titanic, the story not being the most original on the market, but I can't at all hate this movie. Originally wanting give this movie a 9 rating, I find myself thinking that I can't. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen in my life. My boyfriend and I saw this in 3D and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. James Cameron is back and I hope he never leaves Hollywood again as this was the breath of fresh air that we needed with Avatar.In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and use gas masks. In an attempt to improve relations with the natives, scientists create human-Na'vi hybrids called avatars, controlled by genetically-matched human operators. Jake Sully, a former marine, becomes a last-minute replacement for his murdered identical twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator. Dr. Grace Augustine, the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother, and relegates him to a bodyguard role. Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman on an exploratory mission in their avatar forms to make contact with the Na'vi in order to help establish diplomatic relations, solve the problem of resources and end the threat of violence. The group is attacked by a predator, and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's dangerous jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by Neytiri's clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at, the Na'vi shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior ""Dream-walker"", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways.I had another fellow IMDb user e-mail me a week ago asking me about my thoughts on the movie and he informed me that Cameron has been working on the story for years(many thanks to oldman007 for the info) and just now had the opportunity to work on it. I think that Cameron did a great thing by taking a break from movies as not only could he retire a good 25 times from the money he made on Titanic but we had an opportunity to appreciate him even more for Avatar. 2009 was kind of a lousy year for films and this was the movie that we needed to have that sigh of relief. From the actors, the special effects, the visuals, and the way the story is told was orchestrated like a perfect night at the theater with an standing ovation from the audience as everyone wanted more despite the 150 minute running time.I'm sure Avatar is sure to be in for the run during Oscar time, wither it gets a best picture nod or not, I'm not sure, but from what I've seen this does deserve every award it can get. I feel very bad if I'm over hyping the film too much for you, I don't want people to get the wrong idea that this is the Casablanca of the new millennium, but it really was just a relief that we still have potential in Hollywood to put out a great movie. Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana stole the show and I think the reason being is because Cameron can make females very strong, beautiful, but doesn't over do it with his actresses and always knows what he wants from them and they deliver. Sam Worthington as the leading man, Jake, I was a bit worried as I saw Terminator: Salvation which was like spitting in James Cameron's face, he was the star in that film too and I thought he was going to just suck the life out of this film. Thankfully I was wrong and he pulled in a strong enough performance to carry the film with some incredible actors beside him. Avatar is very much worth the look on the big screen, it's a masterpiece.10/10",positive
143,"It's very possible that this is an important movie in the field of CGI and 3D technology. In that category it is certainly a groundbreaking pioneer and it will have its followers. In fact it already has (life of Pi). The artificial world that was created was amazingly beautiful and imaginative. For this I give the movie all ten points.But in the movie industry there are different categories. More than half of the playing time - namely the scenes of the Avatar world - belonged more or less to the category of animated movies with CGI effects. It was made rather on the computer than it was behind the camera.The question is: shouldn't Avatar be treated and rated like an animated movie rather than a motion picture with real actors? Even animated movies and are judged as whole, not only for their outstanding visual execution.If you extract the whole high tech visual aspect of Avatar what is left of it?-average acting (except Sigurney Weaver) (- 1 point) -predictable story (- 1 point) -full of clichés: bad military people versus native peoples preserving nature (-1 point) -full of stereotypes: there are either good or bad characters (-1 point)If the Avatar world would have been replaced (and played) by some real Aborigines, this movie would have been neither noticed nor watched.I read somewhere that this movie is the equivalent for pop music hits: Today for the best tomorrow for the garbage.",neutral
144,"I was a bit hesitant to write a review after my first viewing of Avatar. But now after my third viewing, I am not shy in declaring that this movie will become a classic and remembered for its groundbreaking vista for as long time. We have become used to ""production"" movies coming out of assembly lines from Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movie houses that we almost forgot how wonderful a cinematic experience can be. Sure, there may have been other movies this year with ""more quirky"", ""more original"" stories but as a whole, Avatar is by far the best movie this year and in the top ten of best movie this decade. A classic is by definition something that you can enjoy as much if not more in the second, third, fourth viewing, and Avatar is definitely it. I don't understand the critic that this film lack story and emotion because it has all of it, even if a bit on the cliché side.",positive
145,"Well people, I would like to start off by saying that if you have seen this movie more than twice, you should really check your IQ (it might be lower than you've expected). The reason I say that, is that like most of the other modern super high graphics movies, this movie lacks a good story. I mean its just a complete mess, the plot is like 5 minutes, some idiot comes in the village speaking English, and they are like oh yeah dude we are just going to teach you ""our way"" out of the blue, not even caring where he came from or what he wants. Followed by boring 45 minutes of dragon flights, etc...I was yawning when I was watching it. The of course the savage fight scene, a cheesy love story, all that crap. Here's the breakdown of all the mess they've made:1) Terminator - Their sarge, a ruthless idiot. 2) Lord of the Rings - the Stupid tree the people live in, just blow up the tree..could have nuked it, but it's OK) 3) Alines - well that one actor whatever her name is, was from aliens and so did the space ships looked a lot like in that movie. 4) Matrix - guy in the tub, loading him to the avatar...oh jeez, come on people, it's not original anymore to be a copy cat(I am sure I forgot another movie they copied the stuff from, but that's OK. So I gave it a 6/10 because that's all it deserves for crap story and amazing graphics. But seriously don't see it more than twice, just because you are wasting your money. I'll get my BluRay copy of it, but that's about it.Adios!",neutral
146,"I heard that this film was going to be the benchmark in modern film making. I heard this film was to be the largest grossing film of all time, and perhaps even the most captivating. As a film lover I could not miss it, and to make sure I didn't miss out on everything James Cameron had to offer me, I saw it in the largest iMax cinema in England, in 3d. Keep in mind, I am now writing this review a week or so after seeing it so as to let my initial reactions subside and compose and sensible, rational and correct report on what I experienced, and yet my first words are still WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!Let me try and address this in an ordered fashion.Plot: Terrible, shameful and embarrassing. Not only to mention that it was almost an exact copy of Pocahontas (literally), it just wasn't at all interesting. You knew from the outset exactly how the film was going to end, it was cliché, boring and hamfisted from beginning to end. Anyone who can honestly say that the plot was captivating must be drunk, an idiot, or joking. Also, I know people go on about this, but seriously, UNOBTANIUM??? I understand trying to make a commentary on our endeavours as mankind, but calling the object unobtanium reduces the intellectual level to Sesame Street. Also, the fact that the Na'vi who could speak English went from relatively stunted English to perfect English and back again through out the film bothered me more than a little. And when the natives win that one battle, the humans, who desperately want this 'unobtanium' as it will make them all mindboggingly rich, and can afford to pay for whole armies to try and get it, give up? They just aren't going to come back? That's ridiculous, they'd nuke the place.Characters / Characterisation: Uni-dimensional to the end. No depth whatsoever. Prime example of this is the military captain who is, in all senses, a cartoon stereotype military captain, there was no reason or rhyme behind his actions apart from the fact that he is a military captain. The self-interested capitalist, who in the end was nothing more than a self-interested capitalist? No! Surely not! And the hero, who, from beginning to end, portrays no real traits that give him away to be anything other than a complete hero. Wow. I'm so impressed.Acting: No one captivated me. No one stood out. Even Sigourney Weaver, an actress who I usually hold in quite high esteem, was pretty poor. I blame Cameron.Special Effects: Yes. They were impressive. This is where my 1 star comes from. But, forgive me for being a bit of a traditionalist, but I think in any film no more than 1 star should ever be entirely devoted to special effects. That being said, they were impressive, they weren't biblical. It's not like I walked out of the cinema unable to speak from awe. Furthermore, aside from the technical quality of the special effects, the world itself was not that inventive, intelligently designed or beautiful. They were essentially in a jungle with a few animals that just looked like mutated versions of Earth animals. And some odd jellyfish type things. If you want truly beautiful films watch something like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"", I'd say both of these have more impressive scenery than Avatar does. Directing:Uninventive. Nothing really new there. Impressive shots of scenery perhaps, but pretty much normal camera-work throughout. A very cheesy montage to show the hero and his woman getting closer and closer. A standard battle scene. No James Cameron, not impressive.The bottom line is this, I know and you know that if it wasn't for its 3D effects, and the fact that it had James Cameron's name attached to it, Avatar would probably have been straight to DVD. Some people have said that people don't like it because they don't understand Sci Fi. That's ridiculous. I love Sci Fi, it's my favourite genre. But compared with classics like Alien, or 2001, this was an affront. So shame on you James Cameron, for insulting our intelligence by thinking that nothing more than pretty lights are needed to make a good film. Though, in the end, I guess you were right, as most people seem to be inexplicably raving about it. Maybe all people want in a film are just pretty lights, and that's pretty sad to see.Poor, poor show.",negative
147,"Reading through most of the reviews, people have graded it to what the movie deserved ""a high rating"". Though some people refused to consider it a great movie, mostly because it lacked in originality and did not live up to its extremely high expectations. To be honest the movie really wasn't revolutionary, it was just really good. Thus I still insist on giving it a good rating. The movie followed the same concept as many previous movies, being that mankind is evil and are aggressive consumers of worlds. The movie kind of represents symbolism for both the indigenous people being forced out of their land (Like the Colonist/ Indian conflict). It also represents our war in the sense that our ambition is a war in desire of oil, or supply. Indeed many movies in the past have based their meaning on these subjects, but what is wrong with repetition if the outcome is good? It is how the concepts are composed is what matters. And I believe that if any viewer of Avatar, will drop their boundaries; even a little, will like this movies. Granted the story did not consist of extremely deep meaning compared to the more popular and intellectual movies, but it still proved interesting. I must also add that some of the movies that critics claim Avatar to have stolen from I have not seen, thus I suppose their is an exception to have not liked this movie. Still I enjoyed the story and its' characters.Now as for the visuals, they were better than almost every movie I have seen, but not revolutionary. As I watched previews of this movie I noticed a blend between reality and animation, thus I had a high expectation of the movies' visuals. Unfortunately throughout the movie it was pretty easy to tell when it was animation and when it was not. It was like the matrix in the sense that when Jake entered the alien world you knew it was not real. Perhaps if the Na'vi were not as colorful, and in bright colors, my opinion would be otherwise. Despite that the visuals were still great. I must also point out that in this movie James Cameron has created an interesting and unique world, in which I compare to even Star Wars itself. The Na'vi are basically gargantuan humans with blue skin and elf ears, but still very cool to look at, even to be attracted too ""cough"" Neytiri. The creatures and even the futuristic technology expressed are simply amazing. So another great feature Avatar contains.Critics of this story would argue against its simplicity as it is a well known concept in terms of a war between natives and conquerors, but it doesn't mean the story was bad. Even if you argue that the main conflict lacked originality, James Cameron exposed other intriguing ideas, such as the transfer of ones mind to another body and even the metaphor between the internet and the planets forest. If you can not enjoy this movie, you are too critical and I recommend dropping your boundaries, for I assume you would dislike almost every movie, making your experience in modern entertainment rather dull, despite the exception I mentioned earlier. In truth this movie may not deserve a 10 maybe an 8 or 9, but I give it a 10 to counter those whom give it low ratings for almost ridiculous reasons. I highly recommend seeing Avatar to all people and hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.",positive
148,"I can't honestly say I am a huge James Cameron fan (Lucas and Spielberg hold that honor) but his movies never cease to give you more of what you want out of movies, an escape from the every day. Avatar does just that, takes you on one wild far out ride. The graphics are amazing; I was seriously sitting there trying to figure out what was real and what was not. It's hard, because it all fits together so seamlessly that you actually believe that Pandora exists and that you could really go there. Even the aliens looked real; the Sigourney Weaver Avatar LOOKED JUST LIKE Sigourney Weaver. Like she was wearing makeup or something like that. And let's be honest, who hasn't wanted to see Sigourney Weaver as an 8 foot tall blue alien? But this also made me think that if we have this type of technology now just think of what we could do!? Chris Farley in a movie with Humphrey Bogart? Who knows? The possibilities are limitless! Leave it to the creator of the Terminator to come up with this. This movie WILL change the way all future movies are made, of that there is no doubt.But as I watched a few things came to my mind that bothered me and I hope you will indulge me for a moment.....#1-Why is it that every movie that uses the military uses them as bad guys who are hell bent on killing and blowing things up? Once the main Colonel came on screen I said ""There's your 'Bad Guy'"" He fit the typical stereo type of military in movies to a T. Too over the top of you ask me, like a cartoon villain.#2-So the main brother dies and they decide to bring in the twin brother Jake to take his place, with no background information or training for this mission? This guy has no idea what he's doing, so what would the odds be of him getting there and being killed after the first day cause he had no idea what to expect? If the Avatars were so expensive you think they would spend more time to train him so he lives and gets the job done instead of throwing him into it and hoping for the best.#3-So this mineral is important, I get it, and they want it bad I get that too. But with the technology that the humans have why didn't they just dig under the tree? Why bother the locals if they are so hell bent against you? Use the Avatars to mine the mineral behind the locals backs and your problem is solved.#4-Michelle Rodriguez's character.....I get she was the 'Ripley' of the movie. But why is the 'rebel chick who will save the day' always the one in the tight fitting and rather revealing outfit? Also, half the things she wore cannot possibly be regulation military wear, if it is I wanna join.#5-Why did this corporation have the military there anyway? It was not a military operation, and you have big bulldozers that would easily crush the locals, so why bother with the Jarheads? #6-There was no plot. Sorry, but it's true. This was pretty much Dances with Wolves like everyone says. You can see it coming a million miles away. The first 20 minutes into Avatar and I knew where it was going. It was awesome to see and experience, but there was no reason to really be there.#7-Thank god they had that mind transferring tree thing, because Jake alienates himself from the humans to live with the locals. Hate to tell you Jake but you are still a guy in an Avatar body, what kind of life would you have living two lives? Would your human body really be able to take that for a long extended period of time? Did you think that through? #8-Seriously, was all the bombs and blowing up stuff REALLY needed? There had to be another way. That was too much. Committing genocide for some rocks? Dear lord, what will we become? Please tell me this is not because of global warming.There are others but just minor nitpicks from me and I won't bother you with them.Don't get me wrong, Avatar is an experience like no other, but you need to leave the rational part of your mind at the door, this is the type of movie that takes you away to another place but refuses to answer your questions when you're done.And that's all we want now a days anyway, a movie that will take us away from reality for a while.",positive
149,"There's a lot of gushing going on for this film, and rightly so. After a Summer of lackluster crap, along comes this magnificent film. For once the hype was actually deserved. I won't talk about the plot, this film is best seen with as little information as possible. I will say that I wasn't prepared for the experience, even as a jaded film-goer I was transported and yes, moved. I didn't expect the emotional impact, but Cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons, and he does so here masterfully.Some of the criticism lies in the ""surface"" quality of the plot, but again, Cameron has never made deep, cerebral films. Cameron is an entertainer, and thank God for it. This film is pure, futuristic, ahead of it's time escapism. I was absolutely floored.",positive
150,"This film is simply extradionary. nothing compares to it, Cameron has created an entire new world, with new creatures and even a new language.The story keeps you intrigued, you don't notice the 2 and a half hours and the battle scenes are simply sublime.i read a guardian review before seeing the film that gave it 2/5 and likened it to aliens but he should be fired from his job, really cant understand how anyone can not like this movie, even my gf who said it looked crap and they were smurfs ended up loving it and has agreed to see it again next week with me. The 3D doesn't go for the gimmicky pop out of the screen at you but instead just adds to the experience in a subtle way.A lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon saying how amazing Cameron is cause they have seen titanic, i loved Cameron's movies before i knew they were his. By the time i was 12, T2 and Aliens were my 2 favourite movies of all time before i even knew anything about directors etc, now avatar adds to that list.Quite simply see this movie, it is most definitely one that you will need to see on the big screen preferable in 3D for the full experience and if you don't have a blu ray player by the time this is released on DVD? GO GET ONE!",positive
151,"Avatar is the new feat of film-making. I would never have though James Cameron would have been able to pull this off, especially after all the hype. It's safe to say he did. While the plot is similar to other films, and despite many reviews saying that it's screenplay does not hold up to the weight of everything else in the film, I disagree. It's true that the screenplay is simple, but I found that is was a lot better than Titanic's screenplay, which really turned me off. But like most said, the screenplay is the least important aspect in this film, in a good way. It sets off this whole new vision that Cameron wants to bring to us. He does magnificently. The creature designs, visuals, sound, colors, and depth that everything has in Pandora is amazing, and I have never been transported into another world like I have with Avatar. Seeing it in 3-D was spectacular, simply spellbinding, and unforgettable. Everyone in the theater was in complete amazement at everything in this film, and for that, James Cameron has succeeded very well. He is a great director, and I hope he gets nominated for the Oscar at the very least. Avatar is the new feat of visual entertainment. It is one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best action films ever made.",neutral
152,"I will give Cameron credit for a visually stunning movie. I will say this movie did hold my attention for about an hour. But special effects and great CGI only carries you so far.OK first of all, I give James Cameron credit. He has surpassed all his prior films in creating a visual masterpiece. They were glorious and beautiful and he should be commended for that. You could even call the Special effects here groundbreaking. But it's sort of like looking at the Alps or Niagara Falls. While visually stunning, that's it. The rest of the film to me was a huge empty vapid wasteland, not well written and very predictable.First of all the story. What story. I could have rented Pocahontas if I wanted to see this story. There's nothing original here. And at least Pocahontas and John Smith were real people with layers and motives that were empathetic and relatable. Who are Jake and Neytiri. I found myself not really caring about them. The story is clichéd and has been done many many many times before. I found nothing groundbreaking about it. I guess if you are a teenager you probably will love it. Me not so much.And the acting? Who needs acting when you have CGI and CGI created characters. I fear for the future of actors.Now I admit I am no James Cameron fan but I do admit he created something special with Titanic although watching the special effects in that movie now more than 10 years later, they are laughable. At least Titanic had a semblance of a story. So in 10 years plus how will Avatar's special effect's hold up. This should not be on any ""BEst of a decade list or any top 200 film list. It won't stand the test of time. Compare this to a film like Aliens(which by the way Cameron made) which is still visually appealing, had a compelling story, well rounded characters, and fine acting and there is no comparison.I think another reviewer hit the nail on the head. Hollywood is continually trying to come up with ways to draw movie goers to the theatres. Since many people can sit in the comfort of their home and watch films on their surround sound big screen TV's how do we get them coming to the theaters. Create films with huge special effects that are 3D where you can only experience maximum impact on the big screen.Maybe these geniuses in Hollywood need to figure out why films like Julie and Julie, The Blind Side, Up in the Air are drawing in film goers, and these are not big special effects films. Just good films with good acting and decent stories. These are films that stand the test of time. I can watch films like Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Aliens, time and time again and never tire of them. Avatar, Titanic, zzzzzzzzzzzz.One last disturbing tone to this film. How soon will it be before CGI created characters take the place of real like actors. Thanks James Cameron I happen to adore actors bringing their personalities and takes on characters to a film.And I will reiterate I am not anti James Cameron. I adored Aliens.By the way who wrote the score and song for this film. Truly terrible.I give this film 5 stars for the special effects. That't it.",neutral
153,"Wow is really the only word to describe this movie. I haven't felt like this after a movie...ever. I left that theater and was disappointed that Pandora wasn't a real place. The land scape is utterly breath taking in every way, it is everything your imagination can imagine and more, amazing in a sense I can't relay to you. I don't care what you have planned or how you can't afford it. Cancel what you have to and find the money! People are saying that the plot is mediocre, trust me, that's not what this film is about. I wish there was more! Even in the 2 and a half hours I was there I felt like I experienced a completely different life/world. Absolutely a must see for anyone with an imagination. SEE THIS IN 3D!!! You HAVE to see it in 3D, everything comes alive, you become a part of the surroundings. Most amazing movie I have seen to date.",positive
154,"I did not buy into the hype for this movie, I didn't pay attention to any of the previews or trailers. when I went to see it, I didn't expect to be blown away. I was. this movie might be Camerons best ever. that includes T2 and alien. some of the Na'avi looked so real it gave me the creeps. it was just phenomenal the way characters were developed and the way the forest was so alive. I am totally impressed by this movie and think in the future Avatar will be held up to such movies as star wars and the matrix I'd give it a ten, but I never give tens (except for 2001: a space Odyssey)",neutral
155,"*Possible Spoilers Ahead* Just came out of Avatar's Australian debut, certain cinemas decided to show an advanced screening in 3D (on 16/12/2009).What follows is a story & visual effects that are mind boggling. The story is a mix between previous Hollywood films, a cross between The Last Samurai & The Last of the Mohicans, among a few others. But the story is where the similarities end.Put simply, James Cameron, has & will always be a visionary for Hollywood along with anyone remotely connected to the science of making movies. ""Avatar"" will be used as a benchmark for future 3D films. 2D looks like a thing of the past.Sam ""Worthy"" Worthington deserves all the praise one can muster, his unquestionable work ethic and honesty will lead him to be one of the most successful actors of this generation. I do not tag Sam ""Worthy"" for nothing - without his dedication to the role of Jake Sully, this movie would have been grossly incomplete.The star of ""Avatar"" is BLU-JAKE (his alter ego - or what I shall refer to him - not surprisingly the so called ""AVATAR"" himself), however the character of Blu-Jake has been compared to having the morals & dilemmas of Captain Nathan Algren (T Cruise's character in ""The Last Samurai""). The dilemma over who & what is right or wrong, and using that as a benchmark to judge himself - What looked to me like a character struggling with inner conflict.The story revolves around humans wanting to take advantage of a mineral on the distant planet Pandora, although with disastrous results.As ""Jake Sully"" mentions in the trailer ""The Strong Prey on the Weak"" is the major theme of the film, and how the so-called ""weak"" choose to fight back with the help of nature.Possibly the best film in recent years. Cameron NEVER FAILS to deliver and we wait for AVATAR 2 & 3 with eager anticipation, let's not keep it another 12 years, Jimbo :D If the AMPAS fail to honor the film for Best Director & Best VFX at the 2010 Oscars, they may as well be shooting themselves in the foot, for credit ought to be given when it's due.I happily rate the film a full 10.",positive
156,It's too long. Really overrated. Honestly wasn't super impressed.,neutral
157,"I have completely lost all hope in Hollywood. This movie was horrible. There was no originality in the plot or the characters whatsoever.Let's look at the movie in it's entirety. Original right? NO! The truth is, if you strip away all of the special effects and look at the plot you'll notice that it's the same plot used in so many other movies. I've summed the plot up into one sentence. This is the plot: It's Disney's Pocahontas substituting the American Indians with blue aliens. What is so special about that? James Cameron is overrated as a director. Everyone is calling him the greatest director of our time. I hope the people calling him that, aren't speaking for all of us. I'd like to see him direct something with some kind of meaning to it instead of blue aliens fighting humans over a tree. Steven Spielberg, in my opinion, is the greatest director of our time. I will say that the performances given by Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver were amazing! Everyone else was so-so.There was nothing special about this movie. I literally feel like I wasted two and half hours of my life and thirteen dollars of my hard earned money to see this piece of crap.I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy.",negative
158,"At first, I was rather skeptical of the movie, I heard Avatar and thought 'The Last Airbender'. Then I saw a trailer and became enamored with the movie. Then, when I went to see the film, it lived up to my expectations and them some. Granted, the plot is not the strongest feature of the movie, but it is there and it makes everything flow along nicely. The important characters get plenty of screen time and are all pretty likable, especially the main antagonist, Colonel Quartich. Okay, maybe likable isn't the right word, but he's cool. And extremely BA, because who would kick out an airlock to shoot at people? Or barely reacts to being on fire? Anyways, none of those people are the real star of the show. The world, Pandora steals that title. It's a rich, alien world that will be a feast for the eyes. The wildlife is familiar in concept, but completely alien. Also, one last thought. While the wildlife looks absolutely amazing, so does everything else in this movie. The machines, the Na'vi, the world, the people. All of it looks fantastic. And, shell out the extra money to see this in 3d, ignore the headache, and prepare to be amazed.",positive
159,"First I would like to state that this is my actual opinion. I am not putting in an extreme to try to balance off everybody else as seems so prevalent in these reviews. I put my money where my pen is so to speak. So first I will provide evidence that this is my actual opinion: My wife and I VERY seldom watch TV, but we do watch 3-4 movies/week. So although we do have a life outside of watching movies, we have literally watched thousands of movies. I have a sizable investment in home theater gear, so we do not feel compelled to go to the theater very often (a couple times a year). When we do, we are normally content to wait until the DVD is released to see the movie again (if ever). Prior to this, there was only one movie I had EVER seen more than once in the theater. That movie was Star Wars and although many of my contemporaries saw it 11 or more times, I was content to see it twice in the theater. Tomorrow, we are going to see this movie the third time in 3-D (I won't see it in 2-D because I can do that over and over again in my home when the DVD comes out.) and I am not ruling out seeing it yet again before it is pulled from the theaters. This shows a landmark change in my viewing patterns and I believe that I can be believed that I am rating it a 10 because I feel it is a landmark movie rather than trying to have an inordinate sway on the overall ratings.The movie was visually stunning, quick paced and quite a bit of fun to watch. It was a superb MOVIE.There are quite a bit of other reviews summarizing the plot and key points, so I will address some of the negative points.Many have said that the plot was very simple. While this is true, science fiction and fantasy have a hard time adapting to the screen if they have an overcomplicated plot. The reason is that much of the movie time is used to explain the framework. This could be technology or magic or whatever variables make up this fantastic world. The alternative is to have a movie that cannot stand on its own. ""Dune"" and ""Battlefield Earth"" were both excellent books with too much plot to make a good movie. Simple plots with well developed frameworks tend to make the best sci-fi/fantasy movies such as ""The Thirteenth Floor"", ""Soylent Green"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Even ""Star Wars"" is very simple if evaluated only by its premiere movie. It is only after several movies that a more complicated fabric emerges. That is why stable ""Universes"" such as ""Star Trek"" are common. Once the framework has been developed, then relatively short stories can be more complicated since the framework doesn't have to be explained over again.There have been several objections to the use of ""unobtainium"" as a ludicrous name for a material. ""Unobtainium"" is not new to this movie. It is a common engineering/fictional concept that has been around at least since the 1950s (see the Wikipedia article). It even has its own symbol (Uo). It is funny. Get over it.There have also been several objections to the faculty that the aliens have with the English language. Excessive use of subtitles would detract from the movie far more than frequent usage of a non-existent language would.There have been objections that the movie is predictable. OK, it isn't a who-done-it, and being unpredictable is not required for a show to be good. I absolutely love the BBC ""The Blue Planet"" series, and all of the fish behave exactly the way I would expect them to.My advice is if you want cerebral sci-fi/fantasy with exotic locations and complex plot lines, read a book. If you want a wonderful trip into an exotic land watch this movie. I think it is beyond compare and the box office seems to indicate that I am not alone.",positive
160,"I sat through these nearly three hours of Avatar and I have to admit I really liked it. I didn't want to see that movie, because I'm a bit disappointed by American cinema lately, but my brother was psyched, so I joined him.At first: We saw that movie in 3d, but I doubt this feature adding something special to the experience of the movie. However there were some scenes worth watching in 3d, but I could really have spared the expense without missing anything.And that's due to the fact that there was so much to see in that movie, that you forget about 3d really soon and concentrate on the beautiful work of the landscape design artists. There are so many ideas being realized in that Pandora nature. So many details that create the feel of a complete world rather than what you see elsewhere, when they have some pretty ideas, but use magic plot holes to bypass the logical flaws.Avatar takes its time to tell its story. That means you have to watch it really long. I mean if someone tells you a really good story, you can listen to it for three hours, but of course: This is a long time. Sure this time is never wasted, but tends to address different 'moods': Sometimes it's extensive action, sometimes it's just visual entertainment ('watching the beauty of Pandora'), sometimes revealing emotions etc.The story itself I consider to be an Anti-War-Statement. And it's the best I have seen in American cinema until now. Saving Privat Ryan was good to show that war is on your own expense too. But Avatar concentrates on the question: ""Does, just because you have a gun, mean you're right?"" or alternatively ""Is your way of living the only one worth trying?"". Of course this is a bit of a cliché and the bad guy in the movie is a really bad ass bastard, so if you side with the natives you'll really love to see his payoff. And that's somehow exploited I think.Overall Pandora is my favorite movie in the categories: Anti-War-Movie and Oh-My-God-3-Hours-Movie.Watch it if you have enough steadiness, if you can stand more than the one 'mood' that is action and if you're not offended by an offensive Anti-War-Statement.",positive
161,"I have been a regular on IMDb for many years. i did not however venture onto the Avatar discussion board before this was released and I am disturbed to see such insanity from both sides of the camp.People are destined to hate this, out of jealousy or some some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. People are also destined to love this movie, many of you here have been in love with the film for years strangely enough! Whether you are a hater or a fan, the only opinion that counts is from the guy who didn't sit in either camp, who didn't give a damn when he walked through those cinema doors! I have been a lover of movies for years. When I watched Gladiator at the age of 15 I was hooked on films. I rarely dislike a good movie and I always dislike a poor one. Avatar was given 261 minutes of my full attention, would the movie speak to me I wondered? Would I understand it's language? Or would I leave unimpressed?Avatar, as we speak, is about to smash pirates and Lord of the Rings from 2nd and 3rd place on the box Office podium. Cameron will occupy the top spot for another 13 years and in my opinion, Titanic will be displaced! Counting inflation, Avatar will turn out to be the biggest movie of all time!I have reserved some judgement aside, based on the fact this was my first 3D viewing since 3D became the new sliced bread. I liked the format during the trailers and I was impressed at how much it had come along in recent years. I had a basic knowledge of the Avatar plot, through the trailers and the odd article. Avatar is high end concept for the most demanding and critical movie going audience in history - it needed the execution of the most high end director. Within 20 minutes, Cameron seeks to immerse you in Pandora, in this strange world, in his dream! As a fan of historical epics, I was amazed at the sheer grandeur of Avatar, the scale and magnitude of it's environments is beyond compare - the 3D working overtime to blow you away.The story is great, very basic good vs bad with a hint of The Last Samurai but by know means repetitive or prosaic in any way. We understand how Jake can fall in love with his new surroundings and we realise the ulterior motives of the humans from the offset. Pandora is an incredible experience because it takes you places that your imagination rarely manages in a dream! An charged forest habitat, lighting up, speaking to the navi. The creatures at one with the natives. A paraplegic in pandora can stand, he can walk and run, and he can fly! The dragon-like creatures give us the most stunning aerial views of the planet as well as show case the power of 'The Hive' (Jackson's Weta computer sound stage responsible for the live cgi we see) and what it brings to our eyes. It beggars belief that this was not possible a decade ago and now a new door had been discovered, unlocked and fully opened.As Jake spends his days and nights learning the way of the Navi, so forms the love story. War does not come without love, or without a woman. Tried and tested formula, but not a dead one seeing as this love is between a human and Navi. The idea is brilliant and it becomes more dream-like as the story progresses - only when in the MRI scanner can Jake fly through the trees with Neytiri and forget about his mission. The viewer is left in pain because of the sheer unconventional means the two characters can interact and be with one another. The ending serves as a delight to those with more interest in the forming love story. however before we get to the end, we are subjected to the most stunning intergalactic battle committed to cinema in recent times, perhaps in all time. Never has the impossible looked more real!On a human level, the emotions run wild. On a visual scale, we are left breathless. And on a personal note, 10 years after being blown away by Gladiator, I remain in complete awe of what can be done when someone has a special idea and stands by it. Cameron will not repeat his success here, truly the stuff of dreams.I was sceptical when I went to see Ridley's masterpiece, which for the last 10 years has remained my favourite film, as I never though a film could speak to me in the manner it did. Now I have been captivated by Avatar, I got that feeling once more and I understand it's language. If Avatar is a failure, then it is a failure which towers above any other movies successes!",positive
162,"I just can't believe Avatar is a ..movie. I was trying to watch the super-cool special effects I've been told about but all i could saw was a big --$--. Cheap actors, cheap everything... all the money went in things made by computers. I can't believe people actually felt in love with the avatar's world... it's just.. disgusting. Nice i tough... a reflection of how our world its stupid enough to turn heaven into hell fastly. but arrrr. they try to make a new Jesus with the principal actor.. hes not one of them but hes the hero.. the legend of their world... its an American- bible... to blind people with visual effects and a meaning-lookalike... this is bullshit... i felt the same way i feel when i watch Nazis propaganda shortcuts against jew around the 30s-40s",neutral
163,"""Avatar"" is billed as an action, adventure and fantasy film. While it is all of these, it's basic plot and makeup is all science fiction. There's no doubt about the fantastic technical and production qualities of this film. It's a joy just to watch the colorful scenes, sets and creatures of Pandora. CGI clearly has gone to the next level in creating backdrops, sets and scenes for use with live action filming. This is very good fantasy stuff. With so many reviews already, I won't rehash what others have said. But, I didn't see reference in the comments I scanned to a couple of things worth noting. So, this is to add them to the discussion of this film. A number of others are critical of the film for its lack of originality. It's true that the same themes of the genre of sci-fi and space exploration have been used a great deal before. The earth has depleted its resources and must find new ones somewhere else. The indigenous creatures of Pandora have their own deity. So, this film has considerable mythology. The new type of bionic man comes into this one with a scientific melding of human and something else. The humans are aliens to this planet or moon, and there is the usual division of some who care about the natives and others who couldn't care less about them. Much less often, fantasy and sci-fi films will use a writing trait found in classical literature. That is symbolic names and other words. Two leap out in this film. The first is the moon's name, Pandora. From Greek mythology, Pandora's box (or jar) today refers to a plethora of things that can cause havoc or problems. That fits this movie all too well. The second obvious symbolic word is the name for the rare mineral that earth needs, ""unobtanium."" So, it can't be obtained on earth or elsewhere.What is a somewhat unique about ""Avatar"" is that it combines all of the above aspects of sci-fi and more. But with so much action and all of the visual spectacles, it makes a plot that is very difficult to follow. When I came out of the theater after seeing this film the first time, I thought about the splendid visual show it was, but also wondered if there was any real point in the plot. It seemed to be just a complex story made to pull together many scenes of action, visual treats, and wild fantasy and sci-fi things. Watching it again, the visual spectacle is still there, and the plot fades. So, this isn't a film that would be recognized for the original and main crafts of theater - acting and directing. A good analogy might be with what Americans enjoy every year in celebrating the Fourth of July. Whoever tires of watching spectacular fireworks displays? We don't think about the theme, or the reason or the history at that moment. And, year after year we turn out to watch the fireworks again. ""Avatar"" isn't so much a movie or film with a great story and actors performing in it. It's just a spectacular fireworks display on the silver screen.",positive
164,"Most people have heard about this movie, and how it's got groundbreaking cinematics and will ""change the way movies are made and watched."" I'm not sure about all that, but I sure liked it.Please don't be fooled into thinking this is an action movie. There are a couple ""chase"" scenes, and one major ""fight"" scene. The rest of it is breath-taking CGI and plot development.Yes, there are several heavy-handed messages about imperialism, capitalism, pollution/destruction of the natural environment, and even a religious message or two. But these are secondary to the main story, which is a love story. If you are willing to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the story, it is a magical experience. I NEVER see movies multiple times in the theater; I've seen Avatar twice, and WILL be purchasing the DVD.",positive
165,Well i just happened to see the screening of avatar as i work with movies. We happened to get avatar and I must say the movie delivers...Not just on an aspect of story telling and intense moments but on pure entertainment and visual bliss. I am not much into Hollywood movies but for James Cameron I will make the exception of writing this review. It is just what the doctor ordered for this year of pathetic Hollywood movies. I just cant wait to watch it in 3D the following weekend but James Cameron still hasn't lost his masterful touch.Its great to see how the movie turns out to be so great and the way in which the plot turns.I wont give away anything and the plot is pretty much explained in the previews that you would have definitely seen. Just remember the cgi is brilliant and Cameron yet again has given us a glimpse of tomorrow today.,positive
166,"I just saw 'Avatar' from sridar,our dear theatre.I was astonished by this movie.James cameron is the most futuristic director ever born in this world & Avatar is the most advanced movie you'll ever come across.I cant think of a world beyond Avatar.It shows you the farthest limit of human imagination.The story & screenplay is so superb that you'll scream out after the movie saying 'I am blessed to see Avatar'.Its a masterpiece in movie-making. Don't compare it with classic dramas.Because all the action in Avatar is happening out of this world.So change the way you think.You'll love this movie.Everything goes well in this movie.The Highlight being the special effects.The world 'Pandora' is amazingly beautiful.Sam worthington cements himself to the big league.Joe zaldana was also the pick out.Nice background music thanks again to James horner.All i have to say is three words, Hip Hip Hurray........ 10/10........",positive
167,"I rated Pocahontas 7. Wonderful songs, beautiful artwork and captivating voice actors with clear environmental message.Avatar is just a simple pretty movie for kids. Its PG. And perhaps that is why it lacks philosophical subtext, true romance or any plot twists. The movie is not ""bad"". Like 'Finding Nemo' or 'Fern Gully', the high contrast vivid colours of Pandora are pretty to look at. The levitating rocks of Pandora ensure no scene is scoffed at by the viewer as ""implausible"".Yet, like many older viewers, I find it lacking.1. No plot twists of any kind. No subplots even. Jake arrives. Jake learns to be Navi while not revealing what will happen to last minute. Jake betrays military commander to help save Navi. The End.2. The military white guys lose to the ""natives"".Its frustrating that despite giving him 3 months, and many ""warning shots"", the white military is portrayed as the bad guys.3. Firepower? The military's futuristic ""advanced"" technology defeated by bow and arrow? No radar? No smart guns? How about some actual armour? --spoiler-- The ending is sort anti-climactic. Jake as the Avatar leads neighbouring tribes to their quick and pointless deaths - yet this is portrayed as a happy ending. Avatar suggests that ""soft military"" presence and diplomacy are flawed. Only aggressive attacks work.4. What is the point of the Avatars? The Navi immediately know Jake is not real Navi. Either way the Navi don't trust outsiders. Why the deception? Wouldn't human contact be simpler. Would also perhaps allow at least 1 hr for negotiations instead of 3 months of vine swinging.5. Navi never know WHY they are being attacked. Jake never explains and neither does Grace. Only that ""they are coming"". Hundreds of years into the future no technology to dig under HomeTree? How about other deposits? I just find it difficult to imagine mankind beginning right away with deforestation on Pandora after leaving a desolate Earth devoid of plant life.",positive
168,"The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.1 star out of 4",negative
169,"In my 27 years of life I've had the pleasure of watching truly great movies like Blade Runner, Braveheart, and The Lord of the Rings to name a few, but all of them pale in comparison to Avatar. I have no doubts Avatar is the greatest movie of all time.Avatar is set in a future in which the humans have destroyed Earth. Through their travels in space they found a planet full of life and a very valuable metal. Unfortunately the rich deposits of that metal are buried underneath an encampment of an alien race indigenous to that planet. The humans have been trying to convince the natives to move out, but the natives don't want to.To better communicate with the natives and to attempt to win their trust, the humans have engineered a hybrid body composed of human and alien DNA, a body that looks very similar to that of the aliens. The humans are able to link up a human mind to that hybrid body, and control it like if it were your own body, sort of like how you'd control a character in a video game, hence the name of the movie, Avatar. But this is even better than that, even better than virtual reality because the body you control is alive.After years of communicating with the aliens and being unable to convince them to move out, the humans send in Jake Sully, an ex marine. Will he be able to convince them to move out? You'll have to watch and see.The picture quality is amazing, the rain forests, the futuristic human technology, the indigenous animals and people of the alien planet, everything looks wonderful and real. The sound effects are equally great, you'll feel like you're in an exotic rain forest. Mel Gibson's Apocalyto did a great job at making you feel like you're in the middle of a wonderful rain forest, but Avatar goes well beyond that.This is the first time I've watched a movie in Real D 3D so I can't make a comparison with other 3D movies, but the experience was breathtaking. You'll be dodging things thinking they're coming straight at you. You'll feel like you're in the middle of an incredible ceremony with hundreds of people. I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the movie, but believe me when I say you really don't want to miss out on a chance to see this movie in 3D. What an incredible experience, I can't wait to see it again, I'm definitely seeing it again tomorrow.",positive
170,"Beyond the storyline there is something very valuable. This Film really demonstrates to me the importance of recognizing beauty in the world. Lets all wake up and see the beauty in our own world, in our relationships, in our daily tasks. Lets make life sacred again. Lets live through our fears and not reside in comfort. Embrace life and fill ourselves with love until it overflows into the world. Lets create heaven on earth! I know there are people who would not agree with my views; however, its all in the eye of the beholder. Obviously this film has flaws, maybe the story is not very original, or the script for that matter. To me this film didn't need to be perfect. I feel it is a timely work of art that represents where we are as a species. We are at a place where the way we are living isn't working anymore. Disconnected from the earth, disconnected from each other, we are starving for a more raw genuine way of life. A world where giving is as important as receiving, and we understand the connection we have with our environment. If we all think of the earth as a being, or an organism, then we the people are like the bacteria. Some bacteria are helpful and some are harmful. Just like in our own bodies, when there is a harmful bacteria the body attacks it! Think about natural disasters or disease! The earth needs our love. If we treat it well..it will treat us well. No movie has ever addressed this issue so masterfully.",positive
171,"Let me start by clearing a few things up. Avatar is the kind of film you have to see in the cinema to enjoy it fully ( and in 3D if possible). I was lucky enough to stumble upon the film a few months ago and foolishly dismissed it. Then two days ago me and a few of my friends were on our way to see 2012 and got stuck buying food and so were very late. We decided to skip 2012 and go see Avatar instead.A full 165 minutes later I walked out of there fully convinced of that James Cameron is a certified genius. The amount of detail in the world that he has created for the Na vi (the blue people) is astounding. The level of colour and detail draws you in like nothing I have ever experienced and the 3D really is incredible.Now the main point the critics of the film focus on the storytelling and its slow pace towards the beginning . Now not only is this an unjust and misleading comment but it is a total lie. The film sets up a beautifully crafted story that demonstrates the power of human emotion and what happens when we loose site of it. There was not a single moment in the film where I was wondering what was happening or why and I doubt that any director could fit such a breathtaking story into anything less that 2 hours 30 minutes. It once again proves Cameron creative genius and gives us a terrifying insight into the path that humanity is taking and what we will become. He has always tried to highlight this in his past films with Carter Burke in Aliens and Caledon Hockley in Titanic, both portraying the bastard capitalists.There are very few things that can be leveled against this film but I do not believe that I can think of any. In my view Avatar is not just the best film I have ever seen but the best cinematic experience I have had in my 15 years in this world.",positive
172,"This comment is on the IMAX 3d version.There aren't many stories, are there? There are not many good storytellers either. Nor, it turns out, many filmmakers who can make even moderately big movies with a single governing imagination. That is the first quality I will report of this: that a single mind governed the creation and dynamics of this world and how we see it. The second quality is the experience of realism in the artificial faces. Both of those are reported by others well enough.What really impressed me was how deeply the philosophy of WETA has penetrated grand film-making. They did the world. Now, the world by itself would be remarkable. But Cameron clearly wanted the dimensionality of ""King Kong"" writ large. The thing is dimensional. The camera is placed in positions that no physical camera could; it moves in ways that are distinctly alien in the alien sections of the movie; the sequence of surrounding shots in a scene, particularly an action scene, is more than double what you normally would get and surrounds. The way it surrounds is taken from what WETA did with ""Van Helsing:"" the movements are those you see in the flight movements of the flying dragons. So they are of the movie and in the thing as well.There is, therefore, a distinctly Australia-New Zealand flavor to this. That isn't the only nontraditional self-referential bit. Cameron loves these. We have the filmmaker to the film as the same as the otherworld immersion set up and controlled by Weaver's character. And indeed she reports that she modeled her character on Cameron. The bit about the forest as a neuronal net is not entirely unlike what visionaries in the computer graphics world talk about having in the future.A significantly unsettling element is the weaponry. Somebody boot ILM out of the game. It is really likely that a future that can master space travel and DNA remoting is likely to rely on Viet Nam era things-that-shoot? The only reason they are there is so that for the final battle we can have traditional cinematic shootouts overlain on our by then well established dimensional reality. And gosh, have we had enough already of the enhancer suits? Though I cheered and cried with the crowd, I wish I could have left feeling that love story was unpolluted by the ordinary. One thing that I will predict. I trace the use of orreries and global machines in films, because it affects the vocabulary we can use in how we grow the cosmologies behind noir. Here we have the trees. One is huge and helical, a home to a population. It is downed like the World Trade towers by a guy out of central casting that in other theaters we are cheering because he is blowing up terrorists. Here he says he is fighting terror preemptively with terror.The second tree — the tree of souls — is not rendered well visually. But the idea is an amazing advance in film scriptology. It moved me as the guiding principle behind the inevitable love. That it collected the soul of Cameron's avatar was a bit delicious. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",neutral
173,"Avatar is an important cinematic achievement. To dismiss its groundbreaking visual effects is just as bad as forgiving its lack of plot development and weak dialog. The movie will usher in a new era, for good or bad, of technical achievement in film. The 3-D is amazing and the special effects are on a scale that Lucas could have only dreamed about. But, like Lucas in his prequels, so much time is spent depicting the story that (it seems) no one really bothered to ask if the story was worth telling to begin with. Imagine if Avatar had been as powerful as 2001. Imagine if the story were just as awe inspiring as the images racing before your eyes. That would have been a true movie masterpiece. Because, in the end, no matter how good the movie looks, the visuals only exist to bring the story to life.",neutral
174,"""Avatar"" might be one of, if not the best movies ever made. Like James Cameron's last film ""Titanic"", it's a powerful and sweeping epic that goes to unbelievable lengths to wow us and amaze us. Some people are going to say that the story is rubbish, the dialogue is trash, and it's only a technical achievement, nothing more, nothing less. But they are wrong. The movie exceeds on every level possible, and while the impact could be considerably less in 2 dimensions, it still holds up as one of the best movies ever made.Cameron has perfected his three dimensional technology, and if you never see this in 3 dimensions, you are not seeing the director's extraordinary vision. I've never seen anything like this before in my life, and neither will you. I honestly have never seen a 3D motion picture in my life until Avatar, and when my theater finally had 3D technology, I considered seeing ""Up"" in 3D, but decided I would wait until ""Avatar"" to pop my 3D hymen. Boy, I do not regret this decision one bit.Yes, what you have heard is true, ""Avatar"" is the future of cinema. It's a complete game changer for Hollywood, and it has redefined the industry. There is no doubt in my mind there will be as many and maybe even more flocking to see this like Titanic 12 years ago. What's even better, is that while it revolutionizes Hollywood as an awesome technological achievement, it also packs a really damn good story, too.It does have a political message, but it's a very universal one everyone can accept: While human beings do some pretty damn amazing things, we also do some really horrible things. We burn down our own forests, we fight wars with each other, and we destroy each other's lives. James Cameron relays a message that is both powerful and a wake up call, and he's embedded it brilliantly into a film that is going to be seen by everyone. I hope this movie changes people, because I certainly think it has the ability to do so.While Cameron uses the technology to wow us, he also uses his story to pull at our emotions. I won't lie, there are scenes that do have the ability to make grown men cry, and it's important to realize that most of these scenes don't even involve the humans. The alien race known as the Na'vi are probably even more human than we are, which even adds more realism to the completely computer generated characters. This does not feel fake, this feels absolutely real. Thank god for that.This movie also runs at 2 hours and 40 minutes long. However, this is not one bit like the other movies this year that nearly push the 3 hour mark (i.e. ""Transformers 2"", ""2012""), and what's funny is that once it's over, you will have wished for more. Not many movies can do this, especially if they are long, but I can tell you that this movie does not drag once, nor does it feel like it is nearly 3 hours. If anything, it feels as though that it is too short. Try getting a hallmark card for that.From its opening scene to its closing shot, this is a truly beautiful, remarkable, and amazing film. There's no other film I would want the first decade of the 21st century to close on. The most important thing is, you have to see this movie to witness the most important part of what will soon be the history of 21st century Hollywood, and we have James Cameron to thank for this. Bravo, sir, bravo.",positive
175,"*** contains minor spoilers *** visually, WERA has pushed film further than i imagined possible since the first LOTR film debuted a decade ago. the action is pure Cameron - very entertaining and visceral. i didn't even mind the weak and hackneyed characters (many of which make a return from Cameron's ""aliens"" including the bad-ass Latino marine chick (she even goes out in a similar way) and especially Giovanni Ribisi's reprisal of Paul Reiser's greedy bastard: Carter Burke) what i found difficult was the film's recycled elements of Cameron's career, some mainstream science fiction, a couple of video game plots, all centered around a story we've watched/read/played so many times already we're totally numb to it.the audience, root for the na'vi (all alien or fantasy races must have an apostrophe in their name, it would seem), completely ignore who the bad guys are.we are asked to think it is the humans of some distant future, the heartless corporate machine that none of us have anything to do with.oh really? that corporate machine is the very one that pumps out these ""blockbusters"" and all the associated merchandising. the real enemy is us. the now us. not a future, removed us. not some us that the current us are not responsible for just as we shun all responsibility for all the damage and evil our ancestors have done. the consumers who bends to the will of the corporation now and who leave the theater and go to the local burger king to eat cow (a once living sentient being the life of which a real na'vi would have respected (when was the last time you thanked a cow for providing you with a tasty burger made from its flesh?) and incidentally whose harvesting is the number one cause of deforestation of the planet earth which in the film is hinted to be devoid of green) and buy avatar toys made in china and of materials and via processes that simply add to the destruction of the planet (just as, in the ultimate irony, i once saw a box of no longer wanted wall-e toys discarded by a dumpster)...if only Cameron had the guts to give some ""humanity"" to the humans, to make the conflict a little gray. to make the audience see - it is people like us, not single minded soldiers, who are killing the na'vi. and lets not make the na'vi so innocent either. like the European conquest of America and it's natives, no one was blameless...it's pointless to lecture tho. in Cameron's world black is black and white is white and besides, he didn't make this film to make the audience think or pass on a moral lesson. he picked a premise from the extremely finite bucket of blockbuster formulas and made a film to sell tickets, push the technology, break box office records, entertain the brain stem and afterward bombard us with avatar merchandise.but doesn't that make him one of the bad guys?",neutral
176,"What to say? What to say about this movie ? Its very difficult for me to explain how good the movie was. Excellent Movie. Excellent Direction. Superb CGI Effects. Very good acting especially from Stephen Lang as Col. Miles Quaritch. This movie will be a sure Oscar winner.As the movie goes - In AD 2154, a human corporation mines Pandora, the lush, low gravity moon of Polyphemus, one of three gas giants that orbit Alpha Centauri A, 4.4 light-years (280,000 AU) from Earth. The humans seek to exploit Pandora's reserves of a precious mineral called unobtanium. Parker Selfridge , the head of the mining operation, employs former marines and soldiers as mercenaries.Pandora is inhabited by an indigenous paleolithic species of sapient humanoids called the Na'vi. Humans are unable to breathe Pandora's atmosphere, which is rich in carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia, and peaceful interaction with the Na'vi is difficult. Human researchers led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) create the Avatar Program, genetically engineering human-Na'vi hybrids. A human who shares genetic material with an avatar is mentally linked to it, allowing them to control it while their own body 'sleeps'. These avatars cost millions to produce and link, so gaining access to one is difficult. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a former Marine who was paralyzed below the waist in combat on Earth. His twin brother, Thomas, was a scientist working in the Avatar Program; when Thomas is killed, Jake takes his brother's place because he is genetically compatible with his brother's avatar. Dr. Augustine is less than happy about Jake being there, as he has no knowledge of Na'vi culture and has never used an avatar. (In contrast, his brother had a doctorate and years of training to participate in the program.) Jake's first assignment is to escort Dr. Augustine and a biologist named Norm Spellman through the hostile jungle. The group is attacked by a thanator, a large predator, and Jake becomes separated from the others, forcing them to leave him behind for the night. Jake attempts to survive in his avatar body, fending off dangerous creatures. This attracts the attention of a female Na'vi named Neytiri who rescues Jake. Although, at first, she is troubled by Jake's recklessness, when some floating seeds are attracted to him she sees it as a spiritual sign from Eywa . She takes him to the Na'vi Hometree, the spiritual and geographical home of her clan. The Na'vi decide to teach Jake about their culture.Jake is ordered by Colonel Miles Quaritch on a diplomatic mission to obtain the trust of the Na'vi clan and is given three months to convince them to abandon their Hometree, which sits above a large deposit of unobtanium. As Jake learns the way of the Na'vi, he gradually finds himself caught between the military-industrial forces of Earth and a newfound love for his adopted home and people. AJake is successfully initiated into the tribe after passing the Omaticaya rites of passage to become a Man. Neytiri and Jake choose each other as mates, much to the jealousy of Tsu'Tey , heir to the chieftainship of the tribe who was originally chosen as Neytiri's mate. Jake keeps silent on the human's plans to use force if the Na'vi will not leave peacefully, but when the deadline runs out, a bulldozing machine comes to begin destruction and almost kills Jake and Neytiri. He saves them both by destroying the camera and sensors on the machine.Jake pleads for another chance to convince them to leave and is given one hour by Selfridge. When he reveals his mission to the Na'vi, they feel betrayed by him and they leave him for dead when the hour runs out. Jake stirs the Na'vi to war with the assistance of Neytiri and Tsu'Tey, now the newly appointed chief of the clan. Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other tribes to battle the human forces. Colonel Quaritch, seeing that the Na'vi are growing in numbers, orders a preemptive attack to destroy the Tree of Souls, the center of Na'vi religion and culture.As the battle begins, the Na'vi put up a formidable defense under Jake's leadership, but take heavy casualties, including Tsu'Tey, Trudy, and Norm's avatar. When all hope seems lost, the Pandoran wildlife suddenly launch a mass attack, overwhelming the humans. Neytiri interprets this as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Colonel Quaritch orders the Tree of Souls bombed, but Jake destroys the bombing shuttle before the explosive is launched.Quaritch's gunship is destroyed, but he manages to escape in his AMP (Amplified Mobility Platform) suit. As he proceeds to the Tree of Souls in order to destroy it, he finds the Avatar interface field pod Jake's compatriots had moved and decides to assault it to kill the human Jake. Neytiri, who was riding on a Thanator and Jake's avatar arrive to defeat him, but not before the pod sustains serious damage, exposing Jake to Pandora's toxic atmosphere. Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake, seeing his human form for the first time. Then they fall in love for each other.Defeated, the humans are forced to leave Pandora, while Jake and his friends are allowed to remain. As the humans leave, Jake is seen wearing the insignia of the Omaticaya clan leader. The film ends with Jake's soul being transplanted from his human body to his Na'vi avatar at the Tree of Souls; his breathing mask is removed from his human body, indicating that the transplant is permanent Jake now starts his new life as a Na'vi.So, Hats of to James Cameron - You are great. I am waiting for its SEQUEL.Everybody should watch this. The film is directed by a master director",positive
177,"James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by ""aliens"" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw.",neutral
178,"This movie has no equal.. Incredible effects, totally mind blowing environment. I just did not want the movie to end.I read some comments saying it has so and so, and that is why they give 8 or 7 for rating. Movies are to entertain and this movie is by far the BEST entertainment i got. Dear James Cameron, why did you make the movie so short?? Even if it was almost three hours it was not enough for me. I need Avatar 2. Start making it please !!!!!!!!!!! And make it a little longer ........Hey you people who are reading this, why are you waiting for ?? Go to a 3D theater and watch this. You will not regret it.",positive
179,"For the first time in my life as a writer, I won't be writing a lengthy paragraph.When I saw the movie, I cried for two reasons. One, because I am also an artist, and the sheer beauty of its digital imagery stunned me to tears. Second, with a lesson in environmental concern, the simple story of a lost tribe and their survival moved me so much. I fell in love with such imaginary, admirable characters (both human and Navi). I fell for a sci-fi story with a heart.So allow me this reluctance to elaborate further. You just have to see it to believe it. Believe that you are in Pandora even for two fleeting hours, and it will be more than worth the trip.Thank you, James Cameron. Once again, you are king of the world.",positive
180,"Terminator, Titanic, these are the names everyone have heard of. What do they have in common with Avatar? An avangard director by the name of James Cameron. This was my first IMAX 3D experience and this turned out to be a visual extravaganza. In recent past, Hollywood has produced some stunning movies in the genre, and we knew something great is coming, and this movie shows how far we have come; this is what we had been waiting for. This is the benchmark of the 21st century action-adventure-sci-fi experience. The movie is about Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic marine, who travels 4.4 light years to come to Pandora, under the banner of Avatar program. Pandora a lush green, low gravity moon of Polyphemus, inhabited by hominoid race called Na'vi. A Na'vi is nine feet tall, have bones reinforced by naturally occurring carbon fibre, have bioluminescent blue skin, big eyes, small ears and a tail. They live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess called Eywa. Members of Avatar program have successfully genetically engineered human-na'vi hybrid knows ""Avatar"", that can be remotely controlled. Jake's mission is to infiltrate the Na'vi camp, gather Intel and reconcile a treaty with them to move their camp, which happen to be resting on large deposit of ""unobtanium"", the reason for humans to come to Pandora. Failing to convince the Na'vi's and simultaneously falling in love with them, their culture and a Na'vi name Neytiri (Zoë Saldaña). When Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), decides to go all weapons free on Na'vi population, Jake sides with Na'vi's to give them an edge in the ""battle of bows and arrows against gunships"". The visual effects in the movie are truly groundbreaking. The movie is interesting, entertaining, emotional, and action packed; an overall awesome performance. Animation, characterization of Na'vi and other Pandora creatures are by far the best I have seen. A must watch. Treat yourself by watching it in IMAX 3D.",positive
181,I watch movies for a living and feel as though most movies are just rehashes of movies that have already been made. Avatar is different. Cameron has created a new world that I felt I became a part of while watching. The detail is absolutely amazing. All I could think about when watching this movie is how the Native Americans must have felt when the white man came to town. The idea that everything is connected touched home with me. The natives felt such a connection with every thing on their planet. It was so original to have the natives literally connect with the other species on the planet. I must admit that parts of it were predictable but it was so worth the ride.,positive
182,"Avatar is the best really big blockbuster since LOTR: The Return of the King, also smashing that movie at the box office. It's an amazing film as long as you don't take it too seriously and consider the quality and originality of the story. Cameron has tried to make an epic that also delivers a message to the audience. One problem is that the story is so weak and unoriginal. Also the message is so easily discernible, it could just as well be written in plain text at the start of the film... Thus it loses much power.Avatar works much better for you if you turn your brain off. Then you can let yourself be amazed by the incredible visuals, both people and landscapes look stunningly good and lifelike. I can promise with all my heart that you've never seen anything like it! And please watch it in 3D! This movie is made for 3D, and it really shows how 3D can make a movie into an experience you'll remember for a long time.",neutral
183,"I've seen this movie twice now; both times in 3D.The visuals are spectacular without a doubt. James Cameron has always been on the leading edge of breaking new ground in special effects. You are really immersed in the world of Pandora.The plot though leaves something to be desired. Basically, you have the hero with a tragic past who goes on a mission for the bad guys. He meets up with the locals and realizes that he was working for the bad guys and changes sides and all the clichéd characters are there from the evil gung-ho Marine colonel to the jealous but noble native warrior.If you've seen Dances with Wolves or Last Samurai, or The Mission or any of a dozen of movies with a plot line like that, then you've seen this and you know exactly what is going to happen.Then we come to the plot holes.1. It took the ship 5 years to get to Pandora. Sully's brother had trained for 3 years prior to this for the ""mission."" So they had a mission almost 10 years in the making? The situation on the ground in Pandora wouldn't have changed in that 10 years? Really? I mean it looked like the operation on Pandora was relatively new...I'm pretty sure the evil corporation would have gone ahead and knocked down the tree long before Sully got to the planet. 8 years is a long time.2. Unobtainium....really? That was the best James Cameron could come up with? So it's a rare material but what does it do? Surely, Cameron could have come up with something better than that.3. If arrows couldn't penetrate the cockpit windshields in the scene where they destroy the hometree, then how could they do so in the final battle? 4. Speaking of the military equipment...wow, pretty flimsy. The heavy machineguns are obviously just M-60's with a few pieces of metal (or rubber) slapped on the sides. But the transports were pretty vulnerable to...just about everything. In 150 years, that's the best we've come up with? The mech-warrior things were cool but again...pretty vulnerable. I have to wonder if this was the part of the movie that James Cameron came up with 15 years ago and just didn't notice that the trend is unmanned.5. If the vortex cause all sorts of complications with the instruments in the transports...why were communications unaffected and why wasn't the Avatar program disrupted in there as well? 6. So the master plan to defeat the Navi was to fly a slow-moving transport aircraft as a makeshift bomber to bomb the tree? They couldn't bomb the place from orbit? And before someone jumps on me for the gravitational flux or whatever...no. They were able to get orbital imagery so they could have easily just fired some cruise missiles or whatever the future evil corporation has and carpet bombed that whole region. The first rule of combat is to kill your enemy from as far away as possible and a former (or current) Marine Recon Lt Col would know that.8. As for the end battle...what was the ground assault for? The main effort was to bomb the tree into oblivion, right? So...why send in your ground troops who were already outnumbered? Why not just send in your fast attack ships to just fire incendiary rockets at the tree and call it a day? 7. The Avatar Navi bodies were genetically engineered to reach full maturity in a short amount of time...you gotta think that such engineering would also cause a short lifespan for such a creature. After all, Sully and his brother before him were supposed to be on a 6 year mission so why create something to last longer? Not a big point but it'd be interesting to see in Avatar 2 that Jake Sully's avatar begins a rapid decline in health, haha.8. So the evil corporation just left before they got punched in the nose? Yeah, they wouldn't just come back with more firepower or anything and just blast like a 1,000 square kilometer area into smoldering ruin from where they would build a new base.I suppose the message Cameron is sending is ""hey, don't pay attention to the flimsy plot line, look how beautiful this world is that I created!"" The other messages were just lame. Hey James Cameron, Bush isn't in office any more and hopefully you weren't saying that Saddam Hussein was like the Navi...because yeah, you can bet that Hussein would have been 10 times as worse as the evil mercenaries were.And the irony of this film which cost upwards of 400 million to make and took the cutting edge of technology and probably had quite a carbon footprint...yet technology is evil and we should all go back to nature where there will be complete harmony......yeah.....",neutral
184,"This blockbuster directed by James Cameron twelve years after ""Titanic"" is a perfect mixture of previous Cameron movies. Although it includes many classical factors of James Cameron movies which will seem familiar for you it still worth to be named the best motion picture of the 21 century so far. It discusses many issues we face today in our planet, contains several original thoughts in science fiction and tells an old story in a very fresh way.THE WAR It talked about human invasion in a new planet called Pandora in the future for some vital resources and the residents called Na'Vis have to fight with human for their own civilization. The conflict begins with this simple reason and deepens as some crazy people in army who holds strong violence in mind always find a solution of ""fighting terror with terror"". And this triggers another inside conflict in the human side when a group of researchers who studies behaviors of Na'Vis using Avatars found that this invasion will destroy this upper civilization. Is this a mirror of some of the issues we face globally? ENVIRONMENT AND TECHNOLOGY We people are animals that are good at and are keen about transforming our nature. We are trying to learn the world by creating technologies and then use those technologies to convert the nature to what we want it to be but NOT what it should be. This is our civilization. Unlike ours, the civilization of the Na'Vis is more complied with their environment and eventually they have an upper level of evolution. Do we need to be more complied with the environment in our planet earth today? THE LOVE This movie tells us a good and powerful love story. The brain and intellect connection of male and female will cross some boundaries which anyone will not neglect. Love is the source of the power.GET BACK TO THE CINEMAThe IMXA 3D, WOW, you should really try this. You will find it is pretty flat when you go to the 2D cinema after the 3D experience. If you watched most of James Cameron's movies before including ""The Abyss"", you will notice that this is a story after ""The Abyss"". It is a deeper abyss on Pandora.",positive
185,"I have just returned from seeing Avatar in 3D and although it is visually pleasing, it gives you an empty feeling. I am a big fan of James Cameron's work and as he has been working on this movie for many years, I was expecting something fantastic. If you consider the length of the movie, I would have thought that, by the end, we would care whether the main characters live or die. I did not.The visuals are state of the art and for the first hour, its an enjoyable watch. Once you get used to what you are seeing, you need some kind of story to keep you interested. There is no real story here that we have not seen before and those previous stories were told much better. For the quality and depth of the story, think Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.You have to feel slightly sorry for the actors as I think it would be a difficult task to imagine the end product of this film.It should probably be the Oscar for Visual Effects and possibly Best Editing but definitely nothing else. Its a sad fact that, these days, films sell just on Visual Effects but we do need some quality story lines Mr Cameron.",neutral
186,"Well, I'm going to have to give this movie a full rating because it really lived up to my expectations.We have here a science-fiction epic set on an alien world. It's a classic story of a ""good-guy"" hero who must overcome a battle within himself to do what is right.Although the movie doesn't exactly have the biggest twists, turns, or surprises, it simply sets out to do what movies like ""Star Wars"" (the ones in the 70s, and 80s, that is) did... to stun us a little with the latest in special FX, give us a classic ""Romanesque"" story, and enchant us with a very creative world. This movie did what it set out to do, perfectly... and maybe even a little better than perfect.The world is so detailed, and rich. Every animal looks as if it is real... and everything just matches and seems convincing. The ""humanoid"" race that inhabits this world is very interesting, and the way the world works ""together"" is amazing. This may be one of the few sci-fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in favor of the storyline. Animals and beings do not look like animations. This realism, this pushing of the limits, is what science fiction is all about.But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no storyline or character to back it up. There is a lot of character in this movie. All of our human characters, the alien race, and the avatars all equally have great character. And the storyline, although nothing extraordinarily original, is chiseled from ""classic"" storytelling. Good versus evil... doing what is right... all spun neatly together.What a wonderful escape this was! It was dazzling, and even got me thinking a little about what life is really out there on the various billions of stars that make up our galaxy, and the other billions of galaxies out there.And that's what movies like this should do.",positive
187,"Not blessed with two good eyes I can't see in 3D. I suspect that many of the glowing reviews this movie is generating would be more subdued if the 3D candy was missing. Sure, it still looked great in 2D but the weaknesses of the story were more revealing. The basic plot has been done before and done better(Dances with Wolves). The bad guy was completely one-dimensional. For me, a James Cameron fan, this was his least satisfying effort since The Abyss. It felt like I was watching something he scripted shortly after making Piranha 2. Dialogue has never been one of Cameron's strong points and he isn't going to generate an Oscar nomination for screenplay with lines like ""It's not over as long as I'm still breathing!""",neutral
188,"Avatar (2009) is a visually stunning film that showcases some of the most impressive CGI work to date. The lush and vibrant world of Pandora is a joy to behold, and the design of the Na'vi and the other creatures that inhabit the planet is truly breathtaking.However, despite its impressive visual style, Avatar suffers from a lack of substance in its story and characters. The plot is fairly predictable and unoriginal, and none of the characters are particularly interesting or complex.Additionally, the film falls into the trap of the savior complex, with the Na'vi needing the help of the human protagonist to fight back against their oppressors. While the film's themes of environmentalism and cultural respect are admirable, they are not explored in a particularly nuanced or deep way.Overall, while Avatar is a feast for the eyes, it falls short in terms of narrative and character development. If you're looking for a film that prioritizes style over substance, then Avatar may be worth checking out. However, if you're looking for a more engaging and well-developed story, you may want to look elsewhere.",neutral
189,"Avatar is quite simply the most outstanding movie experience that I have witnessed to date. It excels on all levels without exception. Anyone who is fan of science fiction / fantasy and enjoys having their imagination tickled will thrive on the vast wealth of original creativity contained within this multi-layered epic masterpiece. Avatar is a movie you don't watch... you live it.VISUAL PRESENTATION: James Cameron has thrown down the gauntlet with Avatar's stunning visual imagery, phenomenal CGI and 3D presentation. The next generation motion capture technology that James Cameron developed and utilised in the production of this movie has achieved a wholly realistic quality. The days of dead-eyes, emotionless facial expressions and general unnatural creepiness (such as seen in Robert Zemekis' Polar Express) are at an end. CG characters are for the first time truly emotionally expressive to the extent that they appear real. The overall quality of the CGI is so high that for the first time it is practically impossible to distinguish between what's real and CGI. Cameron's perfectionism has paid off particularly in this regard.3D OR NOT 3D? Avatar is a great movie irrespective of whether you watch it in 2D or 3D. However, if you want the best viewing experience I strongly recommend you watch the 3D version. Opting to view the 2D version would be akin to choosing to watch Titanic on a black and white television... why would you do that? I watched the 3D version (in RealD not Dolby3D) and can comment that it was a mind-boggling spectacular experience. I have never, ever found myself so immersed within a movie... The 3D is not in any way the occasional gimmicky hey-look-I'm-jumping-out-the-screen-at-you effect of the past. Everything has a truly three dimensional depth... the effect is that of astonishing realism... It is literally as if you are actually there in Pandora watching events as they occur. With Avatar any apprehension I had about the new 3D technology has been quashed, it is without a doubt the way forward for visual entertainment and I very much hope other movies take note of Avatar's demonstration of how it should be done.AUDIO: The music composed by James Horner is consistent with his previous work and superbly lends itself to immersing you in the world of Pandora rather than beating you over the head with a relentlessly pounding soundtrack. Horner provides the perfect balance of atmospheric ambiance where relevant blended with thrill-inspiring pulse-pounding accompaniment to the various action sequences. The quality of the sound effects and mixing is also exceptional. Whilst the music was pleasingly emotive there were also times I was literally shaking in my seat.STORY: The one area that Avatar has received criticism from some is regarding its story. I'm not going to include any spoilers here, but suffice to say that the theme of the story is strongly science fiction / fantasy so if you don't like that sort of thing then this movie may not particularly enthral you. On the other hand if you enjoy sci-fi and possess even a modicum of intelligence you will almost certainly enjoy the story as much as I did. Please don't pay attention to any of the tabloid film critics who in my opinion always try to be too clever for their own boots. Any talk of Avatar's story lacking originality is quite frankly utter nonsense. Of course, there are certain aspects that could be considered similar to this movie or that movie, but commenting that Avatar is low in originality is akin to stating that The Terminator is not original because it comprises what is essentially the standard formula for an action film, namely lead/hero meets villain, lead/hero battles villain through various action sequences, lead/hero kills villain, the end. Of course The Terminator was most original, and so is Avatar. In fact, the extent of imaginative creativity contained within Avatar's story, in particular relating to Pandora and its inhabitants, is mind-numbing. Furthermore, Cameron pulls off a high level of character depth to not only the lead characters but even those of a supporting role. The wealth of imaginative ideas contained within Avatar is more than enough to produce at least one if not two sequels. Let's just hope that we don't have to wait so long for the next instalment. I for one am longing to return to Pandora!",positive
190,"First of all I would like to place upon my sincere thanks towards Mr James Cameroon for taking his valuable five years of his life for making a movie no one except him could have ever imagined.. Being under pressure of humongous amount of money stake he carried the expectations with ease and expertise.. This is not just a movie.. Its a rich experience which may eventually blow of your mind.. All in a future high-tech metaphora, of enormous weaponry and spaceships and a primitive jungle world that's both weird but also so familiar...Hats off to James for his thinking and imagination..(He even created a language for the creatures living on the James-made-Planet).. For performance I would love to take two names: Sam Worthington and Michelle Rodriguez.. Both were superb in their roles.. Sam's simplicity initially will take you as a surprise and watch out for his performance during the fight sequence as a Na'vi.. He will surely walk away with loads of accolades.. Cinematography is pragmatic and enigmatic.. VFX and Graphics used are marvelous.. James' Direction is humongous superb and breath taking.. After allowing the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich to try and direct large action films he returns to show them how a master does it..My advice: ""Take out 3 hrs of time out of your lives(even if you are not a movie buff) to enjoy an experience nobody ever imagined.. Just buy a tub of popcorn and a soft drink and enjoy""My Rating: 9.5/10Thanks & Regards",positive
191,"James Cameron's sci-fi epic finally arrives having gestated in the filmmakers mind for longer than a decade. Is his vision of the future just as fresh in 2009 or is should this avatar be terminated? There's one thing you have to give Cameron, he is like the postman...he delivers; granted sometimes he may be a little late but if there 's one filmmaker you can always rely on its Cameron. I haven't disliked a Cameron movie to date, in fact I've loved, almost, everything he's done; with the exception of course being Piranha II but let's not get into that. Avatar is a razor-sharp reminder of how epic film-making is done. Not since Return of The King has epic been done on a scale this big.A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3-D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron. The story ticks all the right boxes, at least for a Cameron film. It's got good guys with guns, bad guys with even bigger guns and appalling guys with even bigger guns. It's far from original and won't come up at this week's book club. This said it's very engaging and the people, and aliens, involved are interesting. The film goes to great length in order to develop its characters so we feel the hardship and pain when they fall in battle. The film does an excellent job of keeping a good pace. Its near impossible to get bored whilst watching the film and this may have been the quietest i have ever seen an audience. It's an engaging trek through uncharted lands that, while feeling very familiar, is a brand new assault on the senses.James Cameron has spent a long time in incubation, flitting around on submarines, but if ""Avatar is a reminder of anything it's a reminder that he's the best the industries got. His harsh, no-nonsense approach to film-making has landed him with one of the most polished pieces of art of the century and for that I take my hat off to you. This may be the most polished movie of the decade, sweeping, epic and ... dare I say flawless? Not quite. As far as the direction goes however, it's close enough and ranks, for me, as Cameron's second best film to date, behind ""Aliens"". IN the hands of any other director this could have gone terribly wrong; anybody other than Cameron may have played it safe delivering a spectacle, but an underwhelming one. Cameron pushes so many boundaries with one single film that it's hard not to stand up and cheer once the final credits roll. This film has pushed the limitation of the cinema medium and emerged as one of the finest film of the decade. And dare I say a classic? The acting is exceptional. Nothing warms my heart more than seeing Weaver and Cameron united for the first time since she stood toe to toe with the alien queen. She is astounding and gives an electrifying performance as Dr. Grace Augustine a woman split between two worlds. What's funny is the fact that she is not the strongest actor in the film. If anybody deserves a standing ovation is has to be Zoe Saldana who completely transforms into this other worldly thing. If you had gone into the movie not knowing that that was her you would never had guessed she was even human. She is unrecognisable and exhilarating as Neytiri who is, without a doubt, the standout role of the film. Other congratulations must be given to Sam Worthington who shows us that Terminator Salvation was not just beginners luck. Michelle Rodriguez gives a stellar turn as Trudy Chacon and ends up the way Rodriguez usually ends up. That however would be too much information.Now for the pièce de résistance the reason you've already booked your ticket, the reason you're so sceptical, the reason the hype for this film is so large. The presentation. To call it out of this world would be an understatement. It's stunning. Sun all those pre conceived judgement and see for yourself. The sheer scope of the film is impeccable. This film will have you clambering through the jungle on horseback, soaring on the back of a banshee and just when you've taken in the sights and sounds Pandora has to offer you've bee blinded be the beautiful destruction on the final act. Any filmmaker that can make such destruction rather beautiful is a mastermind in my opinion.Verdict: Avatar is far more than a movie, it's a cinematic experience. This is a visually assault on the senses and something that is destined to change cinema forever. It's utterly gorgeous; all backed up with scene stealing acting, fantastic direction and, wait for it, the mother of all battle scenes. Believe the hype; Cameron has delivered one of the best films of the decade and something that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. I'll be waiting in anticipation for the sequel; just don't be too long will you?",positive
192,"First, he gave us slimy “Aliens” that Sigourney Weaver battled hard as Ripley. Then the cult hit “Terminator” that created a new benchmark for science fiction and followed it up with the smash hit sequel “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” which initiated many in my generation to Sci-Fi and admiration of Hollywood. “Titanic” mesmerized fans of both SFX and Romance genres while it pushed the envelope for elaborate production design.More than 12 years after “Titanic” comes the most awaited movie of the recent years “Avatar” in which James Cameron has created a whole new Planet Pandora replete with new creatures, predators and humanoid aliens that in every way are beautiful! Well, it did cost him more than 300 million USD to make it and another 100 spent on promotion, but the spectacle that you see on the gigantic IMAX screen in 3D is beyond words!! Set in 2154 and 4 light years away, humans are now exploiting ‘Pandora’ an earth-like moon orbiting a gas giant in Alpha Centauri for an expensive and rare mineral appropriately called ‘unobtanium’. Coming in their way are the indigenous Na’vi who need to be relocated from their ‘home-tree’ that sits on a deposit of unobtainium.RDA, the company has already tried its best to convince the Na’vi to move. They have taught them English and tried offering infrastructure. But, being content in their natural settings, the Na’vi have no interest in what the humans have to offer. English plus business: doesn’t this remind you of European colonization in some sort? The air on Pandora is toxic to humans necessitating the wearing of gas masks outdoors. To get around this, the researchers led by Dr Grace Augustine played by good old Sigourney Weaver have developed an alien-human hybrid ‘Avatar’ that can be mentally controlled by the brain of the person whose DNA was used to build it. Here, the idea of jacking into a computer generated digital-self will surely remind you of “The Matrix”!The death of his researcher brother in the Avatar program leads to his paraplegic ex-Marine brother Jake Sully joining up the Avatar program. Played by Sam Worthington of Terminator Salvation fame, Jake is happy using his Avatar that gets him to use his legs. Soon, he befriends the tree living Na’vi and its huntress princess Neytiri. Learning their ways during the day, Jake returns to debrief his trigger-happy boss, Colonel Quaritch.Soon Jake begins to appreciate the harmony and spiritual connection the Na’vi have with nature and falls in love with Neytiri, much to the dismay of Quaritch who attacks the home-tree. Though the script was written a decade ago, I believe Cameron has subtly hit out at the recent American battles for oil that the administration justified in dubious ways. For those who say the script is poor, take this quote from Jake Sully “When people are sitting on stuff you want, you make them your enemy”. Thought provoking indeed! Visual effects are Avatar’s forte as it creates a new world before you. Filmed in blank sets with motion capture, the actors had to act out without ever knowing what it would look like on screen. Sensors on the Actors’ body and spots on their faces picked up moves and emotions bringing the CGI characters to life. To bring his actors up to speed, Cameron took them to jungles in Hawaii to bring them up to speed on jungle life. 60% of Avatar is CGI with only 40% being real footage. What you’re left with is a WOW! While you may not see Zoe Saldana as Neytiri anywhere in its 162 minutes, the nimble ballet trained actor worked hard to make her character so endearing and realistic. The scenes where she trains Jake in the art of war are its best, be it bonding with the Ikran that seems like a flyer straight from ‘Jurassic Park’ or riding Pa’li the hairless horse.The biggest blame that Avatar can take is that its story is too predictable. Man recruited to fight, falls for the local culture and turns his guns around; just as you saw in “The Last Samurai”. But, making Avatar cool are its special effects that seem so real in IMAX 3D.Emotion seekers and script blamers can’t really deny the story’s soft side when you see the Na’vi suffer human attack and they die fighting for nature we have scant respect for. For one, Na’vi lived for everything we don’t. Politically too, the battle takes a dig on the suffering the Native Red Indians went through in the country that Hollywood comes from.On Music, James Horner’s score doesn’t really stand out and has his ‘Troy’-esque feel. Probably, a score that doesn’t stick out as a sore thumb is good enough in a movie that’s all about special effects. As for Cameron and Horner, this is their third venture together after ‘Aliens’ and ‘Titanic’ with the latter giving him his first and only Oscar honors.As a director, James Cameron doesn’t need a critic’s recommendation. He dropped out of college and drove trucks, but Cameron is the super benchmark movie maker with truly gifted imagination and commitment to translate his dreams to the screen. You simply can’t ask for more from a sci-fi movie at least for a few more years to come! The least I can do with my review is to give it a 10/10. What are you waiting for? Go pull out your newspapers or log on to the web, check show times for 3D and book your tickets now! An IMAX would be even better. Believe me, it’s a bang for your buck!",positive
193,"James Cameron is capable of making films that are both visually stunning and emotionally convincing; ""Avatar"" is no exception. However, this film is different from many of his other films simply due to its large scale and influence. The film demonstrates one of the best world-building in films to this day. Every aspect of Pandora feels imaginative, exciting, and realistic. Amusing sights like floating mountains and small details such as the Na'vi language are all what make the world so elaborate and realistic. By working with experts of different fields, Cameron has created a breathing planet. And of course, the use of 3D adds to the immersive experience.The characters are also an interesting aspect. Even thought the third act is more action centered, the emotions are still there. The audience can feel the devastation the Na'vi feel during throughout the film. And its comments on colonialism is also remarkable. The characters are developed well and the ending is very emotional yet hopeful. This is truly one of the most influential modern movies.",neutral
194,"I went into this movie not knowing what to think. A lot of people I knew told me how good it was but I also heard many say that it did not live up to the hype. After watching this movie I have to say I'm not disappointed but I don't think it deserves all the praise it is getting. Some of my complaints are how weak the story is, to me it seems the James Cameron just copied the ideas of all the big sci-fi movies of the past 10 years and combined them together. Also the story was very predictable, I knew what was going to happen almost from the very beginning and nothing surprised me. While their were some good things about it like the visuals and special effects that does not make a movie and the visual did not make the movie any better. But like I said it was not a complete disappointment. It did have some good action sequences and some decent dialogue even though most of the rest of the dialogue was crap. So overall it was just an average action movie and I don't see how this could be nominated for awards over so much better sci-fi movies out this year like District 9, Moon, and Star Trek. Which I think are all better movies then this and would pick any one of their directors to be nominated for a directors guild award over James Cameron",neutral
195,"Avatar makes the best out of CGI in this live-action, emotional, putting you on the edge of your seat film of extraordinary proportions.Just like James Cameron has done in the past he has brought something new to cinema. He has directed some of the most influential and amazing films of the last twenty years some examples being The Terminator and Titanic. Avatar has now come to take it's place in such high rankings.Watching Avatar is like being on a roller-coaster ride that you just do not want to get off of. When you see it you'll know what I'm talking about. With all of the action, sorrow, romance, and the fight to just be there is absolutely no way that you can't enjoy this movie.Avatar tells the story about a man named Jake that lost his legs while on duty in the military. Now he travels to the world Pandora on a mission that could help him get his legs back. He is on a mining world where what they are digging up is worth a lot of money. However, the natives of Pandora are called the Na'vi and their home is on the site of where they're trying to mine and that is where Jake comes in. His mission was to get them to relocate but in time that starts to change. He uses an avatar (a body that looks like him and Na'vi as well) he uses this body to communicate with the Navi. While he is under their care he falls for the princess of the Na'vi. As he feels more at home with them the sooner he realizes that he must make a choice to side with the humans or the Na'vi and find his true place in life.Avatar is probably the most amazing film of not just the year but the decade. This is a film that you would love to see over and over again.",positive
196,"Visually amazing. Spectacular. Awesome. Fantastic. By far one of the best looking films I have seen in ages.Plot/Story/Acting/Theme - absolutely atrocious. Bloody awful.The plot is an awful mix of The Smurfs, Pocahontas and Fern Gully. It really should be called 'Smurfahontas Gully' instead of 'Avatar'. I have also heard it described as a film about 'Magical Negroes'(for brief summary or the 'Magical Negroes' argument, see BBC article 'Is blue the new black?').It was just the same with Titanic. Visually amazing and outstanding at the time but the plot and character lacked substantially and were often cringe-worthy.I would recommend seeing it for the visual effects but little else.",positive
197,"I'll make this short and sweet... (Though if I could, I would write a BOOK about how much I loved this movie! I am too sick to do so, so it will have to do with a short review!) I was so incredibly TOUCHED by this movie! It was SO beautiful on so many levels, so realistic, so incredibly huge, over the top, and utterly mind-blowing in all aspects!! I saw the 3D version and just sat there in awe, even all through the ending credits... I could NOT close my mouth! My jaw was all the way down there, right there, on the floor of the movie theater.Dear James Cameron: I want to LIVE on Pandora. To me, it was, and still is, very much real! The characters were so real and GOOD that I like them better than most people I've met! Sigh... Two lives.. What an idea.. I wish I could wake up as a Na'vi one day! Avatar made me cry several times though the movie. I am a 31 year old male, FYI. The first that I cried when watching Avatar was when I realized how beautiful Pandora was. Then again when I understood how good, innocent and pure the Na'vi were. Neytiri is probably the most beautiful personality I've ever seen anywhere, in movies and in real life, and I absolutely fell in love with her soul. I cried when I saw Neytiri and Jake Sully kiss. It was such a beautiful moment. Then I cried when I just understood how amazing this movie really is - The whole meaning of it. It was just... Too much!!! There was just so much LOVE in this movie! Mr. Cameron, you're a Genius! Best movie of the year, and probably the best movie I ever saw. . .Thomas in Norway",positive
198,"A couple of years ago I found myself wondering what had ever happened to that once great director James Cameron? You know the one; he produced a string of hits, Titanic, T2, True Lies, Aliens. He had managed to circumvent the artistic divide somewhere between critical acclaim and box office success. Whatever happened to him?Basically, Avatar happened. It was an acorn of an idea that; like anything worth investing time in, has taken many many years to bring from infancy to adulthood. A real labour of love that has made a lot of recent waves in the media for setting new records for budget requirement and length of post production. All of this coupled with the kudos that goes with a James Cameron project, mean that the goalposts for success both critically and financially, were going to be set pretty high....As a film Avatar works fairly well, it sets it's building blocks on very firmly established sci-fi ideals and ensures at all times that no matter how imaginative the storytelling; the realm of reality that has been crafted is consistent and believable.There are a lot of nuances that would have you believe Avatar has scrounged strong plot moves and ideals from several other films and on the whole this has to be accepted. Avatar cannot be considered a wholly original or innovative sci-fi movie. In my mind I can set aside some of this 'borrowing' by clinging on to the fact that the first draft was apparently written a long time before some of its predecessors were ever conceived. This however does not excuse any of the stylistic elements which make Avatar look very much like an homage to The Matrix, The Phantom Menace and the Halo franchise.There is an amalgamated feel to Avatar which is all its own and if you can forget that you are seeing a fairly straight forward, unidirectional story unfold before your eyes; then I think there really is something in there for everyone. From pretty much the first scene it was fairly obvious what was going to happen to Jake Sully and how the character would develop within the realms of the story. However the was still enough drama, action, romance and political overture to keep me enthralled for the majority of the movie.there is a 30 minute segment in the middle of the picture which judged against the rest, could be considered a little dull. However even this section could never be considered lifeless or without heart, nor would make anyone turn the movie off or leave their seats. In truth this part of the narrative is almost unavoidable and within the realms of the characters provided is absolutely inevitable. There is a certain school of thought, that would lead me to believe this part of the story is deliberately slow burning to allow the magnanimous crescendo at the finale to be accentuated, however I have to temper that opinion by saying that it still won't be to everyone's liking.There is a message in Avatar that is obvious and makes no excuses for its self and to a large extent; no excuse is needed. The overtures it makes have been made for as long as mankind has been in existence and there are very few people in the world who would be blind the problems it attempts to highlight.The acting throughout the film is universally excellent. It is now obvious why Sam Worthington is such high demand after only a very short carrier thus far. Sigourney Weaver reignites her relationship with James Cameron demonstrating the vigour that came before. She acts as a good foil for Worthington throughout. The undoubted star of the show however, isn't actually an actor or actress but the CGI created 'Nytiri' voiced excellently by the increasingly impressive (and busy) Zoe Saldana. The effects department have obviously taken extreme care to ensure the complex delicacy of the character is obviously but subtly presented on screen (it's a real triumph).Whilst the story isn't pulling up any trees (sorry that's a pun) or filled to the brim with new ideas, the CGI team have mastered the images presented absolutely faultlessly. It really could be considered an evolutionary step forward in digital media and green screening. Through 120+ minutes of entertainment their expertise can never be questioned.So whilst there are overly corny moments that will have some audiences rolling their eyes and there are periods of sentiment and political overture that are laid on a little thick; these slight errors in judgement can be forgiven because the overall attainment level of the film far outweighs the slight glitches.A masterpiece of storytelling? No. But a memorable, enjoyable, inoffensive and likable motion picture? Yes, most certainly.",positive
199,"I did not like Avatar. There, I said it. Criticize me, but this movie was bad. Just bad.One of the most predictable stories I've ever seen. Curiosity: I saw this movie with my best friend and usually before the movie starts we discuss how the movie is going to go and how the story will develop. We do that before every movie and many times we get the ending right (maybe not 100% right, but the most important things), but avatar was the first movie where we got everything right. EVERYTHING. We talked for like 20 minutes and got everything right. It was like We went inside Cameron's mind or something, just kidding because even a 10 year old could've guessed 90% of the movie.OK. So the graphics were awesome. So what?! Is a movie all about graphics to you? A movie only needs to be visually awesome to have an 8.4 rating?? How low has the movie industry gone? If people stopped thinking about the graphics for 5 minutes and just thought about the supernatural amount of clichés and predictability present in this movie, maybe this movie would have a 6 or 7 rating, but no, most people are like a little kid looking at something shiny and new - the content doesn't matter as long as it's pretty.Just one thing, if you didn't see the movie and don't want to hear or be aware of spoilers follow these measures: 1-Don't watch the trailer(it'll give too much away) 2-Don't read the synopsis (it'll give too much away) 3-Don't even think, or you'll figure the whole thing. Believe me. It's that predictable.",negative
200,"I went with my two kids, one is 16 years old and my daughter 9 years old. Afterwards by the buss stop, we looked at each other, and in unison we knew and agreed, we had experienced something extraordinary at many different levels, an once in a lifetime moment. This is truly by far the movies of all movies. The only bad thing that I can say about this movie is I never wanted it to end, all from the jaw dropping scenery to the emotional computer graphics. I takes a hold of you as I never experienced it in the theaters before.I feel blessed and grateful, really honored by the makers of Avatar, for letting us share this beautiful adventure, it is truly a milestone in motion picture history !",positive
201,"I actually feel like I've just seen the most beautiful painting ever painted, allowed entry into it and that I've stayed there for 2 and a half hours. I feel like I became part of this world and now, at home, I kind of miss the scenery, the animals, the people and the nature of the planet.This movie is more groundbreaking than Jurassic Park, Star Wars and all the other historical movies that you've read about. Though the story and the plot is not very original, like a mixture of Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas and, well, The Matrix, it doesn't really matter. The movie is not about changing your perspective on anything, imprinting some morals or shaking your beliefs, it's just about entertainment.Thank you James Cameron. I actually am one of the few who didn't like Titanic, I thought it was too mushy and story-lacking... but this, man, this is something else. I won't be able to watch another movie for weeks because, why bother?",positive
202,I love it. I loved it in 2009 and and I still love it now in 2020. Watched it so many times that I lost count already. It's just amazing perspective of our shallow reality vs fantasy world with most beautiful views. I would like to be part of that magical world too. Nowadays when life is getting more and more crazy and trivial.... It's just nice to get into that imaginary world even for just two hours to feel how it would be to be back in harmony with the mother nature..... I love the idea. Can not wait for continuation. Best movie ever for me!,positive
203,"did this really get delayed a decade? Why? So they could make sure they stuck to the formula? So they could steal part of the ending from LotR? Hadn't they seen Dances with Wolves yet ? Weren't there sufficient characters in DwW to steal? Let us count the ways this script was pabulum1. usual sexist, racist Hollywood PC BS. Every white guy is evil except two. Jake, who really has to turn into a blue-guy to stop being evil & the other scientist/avatar, who was not evil but was basically incompetent at everything & really a non-event in the script. Otoh, there is a female &/or minority ""doing the right thing"" everywhere we look. How uplifting! I guess there must not be many theaters in China yet, since none of the ""good guys"" were Chinese. There's 6 billion or something people waiting to be pandered to. 2. about 1/3rd of the way thru, I said to myself ""I'll bet jake & the evil security guy will end the movie in hand-to-hand combat. I'm hoping he gets impaled on a hot steam pipe & the steam keeps coming out, like in some Governator movie."" ... Check! Though, I will give it a minor award for creativity b/c it wasn't actually jake versus the evil guy. It was Jake's mental avatar versus the evil guy's mechanical robot/avatar. Nice little touch. But killed by arrows? Cowboys & indians comes to the 2010s. 3. when the battle started turning against the ""good guys"", I said to myself ""I'll bet the trees will come save them, like in LotR."" Check minus! I was close. It wasn't the plant-life but the animal-life. Wow, so unique. I'll bet P. Jackson is blue with envy. 4. Lest we forget the really dumb suppositions, (I'm sure there is a better cinematic term but unlike most imdbers, I never flunked out of film school) how about when we see Jake having meetings with the evil white guy(s) during the day or taping his thoughts during the day. So, what is his avatar doing, napping? ""Hey, wake up blue dude. It's 2 in the afternoon."" Oh, maybe he did most of it at night? Right, the guy lived on 2 hrs sleep/day. And then there's the idea that the indigenous blueies, who are supposed to be the paragon of simple virtues, who innately understand good versus evil, real versus fake, etc. will open their arms and take as one of their own a freakin avatar, a dreamwalker. The blue chief-to-be, you know, one of the ones who came over from DwW, said it correctly early on ... ""he's a demon in a fake body."" that is exactly right. The blue paragons of virtue would have accepted him about as much as they would have accepted having a McDonalds built at the foot of their hometree. Crikey.Random thought ... Will G Ribisi win Best Facial Tics in 3 sec appearances Oscar?",neutral
204,"Yes this is 'Science Fiction', but the intended relationships with the elements of reality were so poor that they grated on my nerves throughout. Very clever CGI. Lovely colours. Sexy aliens. Characters absolutely unsympathetic. I couldn't develop any empathy at all with who they were or what they were doing. Any of them.The military staff were portrayed as the worst kind of gung-ho 'shoot-em- ups', full of prejudice against the natives of the land they have invaded so that they can steal the resources. The director couldn't have been less subtle in taking a swipe at Americans and America's foreign policies. Unintelligent. Was the film intended for an audience so self-centred and insulated from the world that the message needed to be force-fed at the expense of the final quality of the film?",neutral
205,"We've been waiting a long time for this to turn up on the big screen... well, here it is, AVATAR, the new blockbuster by James Cameron, having devoured some 300 million dollars... was it worth it?The Marine veteran Jack Sully, now handicapped, joins a research group on a moon called Pandora. These researchers employ so-called 'Avatars,' genetic reproductions of the Pandora natives, to win the natives' trust. These natives, the Navi, are physically superior beings, blue in color, and catlike in their motions; humans can connect with these clones and control them as if they were their own bodies. Reason for this whole endeavor is, of course, some rare resource that is beneath the natives' tribal home. Having learned to control his Avatar, Sully soon infiltrates the tribe - yet has to struggle with his conscience as he falls in love with a Navi huntress and the Navi highly complex traditions. In order to protect the natives, Scully will have to betray his own race...Admittedly, Cameron's plot isn't very original: it sounds like a Western at first, where Native Americans fight to protect their lands against the imperialistic settlers, pushing the Frontier westwards. Also, you could easily employ the movie's plot onto the colonial times, where colonists exploited the native tribes of Africa, depriving them of their resources, leaving only barren wasteland behind.The idea of the Avatar, however, is something that has never before been used so perfect: whereas it naturally offers a lot of potential conflicts and other problematic issues, the tension is rising with every passing minute - will the humans in charge just pull the plug? And although there are scenes which have been on the screen before, it never tires you.Not a single boring moment in 166 minutes - that's a new record, I reckon. There are no lengths whatsoever - every grand landscape shot is exactly where it is supposed to be, and the movie never attempts to substitute some intrinsic deficit with its excellent computer animations. The CGI is indeed revolutionary; and it is used to compose the movie's essence. Trust me, you have never seen anything like it before. James Cameron has created a fantastic world second to none - he has created a whole new exciting, thrilling universe that you won't want to leave once you've been sucked into it. After the 166 minutes I wouldn't have bothered to watch another two hours.Let's make this quick: if you are a fan of sci-fi and fantasy flicks, you are COMPELLED to watch this! Several times!Cameron's Avatar is by far one of the best sci-fi/fantasy movies in years; even the late Star Trek cannot compete with this one... it is just so compelling, so forceful in its aesthetics and tone... it is THE perfect sci-fi/fantasy movie! It was worth to wait this long! Ultimately, I can't think of any other director who could've developed such a visual masterpiece from a mere vision from 15 years ago.",positive
206,"I had higher expectations from this film, being a great fan of James Cameron's previous work, such as The Terminator and Aliens (his two best films, in my honest opinion), but this film simply disappointing. It is pretty much a vessel for testing special effects and is perhaps Cameron's worst film after Piranha 2, that's it, it is Cameron's worst proper film.The main problem of this film is simply that it is to dumb: it has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon and the characters lack any depth. So Cameron simply recycled the plot that was already used a hundred times before to test drive these new special effects. In essence, this film's only strength is its visual spectacle, which is amazing and that's why I gave it 6 points, otherwise it is just a boring dumb film.",positive
207,"Quite simply the most astounding movie I've seen as a visual experience.I am in awe.I hope Cameron makes a billion dollars for this truly amazing piece of art!Forget the people who talk about the storyline, the plot, as if it somehow fails to live up to the rest of the movie. This is a great story!--- this is sci-fi on a very high level. Is the story less than novel?----what stories aren't rehashes and blendings of other story lines...? This is a morality tale with good and bad very clearly drawn. It is a disavowal of technology and the greed that drives profit and power, and an extraordinary affirmation of the organic world, the vegetative and animal forces that constitute life.Others will comment at greater length of Cameron's rejection of man's attempt to conquer the universe by technologically violent means-----this is not that different a view than the one that drove John Borman's tale of the Brazilian native people's lives being destroyed by the advancing bulldozers in ""The Emerald Forest""----but more than that it focuses on the incapacity of those blinded by greed who cannot empathize with the sufferings of those they are harming. Cameron again is not inventing anything new, but taking a very old human story to very powerful heights. George Carlin would have loved this movie. It attacks some people as shallow and mechanistic, cruel and barbaric, narcissistically destructive... after seeing war movies for years of humans killing one another I must agree with Cameron.At one point the Na'vi are called ""blue monkeys"" by the humans..... human hubris denigrating non-human lifeforms. At another point the idea that there would be sacred areas to the Na'vi is laughed at by the corporate mercenaries------as if spirituality is either non-existent or only a human trait. Yet in Cameron's world the profit-hungry humans have no concept of God or spirituality at all----they are as soulfully dead as the machines they climb into----while those who live sans technology are very strongly spiritual. They are the essence of spiritual beings fully in touch with the life streaming through and around them.Good v bad. Mechanical worldview v pantheism. Pro-life v anti-life. Cameron's movie isn't about inventing these themes, only the way he portrays them with amazing beauty and boldness. I cannot say enough about the grandiosity of this cinematic effort. It is not only groundbreaking, but the first major step into the next wave of visual entertainment. The glasses-aided 3-D is superb, entrancing. The blend of CGI and actors is as seamless as the sky . . . will this lead to 3-D in home cinema, in TV broadcasting? Cameron is marking a trail that others will undoubtedly carve more completely. Tomorrow is bright with promise.Thank you, James Cameron. I love sci-fi when it is done well, and with ""Avatar"" you have done it as well as can be imagined, and better than anyone else previously has. A beautiful and timeless movie, ""Avatar.""I look forward eagerly to your future offerings.",positive
208,"Unfortunately Cameron looks down to the public and offers us a story so full of clichés and of a simplified view of the world, people and the Universe in general, that it is truly condescending. Neither he nor the studio behind him respect their audience. And after they sunk a reported 400 or so million in the project who can blame them? They need to recoup at least most of this money, and they do it by trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. I think Jim Schembri from The Age sums it up very well: ""There's no argument that, as a showcase for the immersive potential of 3D visual effects technology, James Cameron's sci-fi epic Avatar is an unqualified triumph. But as a story designed to engage, enthral and entertain adult audiences for almost three hours, it is a disappointment strewn with weak characters, environmental platitudes and anti-progress clichés. A compulsive envelope-pusher, Cameron invented a pioneering camera system and ground-breaking visual processing techniques for the film, but perhaps he should have spent a little less time obsessing over the technology and a tad more developing the story beyond the compendium of clichés it regrettably is."" My vote is 10 + 4/ 2 = 7.",positive
209,"I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised "" A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc "" . I'm one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering . On top of that I'm not someone who's going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses . It's bad enough being a speccy in real life . Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades ? In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at all In April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I'd seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR . Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you're able to concentrate on the story . The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there's nothing happening at allFault number one - there's very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie . Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white . Good guys ( Read humans ) are blacker than the darkest night while good guys ( Read blue skinned aliens ) are so white they're brighter than the sun itself. It's almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies . I say "" almost "" because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will . There is no complexity involved what so ever . The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there's no motives involved . Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn't a 3D gimmick and had saving graces . Take away the 3D and you'll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool . Also nice to know it was stuffed at the Oscars by the cheap and compelling tiny budget THE HURT LOCKER",neutral
210,"The first 10 rating I've given to a movie. Plot? Characters? maybe an 8 or so.. but still not weak enough to detract from the overall result. If you add action 10/10, CGI 13/10, imagination 13/10 I think it adds up to a perfect score. All I can say is that the CGI is so amazing in this movie that there were a LOT of FIRSTS for me: 1. found myself just staring at random parts of the screen to notice the amazing attention to detail. 2. found myself trying to figure out if some of the CGI were real camera shots blended in - it was so good it looked like a picture. 3. found myself thinking - this is the first CGI dominated film in which the CGI scenes trump the live actor scenes. I was slightly disappointed when Jake would leave his avatar and return to real life. 4. found myself not noticing an emotional difference between the real actors and the CGI characters. the movements, emotions, textures, and everything are superb! groundbreaking! 5. found myself attracted to a completely CGI character - Neytiri (mm...mmmmm!) To me this film is a first - it shows that we can now take the full extent of ones imagination and put it on film. Creativity + technology in the right hands has led to an amazing accomplishment.Go see it.",positive
211,"After seeing this movie Friday night, I don't see how anyone could walk out of the theater having watched this movie and not be impressed -- especially if it was seen in 3D. I saw this movie in Digital 3D and it was truly the most incredible cinematic experience I've ever had. I plan to re-watch it in IMAX 3D later on. What Cameron and his team created was more than a movie -- they created an experience, one that shouldn't be missed. If you miss out on this movie, you miss out on cinematic history. The world that Cameron and his team created is one you may never want to leave. I didn't feel the nearly 3 hour length of this experience -- to me, it breezed by. It's unforgettable.Granted, its familiar story has been told numerous times, but Avatar succeeds in making it feel fresh with new ideas and absolutely gorgeous beauty. The familiar story doesn't diminish the experience in any way. It's chalk-full of memorable moments and the final battle alone is worth the price of admission.See it. Really. I don't say this as a fan of this film, I say this as a fan of film in general.",positive
212,"Today I saw the beginning of a new era – I had the opportunity to be one of the first to see Avatar. I tell you! It is amazing!!! It is a must-see movie. Every one should experience it at least once. I can honestly call it my movie of the year. It might be even more than that – the movie of a decade. I had been waiting to see it, and for once my expectations were rewarded.It is a breath-taking almost three hour ride in the world you could not imagine existed. After the movie my colleagues were saying that they didn't want it to end. I felt the same. I didn't want to leave this dangerous yet amazingly beautiful place where everything is so bright and colorful, and exciting. It is amazing that there are people with imagination powerful and creative enough to bring such an experience for the rest of us. There were several people at the screening who originally were not interested in sci-fi or this movie in particular. They all liked it very much though. I believe it is due to the storyline. The story may not be the most original one, but it is that which moves all people at all times. It is a tale of love and fighting for a cause. It is a tale of a charismatic hero finding his true identity and place in the world. It is a tale where good triumphs over bad. This is what attracts people at all times. No more, no less. Just as important is the fact that the story is well told. You won't miss any details. Everything is explained well and to the point. There are no long overwhelming scenes. The story just moves fluidly forward and takes you on a magical ride. I must make a remark regarding the much-discussed technological achievements. CGI is incredible! You can't tell where the real thing ends and the CGI begins. Well, you can, but just because you know that it doesn't exist on our planet. It is so believable and therefore so fascinating. I despise those that claim that all of it looks just like a very expensive computer game. NO! It does not! Go see it! See it in 3D if possible. I feel that this new technology offers some great possibilities. It has been said that a new era in cinematography begins with Avatar. It so does and I cannot wait to see what it has to offer. So, I invite everyone to go and see this new world of Avatar. You won't be sorry!",positive
213,"I knew from the trailer it would have been a good one, but I didn't know how much I would love it. My idea of a good movie is the essence of something that has originality, insatiable acting and a whimsical storyline, something that I couldn't come up with myself. This movie really had me thinking of the possibility of another world like this one. James Cameron; the writer and director of this film found a way to create a mystical plot, beyond anyone's imagination unto the screen for us to enjoy and lament upon. Even the love story is unique and sensational, beyond words.I immediately did research upon returning from the movies, because I really enjoyed this one. I learned about the techniques used to digitize each actor and actress into their 'Na'vi' form and the exceptionally attractive artwork. I further discovered that the writer behind this movie had it set for release in 1999, but held it off until now because the technology introduced would not be as open to us now. We have seen many movies that presented technology that literally left you flabbergasted at the endeavor to create something beyond belief, but 'Avatar' would take your breath away.The names and the language within the movie would leave you wondering whether this language was 'the real deal'. I discovered that the language and culture of the 'Na'vi' was developed by Cameron himself. This creativity and professionalism was presented by Cameron in other films, but this one takes the cake.Set way into the future the plot revolves around the Na'vi and their homeland Pandora. Pandora itself speaks of a box which holds the evils of mankind and once opened, all the evils would be revealed. The choice of Pandora reflects the actual lifestyle of the Na'vi after the humans invaded their homeland.This type of inner depth which director James Cameron chose to develop was what impressed me most. I appreciated the relationship between Neytiri and Jake Sully. Sully himself was simple minded, but according to director Cameron; Sully would be 'a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world'. Very few movies com along like this one often and I was hooked from beginning to end. I remember a particular scene while the humans reigned doom on the Na'vi's and took away their promised tree, I had grown attached to these people so much that their pain was shared and Neytiri's expression and passion for her culture was welcomed with open arms.The Na'vi are essentially a huge family with deep ties among each other. It was amazing how open they were to teach others their traditions and were willing to merge 'an outsider' into their family. I can't grasp officially how the creation of this culture was done off screen, but I could truly believe and accept the possibility of there being a culture like the Na'vi out; a twelve feet tall race open to culture and nature. Their world actually seemed more functional and less complicated than the actual human lifestyle.There were a few inconsistencies within the movie, at least there were a few that others pointed out, that I couldn't have really cared less about. Sometimes when you are so in to a movie you begin to lose any curiosity into plot developments and just 'go with the flow'. There were such few, but the ones pointed out detailed the inability of the Na'vi's arrows to penetrate the flying machines in the first war fight and in the fight with Sully as lead, they easily penetrated the windscreens. My theory in defense of them would be the positions they captured in the first fight; it was weak and unplanned and the distance barely gave any harm, especially since they had no clear view of the screens and aimed relentlessly. A second inconsistency pointed out dealt with the humans' inability to breathe without their masks and then we have them breathing without out their masks in the end. My theory to counter that would entail a bit of uncertainty, but on top of that Cameron did list the possibility of sequel movies and maybe all of those would be explained.If it were me alone none of those mattered at all and the best parts of the movie, which is everything else, made me fall for it deeply beyond words. I would forever cherish one of the best couples created on screen; Neytiri and Sully. I admired the way Neytiri referred to Sully as 'Her Jake', which reenacted their love for each other and made me ignore the possibility for them to be together given Sully's situation. What impressed me further would have been the scene where Sully began to suffocate for air and Neytiri hurried to save him. Despite the fact that she realized his true form, she still loved him; she didn't mind holding a small man in her arms. To her it wasn't a small man, but 'Her Jake', however mushy that sounded.However soon the sequels arrive on screen, I would be one of the many awaiting in hope that they are perceived just as well as the first. I actually began this review a week ago and bit by bit, it came along. I just needed to get the words right and made sure the movie sunk in enough and I love it even more.Lexa Reviews http://lexabuti.blogspot.com ___________Five StarsGrade A++ ___________",positive
214,"Surrogates meets Apocalypto; Ewoks meets the Keebler Elves this is a visually stunning movie that's far more ridiculous than it is interesting. I saw it in 2D and I think the format will have a lot to do with one's enjoyment of the film. The entire first two acts are geared only to show off the visuals. The story itself boarders on the offensive but is poorly written in any case. Plot points involving a stereotypical military as the evil arm of corrupt corporations that want to harm innocents as well as ""great mother"" hippie babble surrounding tree energy reduce this film to epically absurd levels. The last film that gave tree energy this much focus was The Happening. Need I say more? It also wouldn't be much of a stretch to call this a 200 million dollar potential Al Qaeda propaganda film. The evil military use terms associated with the current Iraq/Afghan conflicts. Drawing parallels to American military action is a cheap shot by Cameron. Untrue, but his intent is clear even if he thinks it's veiled and clever. Ignorant politics aside, the third act does save this movie. The action as the CG natives take on the oppressive military is outstanding. I still think the CG movements are off in terms of realism but the action was impressive. Overall, I'm sure seeing the first two-thirds of the movie in 3D would've been better but as a film, it was almost painfully bad to sit through the presentation of glowing bugs, scenery and creatures in repetitive 2D.A VERY overrated film.",neutral
215,"Avatar is the first movie I've watched in 3D. The hype is that it is made to be watched in 3D, and the 3D is not some afterthought tacked onto the movie like some other 3D movies. But being this is my first 3D experience, I'm unable compare Avatar's 3D to other movie's 3D, but from what I've seen, it gives a different experience, but not really essential. I have to admit that 3D does add something to the experience of watching the movie, but what it adds just isn't enough for it to be something that will change how people go watch a movie altogether.Apart from adding something, 3D also takes something away. If you're not used to wearing glasses, then wearing those 3D glasses while watching the movie isn't really ""comfortable"". You never really forget that you're wearing glasses. The feel of it on your face, and the glass itself gives you a feeling like you're watching a movie through a window. And wearing glasses also makes the movie darker than normal. Some dark scenes become just too dark to see what's happening.But the CG in Avatar really does push the boundaries of what has been done before. What they've really nailed is the facial expressions on virtual characters. That, they got it almost perfect. But as for the human/humanoid body movement, they've got most of it right, but some if it just isn't that good. But one GC element that they made ""their's"" bio-luminescence. Nobody has done it, and if they have it was never as good as what is seen here. The CG of mechanical things like vehicles isn't the best of what we've seen. Transformers 2 did a way better job of it than Avatar. And the vehicle and mech designs in the movie seems as if James Cameron is stuck in the 90s. They seem dated.In the end, what makes a movie isn't the CG, it's the story. And the story in Avatar isn't a very original story. It is about humans trying to exploit the riches of a foreign planet at the expense of the aliens living there. Sure James Cameron did a great job of fleshing out the environment of Pandora, the alien planet, but as to what takes place on the planet, he could've done better. The dialog is very simplistic, but it's not as Star Wars prequel bad. There's nothing ""edgy"" to the story. It's very straight forward ,feels like it's a story made for a kids movie. There isn't any plot twists that turn things upside down.So it has beautiful CG, but has a mediocre story. It still can be enjoyable if it has great action. But I'm sad to say that the action does not redeem the movie to enter the ""enjoyably fun"" category. The final battle is a big one, but I never really got into it. Maybe it's the 3D glasses, maybe it's just the direction, but it didn't work for me. What makes an action scene work is choreography and damage. As for the choreography, there isn't really much opportunity to implement cool choreography in the action scenes as most of the action is organism vs. machine. It's organism vs. orgasm is where choreography can shine. And as for damage, in their effort to keep the movie PG, there is very minimal blood splatter, and the vehicular damage wasn't very dramatic.So there it is. Avatar. A movie that wanted to change things, and change may very well come if enough studios jump on the bandwagon, but if seen as what it is, a movie, it's just mediocre.",positive
216,"First, I'd like to say that you should be reading all these comments and reviews later, not before. Right now you should be seeing the movie, and you will not regret it, I promise. This isn't meant to be a review as such, instead it is a response to the very few people that mistakenly mark Avatar as having a cliché and dense storyline.I think one of the main reasons why we feel Cameron should have done a better job with the storyline is that he wrote this like 10 years ago, am I not right? I guess he just figured he'd use the storyline from back then, but in the meantime, there's been dozens, maybe hundreds of movies all using a storyline much like this one, because after all, it's what sells movies. I still don't consider this storyline ""bad"" though, because while it may have been done and said many times, this is the best iteration of it I've ever seen, and I expect that had this movie come out in 2001, I wouldn't even notice; I'd just call it epic all around.Besides, you can't try to compare this movie to some super realistic one, everything in it is drawing you into something very different from the reality that we live in. The GI Joe-like badass Marine dudes, their toy-like hovercraft and mechs, the blue furries, the overthetop lines, the overdone emotions that nobody in real life would have, the glow in the dark plants, the 6 legged creatures, the 3D..... All of these elements have been done over and over, but where this differs is that Cameron combines them all into something that just works. The people that are nitpicking on them aren't really nitpicking on the Avatar movie, because everything here is done splendidly. They're unknowingly picking on all the movies that did these things, but badly, and ruined us of these things forever.There's nothing wrong with naming something ""unobtanium,"" or having a GI Joe for your nemesis character, or having a 10 foot tall super hot humanoid-with-a-tail character, or a Pocahontas storyline; it's just that when we see those, we jump on all the failures related to them, and then somehow we think it was Avatar's fault.Anyways, enough justification, just go see it.",positive
217,"Along with every other late first-time viewer, I expect we had inflated expectations based on media hype and word-of-mouth. Most of the characters are so two-dimensional I expected them to disappear when they turned sideways. An exception is Sigourney Weaver's character; she got some of the best lines (at least the most of the laughs, wry or otherwise, from us), but isn't she yet tired of playing the star-crossed heroine fighting an alien force?The problem here is the story, or lack thereof. From the get-go, every major plot twist is not just foreshadowed but pointed to with big flashing neon signs reading ""WATCH FOR THIS IN A FUTURE SCENE"". The dialogue is often wooden (some of the worst lines are actually quoted in IMDb's ""Memorable Quotes"" section for the film); I heard nothing that reminded me of really good quotes from films like Aliens. The bad aliens/good locals is played as though the audience is completely new to the concept of the history of conquering invaders and downtrodden natives; contrast this with the really funny send-up of over-the-top PC sensitivity early on in Imaginarium, when the bobby has trouble working out how to refer to Verne Troyer's character. The lack of imagination (or intentional references to Native Americans) in using human-like natives with human-like voices and emotional responses is unfortunate; more interesting aliens were developed in The Abyss.The special effects are very good, although the small-frame 3D glasses used at our local theater really felt awkward and got in the frame of the projected image. The owl-eye polarized lenses used at other IMAX theaters were much more pleasant to use. I recall a better experience with Coraline's 3D projection, but I don't recall which style of glasses were used. The 3D visuals were nice, but they were abused by overuse–no opportunity to highlight the 3Dness of the film was left on the virtual cutting room floor. I would have been much happier with better dialogue, more story, and less special effects.It's not a bad film, and if one is interested in 3D CGI, this should be seen in a theater with the proper equipment (preferably one with large, polarized lenses). But if you've seen The Polar Express, you've seen a better film–story, acting, dialogue–than Avatar, and with 3D effects that better support the story and are not the only reason for seeing the movie. But I can't recommend it to anyone who is not dead-set on seeing it in 3D.",neutral
218,"BEST MOVIE IN YEARSi was blown away by how good this was and have now seen it 3 times at the cinema, this is a MUST see movie for everyone. It runs for around 2.40mins but i would have loved it to be longer. Everything in the movie is perfect from the acting to the story to the special effects! When the film first starts you will be thrown straight into the story. and from there its a wild ride in a perfect world for the next few hours. James Cameron really did think about everything in this movie, (SPOILERS ALERT) about mid way through the movie there will be an EPIC scene which will make you connect to the Na'vi and will (if you haven't already) fall in love with this film. it really was clever how James Cameron did this and one of the most emotional moments in a Sc-fi film i have ever scene! its beyond me how he made you connect so well to something that is not real but made you want to believe it was (SPOILERS OVER).If you are on the fence about seeing this film, its time to jump over it....MUST SEE 10/10",positive
219,"Saw it a couple weeks ago. I had high hopes for the movie, but it was't quite what I expected. All the great reviews and user comments and what did I get.... A mediocre movie with great special effects. The movie itself was predictable and I wasn't surprised even once during the movie. This was my first 3D-experience, so the first hours or so went to adjusting to 3D- image. It tells a lot about the movie, if you are more interested about the CGI than the movie itself. .I think this movie is highly overrated. The acting was OK, but nothing superb.This is not a bad movie, but I don't consider this to be one of the best movies of all time. Not even close.",neutral
220,"I'm speechless... utterly speechless! This movie has earned how much worldwide - over 1 billion dollars? Why? They say there are only 5 scripts in Hollywood and this surely confirms it. Throughout the entire time I'm thinking Pocahontas and believe it or not - Fern Gully. The visuals are pretty to look at with the forest being the leader. The forest during the day that is... because at night the forest turns into a Disney style show of corny ultraviolet foliage and grass that glows when you step on it (a la the video of Michael Jackson singing Billie Jean). Each animal is obviously based on an earth animal, only they have more legs or extra eyes – apparently this is what passes for imagination these days. And the floating mountains - Miyazaki pulled it off years ago in Laputa:Castle in the Sky, in this film they're just plain out of place. The love story is predictably obvious and boring. And hold off on the popcorn as large portions of dialogue about the back-story are forced down your throat in the most unintelligent and obvious way. As for the culture of the tribe... well it seems to be a mix of almost every stereotypical African and South American tribe, ever... rolled into one big ball of naf unbelievable tripe. In short this movie was really a waste of my time and money. And too paraphrase a review I once heard in relation to another disappointing film in recent years - With a budget $240 million this film really needs to be either a cure for cancer, or bloody entertaining; sadly it fails on both fronts. James Cameron – disappearing for another 12 years would be a true godsend!",negative
221,"I was not sure I would like this film. I really did not like Titanic, mainly because it's not my kind of film, so I wasn't sure if I'd like Avatar. I went to see it because people were saying that it had the better CGI than any other film, and it had five-star reviews all over the papers.I loved it! The film was action packed from start to finish! I do admit that only the very smart will get the plot at first, but everyone will have it by at least the middle. I hardly even noticed that the film was almost three hours!The planet Pandora is visually stunning. The plants are incredible, they light up, they move, some near the beginning even shrink! The Nawis, the natives to Pandora, are very life-like, I never even knew that they were computer generated!The action scenes (not giving any spoilers) are just fantastic! Everything is so realistic, the planes are realistic, the floating mountains are realistic, and the sound literally blows you away.The actors are very good, especially Sigourney Weaver. But if you have a young child, do not allow them to watch this. There is a minor bit of swearing, tons of blood violence and very loud sound. Overall, the film is just fantastic! You have to see this movie, as it is by far the most stunning film of the decade!",positive
222,"When I first heard about Avatar, earlier this year and I saw the trailers, I didn't had high expectations. I thought it was a movie filled with special effects, but with no original or interesting story, a movie where I could not care about the characters, like ""King Kong"" for example; I was mistaken. Visually, the movie is unlike anything I've ever seen in a cinema. And it's not only that, the movie has a soul.The story focuses on Jake Sully, a paraplegic U.S. marine, who in he future, travels trough space to the planet Pandora, a planet inhabited by the Na'vi, an indigenous alien race( although they have blue skin, they are very similar to humans). There he becomes involved with the Avatar project, and he submits himself to a process in which his consciousness is transferred to a Na'vi body. The military on Pandora are interested in a very rare and precious material, a sort of mineral, called Unobtanium. There are large quantities of this material in the place where the Na'vis live. Jake, in Avatar form, infiltrates the Na'vi, in order to gather Intel for the military, and if possible, convince the Na'vis to relocate. While living with them, Jake learns about their culture, their way of life and he starts to see the world trough their eyes. He practically becomes one of them, and he also falls in love with a Na'vi woman,Neytiri. The military are about to launch an attack against the Na'vi, and Jake is going trough an identity crisis, he has to find out who he is, and he has to choose a side in the imminent battle.James Cameron outdid himself with this movie,the motion capture technology used to create the Na'vi is just as good as the one used to create Gollum, in ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's hard to believe that there were no shootings done in a real forest, it all looks incredibly real. The movie is visually extraordinary, and as I said before, it has a soul. While watching the movie, you come to care about the characters, the Na'vis specially. This movie got to me in a way that only "" The Lord of the Rings- The Return of the King""( my favorite movie of all time) had got before. In the scene where the military launch their first attack against the Na'vi, destroying a part of their forest and killing some of them, I had to make an effort not to cry, my eyes were full of tears, and that is something that rarely happens to me, REALLY, rarely. The movie has a strong message of love and peace, it is an anti-war and anti-military movie, and also has a strong spiritual side. The way the Na'vis respect the nature, the animals and above all, life itself, is a lesson to all human beings. James Cameron had done great movies in the past, but never something as bold as this. To my eyes now, he is just as brilliant as a filmmaker as Peter Jackson is, and that's saying a lot. This movie is certainly going to be remembered as a milestone in movie making.",positive
223,"I waited over 1.5hrs in the queue to watch AVATAR. well I must say that it was worth the time and double or triple the money I spent on it... Fist I loved Terminator as a kid... then Alien 2 and T2... With T2 he borough 3D animated characters alive in the big screen.... followed by the massive Titanic. And today he has definitely revolutionized history of film making with AVATAR. Unfortunately I got to see the normal 2D version of it coz we don't get iMax theaters in our country yet... it did the magic. the AVATAR's and the Na'vis were really acting... Pandora was real... amazing art direction.... they have made a whole universe a real world out in that big screen. The details they have gone in to is just amazing. OK I'm just over-hyped after seeing the movie.... No its seriously amazing and hats off to Cameron and the crew. Talking about the story... it's simple yet flowing nicely where you get attached to. I fell in love with Neytiri.. :) Behind the plot it speaks to all the humans living in this planet earth about a common big issue which we don't realize or ignore. So there's lot more to get from AVATAR than the amazing graphics. I'm waiting to get the DVD with all the extras and the making of footages of the film. So go ahead enjoy and take the message of AVATAR... I'm sure there will be more to come in the future or better and new revolutions of movie making, but AVATAR is already a Classic... and in my opinion it should remain as it is with out sequels...",positive

225,"POSITIVES:1) As has been said a million times before, the visuals here are absolutely stunning. When you consider that this film came out in 2009 as well, it's so impressive. There are countless frames here that I wish I could hang up as art on my walls, and I spent pretty much the whole runtime in awe of the visuals
2) I really bought into Jake and Neytiri's relationship. I think this element of the plot is written very well. In fact, the whole plot element of Jake grappling to become part of the na'vi culture, whilst deciding that he wants to leave his human life behind, was probably my favourite element of the film
3) By the time the finale came, I was certainly ready for an all guns blazing action sequence, and the finale did not disappoint in that sense. It really feels like Cameron is in his groove hereNEGATIVES:1) Some of the writing is really poor in my opinion. There is a whole middle segment of the film where the film just grinds to a halt in the pacing, because the writing just has nothing happening other than Jake going on generic Na'vi side quests. Also, the humans lose the final battle against the Na'vi and they all just pack up and leave? Could they really not just get reinforcements and keep going? Or decide not to fight but still stay and try and negotiate? It's a really poorly written conclusion for me as it seems like they just wanted to wrap things up too quickly and neatly, which is inexcusable for a film that's over two and a half hours long
2) Most of the human characters are just painfully generic. Generic scientist, generic trigger happy military boss, generic corporate man who doesn't care about culture. It was honestly quite cringey at times.",positive

With that being said i would like to say that this story was better when it came out in 1990. What's that you say? oh, you never saw Dances With Wolves? Well if not, watch it. That movie is way better and is exactly the same premise. I'd get into it, but it's better off if you just look at it yourself.

Stream of consciousness/associative thinking might get it over with quickest.

231,"I was lucky enough to get tickets to see this in 3D yesterday - and boy, am I glad I did. AVATAR was...simply amazing. I can't think of a word good enough to give it the credit it deserves. What I thought was extraordinarily brilliant about this film was the way it made me genuinely dislike the race of human beings. The humans assume they know better, assume they are superior, and ultimately play the part of well, human beings, exactly right.There are scenes within AVATAR that depict a destruction of a beautiful world, and I literally had to hold my hand to my mouth for some of them in horror. In fact, a number of times I surfaced from my stupor and found my mouth gaping, along with my sister and all the rows of people next to me. The CGI effects of some of these scenes were incredibly well done, which meant that the scenes of destruction were especially shocking to the eyes.Indeed, I even found myself approaching tears a number of times throughout, which felt strange because I'm usually very hardy. However, the experience was so vivid and so intense that I just couldn't help but get completely sucked into the fictional world of Pandora. Even the Na'vi themselves - these huge, blue, glowing humanoids - the more I watched them, the less alien they seemed and the more...'human' they became. The transition the film takes to turn your opinion is just amazing. Rooting for the Na'Vi? You bet.""There's no green there. They killed their Mother..."" For those who are a fan of nature, of films like Fern Gully, this is for you. Just because AVATAR is of the fantasy genre, it doesn't mean it doesn't involve a very real, very relatable message for us all to pay attention to.This isn't just a film, this is an experience. You just have to see it. Beautiful, breathtaking, and nothing like you've seen before.",positive
232,"While watching Avatar for the first time, all I could think was, ""Wow."" Ever since I left, all I could think was, ""I want to see it again."" I actually did see it again. Yeah, I loved Avatar.To start, James Cameron's epic was visually amazing. The Na'vi looked real. Pandora looked stunning. The creatures were convincing. The human weapons, ships, robots were also realistic and believable. But enough about the CG and special effects, what about the story? Many action movies and sci-fi movies don't have much of a plot. Avatar does not fall in this category. Cameron layers this story, intertwining numerous different themes.The first evident theme is shown by Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Quaritch is hardcore, hardened military man. He shows no mercy to his enemies and is quick to decide you are his enemy. He had an unwavering prejudice of the Na'vi and those who side with them. He is eager to fight them. The underlining theme here is that some like Quaritch fight first, ask questions later. Military is shown in a negative light in this film, but it really isn't military, they are hired ""security"". This brings me to the next theme woven into this film.The next theme is that of corporate greed. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) is trying to please shareholders by destroying the home of the Na'vi to get the conveniently named unobtainium. He needs to make money at all costs. We see this around us every day. Greed. Love of money above the lives of others. It is sad, but true.Another theme I've noticed is that of love. Jake falls in love with Neytiri. Cameron is good at telling stories like these (Titanic). Just to be clear, though, this is NOT the main theme. Sure it is there, but it does not consume the story.I've only touched on those themes that are evident to me and more obvious. I'm sure there are many more--I just thought of one: redemption--but I just wanted to convey that this film is much more than pretty visuals and action. There is a heart and soul to this movie.There was solid acting all around. They aren't the biggest names in the film industry, but the actors in this film do their job. The musical score in this film is good, not great. James Horner's score in some places is spectacular and in others somewhat generic. I've listened to it separate outside the movie (and obviously during the film) and I like it. It doesn't match his work in Titanic, but it does the job well. On a side note, this movie doesn't feature unnecessary sex scenes, swearing, or any other garbage featured in a lot of today's movies; I was pleasantly surprised.Finally, the 3D is cool, but not needed. I think in someways it really adds, but really, the film doesn't need 3D to be a great film.P.S. Cameron said if Avatar is successful, he might make up to 2 sequels to it.I expected to enjoy this movie, but not this much. I'm not going to give any more away. I was truly drawn into the Avatar experience. I think you can be too.http://jimmyssweetblog.blogspot.com/",positive
233,"Of course I had heard the hype over Avatar for a long time, but just refused to believe it for many reasons. It seemed very overrated at first glance, as it probably did to most, and I really didn't care to see if for awhile. Now, I am so glad that I gave it a chance, because Avatar turned out to be a visually beautiful, incredibly written and wonderfully executed work of art that indeed is my favorite movie of 2009 and one of the best movies I've ever seen, and that's without me viewing it in 3D!First of all, yes, it does seem overrated at first glance. Even when the film started my thoughts were that it had pretty bad dialogue and that it was going to be incredibly crappy and a complete waste of my time. I changed that thought within the first twenty or twenty-five minutes of the movie. It begins to get so interesting and the characters start making an unbelievable impact on you and you really start to care for them and the story, within the first twenty or twenty-five minutes, I don't lie. It starts becoming more and more entertaining until you are completely mesmerized and astonished by how wonderful it truly is and how entranced you are in the film and how alluring it is to all your senses.The movie is amazingly brilliant and even though it was long, I was taking in every second with the utmost delight because James Cameron makes it so enjoyable to watch and has a direction that creates the most pleasurable and sensational atmosphere, as he's done with every movie I've seen by him. The actors and actresses capture their characters superbly as well and make them really believable and likable down to the very core. Sure, the movie didn't bring that much new material, but the way they handled it so delicately is what really pays off and makes the viewer tantalize every aspect.I thought the suspense, romance, action and all other genre mixes were balanced perfectly, and though the plot was paper thin, it was strong because of how amazingly beautiful the visuals were and how powerfully the actors and actresses make their characters, and how well the CGI makes it seem like you are actually on the planet Pandora and living every second of the film. Simply fantastic, I must say!Well, people who think it is still overrated after seeing it have probably disagreed with this by now, but if you are a fan of Avatar and appreciated it for the astonishingly magnificent piece of work that it is, I am right there with you. It was exciting and riveting to the bone with CGI and lush, picturesque scenes that are to die for. The plot was well done because of how wonderful every one that worked on the film makes it be and the movie was entertaining as hell. I am proud to say I enjoyed it highly and that James Cameron deserves all the money he received for this marvelous movie. After it was off, I wish it would've never ended.",positive
234,"OVER RATED i repeat, feel free to pass on the movie.",neutral
235,"I happen to be a huge fan of Cameron but I saw this with a few friends recently and found myself feeling guilty for having convinced them to go with me. Visually, it was a fantastic film but that's all it had to earn any fanatic response. The story itself I found boring, repetitive, and completely unoriginal. I even found the acting to be quit weak. I don't think Sam Worthington did a fantastic job with the character but I doubt he was casted with any great expectation of great delivery as was the same for Arnold in Terminator.I think the worst part of it all is that the studios are transferring every movie into 3D just because of the outstanding worldwide grosses for Avatar. But they're being lazy with it as well because so far they're just rushing into the process and not even shooting these movies in 3D. Instead, they're reformatting movies in 3D as was done with Clash Of The Titans which was horrible (another poor performance by Worthington) and The Last Airbender. This whole thing is turning out to be one huge glut fest.",neutral
236,"I just saw Avatar earlier this night and though I am still drunk off of its glory, my opinion of this movie will not change when I sober up. Also, it should be noted the theater I went to attempted to butcher my experience with the screen glitching half way through the movie and then about a minute of a blank screen and silence following- and yet still it could not kill the buzz that is Avatar.I went into the movie with great expectations and not surprisingly, it surpassed them. This movie is more than just watching a film, it is an experience. Avatar has it all: action, suspense, love, comedy, beauty, and digital 3d. I thought the plot was great, the acting great, and obviously the cgi is borderline unholy. The film also has some great messages weaved throughout the story, reflecting many different issues past and present.As much as I love watching and talking about movies, I have yet been this compelled to comment/review a movie on IMDb- I literally just registered to type this drivel.This movie took a fat budget to be created but by definition you can't put a price on a piece of priceless art.Bottom line...this is a must see and a must see in the movie theater in 3d.3/28/10 edit: Not so great. Still great, just not an emphatic great. I drop my rating by one star for a 9 out of 10. And I do not support the clicking of the box ""Yes"" to the question ""Was the above review useful to you?"" in regards to my above statement concerning Avatar.",positive
237,"Avatar is that rare film where everything you ever hear about it is absolutely true. All the criticism is valid and all the praise is justified. It really is the sibling of James Cameron's Titanic, in that it is a very ordinary story presented in an extraordinary fashion. Your opinion of it will be determined by whether you care about what a movie has to say or how it says it.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a crippled Marine in a future where a corporation has established a mining colony on the alien world of Pandora. Jake's twin brother was part of the Avatar program, where human beings have their minds projected into genetically engineered bodies that resemble the natives of Pandora, 10 foot tall blue humanoids called the Na'vi. The idea is that by presenting themselves in similar forms, they can more successfully interact with the Na'vi. When Jake's brother dies, the wheelchair-bound Marine is offered the chance to take his place because only someone with his brother's DNA can ""drive"" his alien form.When Jake arrives on Pandora and jumps into his Na'vi body, he finds himself caught between the scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who wants Jake to help her learn about the aliens and their world, and Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who wants Jake to get him militarily useful intelligence on the Na'vi. The head of the mining colony, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) doesn't care a whit about Jake, he just wants the Na'vi to leave their homes so he can dig up a mineral called Unobtainium which is worth 20 million dollars a kilo.You may have heard Avatar described as ""Dances with Wolves in space"". Well, that's a pretty fair characterization as the rest of the movie is all about Jake becoming part of the Na'vi, learning their ways, falling in love with a female named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually siding with the aliens in spectacular battle against the humans that are trying to exploit Pandora for their own needs.The computer generated images of Avatar are the most extensive and best looking stuff that's ever been on the silver screen. The scenery is incredibly detailed and realistic. The Pandoran wildlife and the Na'vi themselves are phenomenally lifelike. The advanced technology of the humans, like their Battletech-style armored suits, are more clearly defined and believably designed than anything you've seen before. And unlike some films where the CGI action sequences turn into little more than blurs of color and motion, Cameron is able to slow things down and keep things clear so you can follow what's happening in even the most dynamic moments. Watching this entire film is like the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or the morphing T-1000 from Terminator 2.Now, the verisimilitude of computerized special effects doesn't really blow me away. I certainly enjoyed looking at Avatar, but I generally need more than that and I just barely got it from this movie. This is an extremely formulaic and pedestrian story. There's nothing boring or stupid about it and if you took away all the CGI effects, this script wouldn't have made a bad film. It just wouldn't have ever been made into a film because there's nothing interesting or compelling about the tale Cameron has written. In fact, there are a couple of points where it seems like Cameron deliberately avoided more complex and potentially engaging story possibilities. I'm not sure if he wanted to keep the story as dumbed down as possible or if he simply focused too much on the special effects, but this is probably the least dramatically ambitious tale Cameron has ever told.Avatar is a fun, exciting film to watch. I can recommend it with no reservationsbut unless you're obsessed with the latest advances in CGI technology, I can't really call it a ""must see"".",neutral
238,"How often do you get to see a turning point in cinematic history? Not in hindsight, but as it is actually happening? Not often. Those watching The Jazz Singer in 1927 (debut of audible dialogue) or Becky Sharp in 1935 (introduction of Technicolor) experienced it. I wasn't born for another eight years, but I have read and heard that when Star Wars first came out in 1977 people were feeling a similar way; that they were witnessing something never before seen that would change movies from that point on. Has it really been 32 years between motion pictures that have had this impact? Well, revolutionary movies wouldn't be revolutionary if they came along all the time.James Cameron's long-awaited, much-touted 3D motion-capture technique is a step towards the future. What we see on screen during Avatar is nearly impossible to explain with words. But I'll try. Do you think 3D is just a gimmick? Think again. The depth and clarity afforded by the third dimension is invaluable; it immerses you into the action so well that you aren't sitting in a cinema for three hours, you enter a whole new world. Forget the blurry patches to the sides of the screen or the impossibility of seeing things that are moving too fast, as experienced in previous 3D flicks, with Avatar you see everything as if it were real.The digital surroundings that Cameron has created (so he could shoot his actors with mo-cap in an environment that already existed) are awe-inspiring. Pandora is a beautiful forest and jungle-like land, whilst its non-Na'vi inhabitants are exotic and exhilarating in equal parts. The realism of this fantasy world is extraordinary; from the opening shot to the closing credits, Pandora and all its creatures do exist. In addition, and most importantly, the motion-capture technique used for the Na'vi is astounding. Cameron's groundbreaking technology enables the Na'vi to look, move and interact realistically; the smallest of nuances from the actors, including pupil movement, have been mimicked flawlessly onto their digital counterparts.The aforementioned visual revelations are unsurprisingly marvellous during the action sequences – the climactic battle is undoubtedly the standout – however they lend themselves to the subtler scenes just as well. Cameron refuses to use his pioneering invention just for spectacle; he wants it to assist in capturing the minds and hearts of his audience. Take for example a couple of the scenes where the Na'vi fly on their local birdlife. To experience something so graceful and elegant, yet so thrilling and jaw-dropping, is where the real pleasure lies.Most gratifying is not all the optical splendour on offer mind you, it is the powerful tale that it is in aid of. Cameron's account of love, war and nature is more affecting than you might expect. Avatar boasts a screenplay which at times will make you laugh, at times make you cheer and at times make your heart heavy. It never neglects the story and even infuses the action with a surprisingly high level of emotion. A pivotal scene midway through where the humans launch their first attack is genuinely gut-wrenching and shattering; evoking similar feelings you get when watching the atrocities committed in wars gone by. Cameron is greatly assisted by James Horner's booming score too; it's African-esquire sounds giving it an exotic and poignant feel that match the proceedings perfectly.Hollywood's new kid on the block, Aussie actor Sam Worthington, delivers a star-making performance as the conflicted Jake that, along with his turns in Terminator Salvation and the upcoming Clash of the Titans, will surely see him catapult to the top of the A-list. The unrecognisable Zoe Saldana is breathtaking as Neytiri; Sigourney Weaver adds her usual class and elegance as the 'mother' of the Avatar program, Dr Augustine; Michelle Rodriguez gives a career-best performance as the cocky yet likable pilot Trudy Chacon; whilst Stephen Lang makes one heck of a badass.James Cameron: thanks for giving this 24 y.o. his first chance to witness a turning point in cinematic history. It will not be forgotten.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",positive
239,"A year after all the hype for this movie and I finally decide to write my review... but only after I watch it again on DVD.I have to admit, this movie is actually better in 2D. I could look at all the pretty things without staring at migraine-inducing blurry nothingness for three hours.I tried to suspend disbelief while I watched this movie. It didn't work the first time, and it didn't work this second time. I couldn't really enjoy this flick as I have that other terrible movie, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen. At least with that movie, one can sit there and enjoy the CGI without being too distracted by the lousy storyline.I face palmed often throughout my second viewing of this ridiculous, corny flick. Its story is beyond stupid, it is so insipid and so utterly lame it completely unraveled the great work WETA Digital did for this movie. It is totally impossible to sit there and enjoy WETA Digital's CGI effects without Mr Cameron's lousy, political environmental, anti American (LOL, isn't he a white American too) agenda slamming into your face over and over and over again.OK, Mr Cameron. I get that the Human Race are nothing more than hideous, evil orcs, trolls and goblins using advanced technology to kick the noble, beautiful, blue-skinned, cat-faced, 10 foot tall American Indians off their land so they can get the filthy rich Unobtainium all for themselves. Because, the evil corporation headed by that airhead white American CEO don't want to save the Earth with that stuff, oh no. They just want to shove it all in a bank vault and let this Unobtainium's value increase over a few decades give or take. This should send their corporation's shares through the roof, they'll be the richest evil humans in the history of human kind!!!This movie's portrayal of the American Military was idiotic, unbelievable and poorly presented and like the evil, vindictive, greedy, planet-raping American corporation, just as ridiculous and cliché riddled.Characters were horrible caricatures and acting was by-the-numbers cliché cardboard cutouts. Mr Worthington was especially poor and laughable, as was his co-star, that screaming, hissing, crying, over-emoting soapy, the giant blue cat-chick. Her performance was creepy, horrible and unbelievable. She knows this dude is a human, yet she still lays down and has sex with him? WTF? In the most awkward fail of a sex scene I've ever seen in a movie. So their sex is the same as ours? Their genitals are the same? They have human woman breasts, just on giant ten foot tall blue emaciated smurf bodies. They suck face the same too, just with vampire teeth and ""hair plugs"". Uggghk.The flying scenes weren't as good as the flying scenes in How to Train Your Dragon. Wall-e was better with its environmental message. Heck, even Princess Mononoke has a better story concerning Earth, Forest guardians, and protecting the environment. Plus, the characters from these movies have more personality and humility, which not a single character from Avatar has. I didn't even like Sigourney Weaver's character, and she's an awesome actress. I still don't get how a dumb, trigger-happy marine could suddenly go from crippled nobody to the Na'vi's version of Return of the King! That not even the scientists could achieve, and they'd been on that planet, what - five years? Rolls eyes. The worst aspect of this ""film"" was the battle scene at the end. The idiot marine-come-smurf decides the only answer to a conflict is to inflict genocidal murder and violence. Rolls eyes. You'd think a movie three hours long would see him change from trigger-happy gun-toting douche-bomb to someone understanding that violence is definitely NOT the answer. Nope. Now he's a red-bird riding, gun-toting, trigger-happy, arrow shooting war-smurf on the absolute, murderous, anti-human rampage. Rolls eyes.And to add insult to injury, he willingly offs himself (no conflict in sight here though!) so he can keep that nice piece of tail all to himself forever and ever.What a fairytail ending to a fairy tale masquerading as a ""science fiction epic"".BOO!!! Mr Cameron!!!1/10",negative
240,"I've just returned from this amazing cinematic experience, and agree with all the raves about the technical expertise and effects that make this film stunning, the music which truly makes the spirit soar, and the amazing acting, from every single actor stretching their limits. But the clear messages that were being presented and sometimes bombarded at the audience were what really blew me away. As I sat and allowed myself to be entrenched in this fantasy world, it was as if I was hearing the voices and cries of thousands of generations of peoples and thousands more of animal and plant species that have been wiped off the face of the earth. ""We will fight terror with terror!"" the character of Stephen Lang shouts before attacking the natives, in a blatantly satirical ""kill all the hostiles - ie women, children, and people generally defending their homes"" scene. What a genius way of summing up the untold violence and stupidity of Western war mongers. It makes sense that Cameron is Canadian born. (says a fellow Canadian!)Any film which can convey such commendable messages without being didactic and be so utterly entertaining and visually beautiful deserves my ten.",positive
241,"I have registered only because this AMAZING movie and even my poor English I have decided to write short review.I expected something special but what I saw in the cinema completely sucked me up there...with wonderful feelings and tears in my eyes. Performance, story, acting and music...all fit perfectly. We can not even name it a movie...it is more than it...Mr.Cameron made the dreams come true...I have been in the world I always wanted to be in and I want to come back... And that is why I go to see it again..and again.. Absolutely extraordinary!!!!",positive
242,"I sat for 3 hours this afternoon slack jawed, mesmerized and awed to have the privilege to experience this Masterwork. At times I completely forgot about the special effects and felt that I was actually visiting another, incredibly breathtaking world. But no more beautiful than the Earth: the Garden of Eden she used to be. James Cameron has brought the art of visual storytelling and it's audience to a whole new dimension.To those who feel the story has been ""done before,"" and/or the plot is too simple: You must understand that this is a morality play. Right is right and wrong is wrong. Many movies have used similar archetypal themes. They're universal. Just read ""The Power of Myth,"" by Joseph Campbell. Each story tells the Hero myth in a different way, but with the same theme. And of course the analogy to Native Americans is inescapable, but the technique in which it is conveyed is unique unto itself. The actors: from the Zoe Saldana's blue skinned, nine foot Goddess Neytiri, to Sam Worthington's heartbreakingly paraplegic Marine. The ever radiant Sigourney Weaver and every character in between are absolutely excellent and have totally immersed themselves in their roles. But the star of the show is the moon of Pandora itself. It's most incredibly beautiful place that it almost defies description. The sweeping score along with the amazing imagery just underscores the epic grandeur of this film. But in the end this is a message movie. The message, the warning and symbolism are clear: The Na'vi are our ancestors before we became ""civilized."" At the core of this film is a childlike heart of innocence and wide-eyed optimism that maybe it isn't too late for us if we can manage to wrest the stewardship of our own planet from the Corporate/Military Industrial Complex. Nothing is more precious than our home. I feel humbled, uplifted, and yet ashamed of my apathy. This movie is more than a movie on so many levels: It is an experience, a true event. I can't wait to see it in an IMAX theatre, that is when it isn't sold out. I have never been so touched by any film as I have been touched by this one. I'm so grateful to have been introduced to this new 3D film technology with this exquisite, incredibly crafted and beautiful Masterpiece from the film God: James Cameron. I've already seen it again in 3D and it was even better the next time. I'm sure I'm going to be going again and again. To say that I am pleasantly astounded is an understatement! The last time I got this excited for the future of film making was ""Star Wars"" and the LOTR's trilogy. But be warned: It's hard to watch another movie after this one. Nothing else compares. It is in a league by itself. I wish there were more than 10 stars for this vote. It's off the charts, like a rare diamond, it is priceless. Tonight I looked at the Earth around me with a newfound wonder and reverence. This is truly a landmark film and an astounding achievement!!!!",positive
243,"This movie is perhaps one of the most spectacular I have ever seen. Throughout all three hours or so, I was held spellbound by the scenery, action, and storyline of James Cameron's dream. I do not think I glanced at my watch once throughout it, and I can honestly say that I didn't want it to end.First: the visual effects were absolutely stunning. James Cameron did not just create a world; he created an entire ecosystem that could be plausible if we didn't know better. The first time the Na'vi were seen, the person I was with leaned over and asked me if they were costumes or special effects, they were that real. The Hallelujah Mountains looked amazing, and the wildlife, although it would be frightening in real life, was just stunning.Second: the themes were great. Although stone-hearted critics (like the ones on here who gave it a 1/10) may argue that it was unoriginal and a direct copy of other movies, there are very few movies coming out nowadays that you couldn't say that about. I noted themes in this from several different movies, the most prominent being Dances with Wolves, but that wasn't the only one. It also took a theme out of real life: people destroying the environment for such petty things as money. The reality of it is one of the most disturbing things in that film.Third: the storyline was great. It does have similarities to Dances with Wolves, but there was so much more to it than that that you really could not say they were the same thing. Dances with Wolves did not go into the training nearly as much as this did. There are several others, but I won't name them all.Basically, this film is about as epic as you can get, and shame on all of you who think it was bad because it took themes from other movies and enhanced them. You will never find a movie that doesn't.",positive
244,"After I saw Terminator 2 at the cinema when it first came out, I had to recover for a day or two. When I started getting my thoughts in order, I realised two things: one, the film had state-of-the-art special effects running all the way through it and, two, those effects were always in service of the story, and never the other way round.Some consideration of Cameron's filmography makes it clear that, while he is a director who is keen to push the envelope - The Abyss and Titanic also come to mind as movies where effects are pushed into new areas (and I include physical effects as well as photographic and CGI), there is always a strong human heart beating in the film, and you never find yourself thinking that here is a filmmaker who has discovered the bundle of tricks which is CGI, now what can I hang them on? (koff koff Roland Emmerich anyone?) So I watched Avatar on two levels - what it looked like, and what it felt like. As it happens, that's not a bad basis on which to review it, notwithstanding that the essence of successful film-making is that the two should be inextricably tied together.So what does it look like? I'm a sucker for eye candy, and the answer has to be ""Absolutely stunning."" Breaking the visuals down into sections: The human locations and hardware are very reminiscent of those in Aliens, and the powered exoskeletons (viz Ripley's fight with the Alien queen in Aliens) make a reappearance, big time; The Pandora vistas are both sufficiently earth-like to enable you to identify, and sufficiently other-worldly to place you on another planet; The Pandora flora and fauna are spectacular, and brilliantly well thought out. I particularly loved an element which hasn't been shown in the trailers, involving the plaits which the Na'vi wear.Do you believe in what is shown to you? Well, for the first few moments you marvel at the eye candy, and then, yes, you accept what you're seeing. In particular, the Na'vi are real people within a few minutes of meeting them. I was disconcerted to find myself quite fancying an 8 foot tall skinny blue woman with cat's eyes.The 3D is also amazingly effective in immersing you in both the gritty human locations and also the alien world of Pandora - do try to see it in 3D if you can.But what of the story? Let's be honest, you're likely to have encountered this tale before. Technology-heavy invaders are determined to acquire a natural resource: unfortunately, this resource lies under a particularly sacred site belonging to an indigenous tribe (think Amazonian rain forest, think buffalo herds), so someone is sent to infiltrate but ends up seeing the beauty of the life pursued by the underdogs, and changes allegiance. Factor in a romance between the infiltrator and the chieftain's daughter who is delegated to train him, and you have a formula story which is likely to be quite familiar.But it's unfair to level that as a criticism. The reason it's a familiar story is that it's a good story. Filled with tension and audience sympathy for the underdog, it works as well here as it has worked in previous incarnations, and the science fiction trimmings add complications and additional story elements. You do genuinely care for the plight of the Na'vi, and you want the romance between Marine Jake Sully and his Na'vi princess to turn out well.I must say that Cameron's films generally - and Avatar is no exception - are not films which are going to rank as great cinematic statements. What they are, without exception, is fantastic big screen entertainment - they engage, transport, and carry you along. They are rattling good yarns, delivered by a master storyteller. And, again, Avatar is no exception.Cameron said that he wanted to make a film where you wouldn't be able to tell where real life ended and CGI began - he has achieved that. And he also said that he was aiming to create CGI faces which the audience could accept as real faces, and which didn't have the deadness behind the eyes which we have seen as recently as Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol. I think he has achieved that, too. If nothing else, this is another of Cameron's films which will stand as a milestone of technical achievement, but it is also a hugely entertaining movie, and one where the story comes first.",neutral
245,"Tried to see Avatar opening weekend on the IMAX 3D but sold out. Saw it on a regular screen. Since then I was at lunch with some friends from school and all they kept talking about was the way it looked so real in 3D and how they felt like they were surrounded by the 3D flakes, and how the Avatar world and it's inhabitants looked so real, and how it didn't feel like CGI and so on. I wanted to jump in and be part of the conversation but I felt like I missed out because I didn't get the 3d IMAX experience. So I went this week and saw it in all it's glory in the 3D IMAX, and I realized something. I thought it was definitely cool, all the special effects and all that technical stuff, but then I realized something half way through the movie–it's a regurgitation of the story of Pocahontas, with the names changed to protect the innocent. I thought to myself, this movie is a revolutionary step in film making as far as special effects, but the story isn't. That disappointed me. How come film makers or Hollywood don't have an original thought? Don't get me wrong, once in a while something will go to the independent theaters that gives us something new. But why, even in a movie with so much special effects planning and all, do they still have to steal from another story? End of the day, if you are going to see Avatar, it's a must see on the 3D IMAX screen. And the execution of the movie is brilliant, but the story...well...I read it in middle school.",neutral
246,"I went into the theater not knowing what to expect on this one. I didn't have high expectations in the slightest. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG! This movie took number 1 on my movie list by leaps and bounds. From the plot, character development, CGI effects, everything! This movie is legit and I would gladly go see it again if opportunity arose! The best part i think was the character development and the high amount of emotion in this film. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but i definitely suggest to go see this movie--now. The language isn't perfect, but it's cleaner than most movies nowadays and it flows into the movie very nicely and is kind-of a must have in the areas it is placed. Definitely 10 stars and more if I could give them. Props on this one! Fantastic movie!",positive
247,"Really, with all the hype going on about Avatar and its immensely rising status as 'greatest piece of cinema' and 'best selling piece of... anything', I just had to see what the fuss was about. And for the life of me, I don't see it.First off: to praise a movie JUST for its 'graphics' is bullcrap to me. Flash makes a movie easier to watch and makes it easier to believe what's being displayed on screen, but that doesn't make any of the plot, the writing or the acting better. With that said I will admit that most of Avatar does look good, except for some animals and other details. But what does that matter? It could've been 2D for all I cared. I've seen a lot of anime and I'm always more impressed with amazing 2D animation than CGI (maybe that also has to do with me being an avid gamer, meaning 'stunning 3D visuals' are daily matter for me). So yeah, it looks neat most of the time.But when you get down to the bare essentials, there's just not a whole lot to look at. I simply sat in my chair watching, waiting for something to take me by surprise or... something. All the characters are stereotypical, the dialogue never is interesting or creative and the plot is pretty much Pocahontas/Dances with Wolves or what have you. Never was I clueless to what was going to happen, and never did I care. Why would I? The characters were like eighties cartoon characters; good guys are naive and get themselves in stupid situations, bad guys are EVILLLLL² because being evil is where it's at! When I was watching GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra, I was expecting this, but not with Avatar, currently #51 of the top 250 of IMDb. My god, how embarrassed I was at the shallowness of James Cameron's writing.When a movie tries to convey a message and tries to connect with its viewers on an intellectual level, it should not at the same time underestimate that very same audience. And the message is laid on so thick that it doesn't hit home, it just bumped me in the forehead while it was trying to force its way down my throat. So here you have a story with unbelievably stereotypical characters who have to play their part in an epic about imperialism and self-discovery, but you just don't care. Also, the message is mostly one-sided and there is no sign of any relativity whatsoever. So any opportunity to add some depth was left untouched, sadly, which makes Avatar a lot like a kid's novel with a moral at the end of the story. It leaves nothing to think about and it presents its points in a, dare I say, pubescent fashion.All that aside: Avatar is a blast to watch if you can turn your brain off and just look at the purty pictures. With all the predictable build- up, mindless action and other 'never really intense' moments, you can simply sit back and enjoy the ride. But when you look at its intent, I say 'meh, I've seen better'. I just couldn't connect with anything portrayed on screen, and why so many others could, I will never understand.",neutral
248,"James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better, and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production, the marvelous and wonderful ""Avatar"", a film with non stop energy that entertains, teaches, and delights us. Though not completely original, the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screen.""Avatar"" is the story of the conflicts between two worlds, one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit, and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight. As we are introduced to the wonders of Pandora, an ironic name if any, the wonders begin. Cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination, with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes, fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous CGI creatures, come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""King Kong"", but the new animals show more force and agility, and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to be.The crowning jewel are the humanoids native to Pandora, tall and proud blue skinned beings, lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast. A million years ahead of the work done with similar process by Zemeckis in the disturbing ""Polar Express"" and ""Christmas Carol"", the people from Pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently, and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak. Most incredible work is done by Worthington and Saldana, as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each other.Humand eventually try to encroach over the people of Pandora's natural resources, by any means necessary, and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives' spirits. These are powerful scenes, full of an intensity rarely seen in epic/fantasy films, and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by Scott in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and Stone's ""Alexander"", a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element, spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination, and the results are magnificent.Finally, I can't heap enough praise upon this sensation movie, the best of 2009, one that is as powerful as ""Departures"", as imaginative and entertaining as ""Star Trek"", full of some of the wonder of ""Up"", and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of Robin Williams in the ""World's Greatest Dad"" and Jessica Biel's and Kristin Scott-Thomas in ""Easy Virtue"", films that like ""Avatar"" are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power. How does one know that a film will become a classic? When one leave the theatre and can't wait to see it again for the sum of its parts, not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film, or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold. Cameron has made sure ""Avatar""'s separate parts all work in tune, from its performances, to its screenplay, to its editing, and special effects, never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us. A great film.",positive
249,"Every so often a movie captures your heart and mind; Avatar does just that. The twelve year wait for Cameron's fantasy feature was well worth it in every sense of the word. I saw the movie at midnight and as soon as the credits popped up at the end of the movie I immediately wanted to watch it again. Words cannot describe the beauty of this movie, both in scenery and story. Whether or not you enjoy watching fantasy movies, you must go see it. Hopefully Cameron is already preparing to make a sequel. I thought that the blue people would be initially hard to swallow, but they have a sense of beauty to them that you can only get by getting connected to these ""people"" from the story and every thing that makes them and the movie interesting.",positive
250,"This film has nothing worthy of the box office receipts is has garnered. Any third grader can predict the outcome after the first ten minutes. The plot, characters, and themes are either one dimensional or blatant rip offs of earlier tales. Even those parts of the movie that are rehashing some of the great movies of history are delivered without any depth or structure. Consider the poorly constructed moral and it can be seen that it could have been stolen from ""Dances with Wolves"" and others before it, but taken without the bones to support it.Special effects were interesting, but again lacking in any thought to character development. Creatures of this other world were clearly developed in an attempt to make them look ""cool"" without any thought to the evolutionary challenges that may have helped to shape them.It is possible that there is an intended message relating to the tension between science and religion, but it is hardly worth trying to evaluate the directors message. There is so little substance to this movie that the only possible conclusion that one could come to is that the analysis was not worth the effort.",negative
251,"I want to say for one, that this movie was EXTRAORDINARY! And for what it's worth comes everything you can't possible imagine of what Cameron had in store for the audience. It was mesmerizing to see that the 3-D lived up to its hype and and wowed everybody in my theater. Like only 2 people used the bathroom within a 2 and half hour period!? That is the mark it left with audiences when it first appeared on screen. Nobody knew what to expect, and in the following, everyone got what they didn't expect which was lush colorful movie with some great CGI that was perfectly complimented with a great story... Some will beg to differ, but the real star is the 3-D. Yes, the 3-D! Wow, It has as of today changed the way will see our entertainment and how we view it. So ladies and guys I would prefer everyone to see this cause it is only worth the time on the big screen while still in 3-D format. 20/10..",positive
252,"First of all, I'm writing this mainly to thank all the people behind this motion picture. Especially the art department. You guys have made something that has touched people's minds and will be remembered as a milestone in cinema history for ever. I don't know if any of you will ever read this entry but, I hope you do. So I thank each of you for your effort and divine like skills. A special thank you goes to James Cameron. Thank you for this wonderful movie. You have immortalized your self with this picture and will be remembered like a pyramid in the history of motion picture by many.I don't want to spoil anything in this movie. I can only say that I fell in love with a CG character (Neytiri) for the first time. It's odd, but true. I have never seen a CG characters out preform real ones :D. They were so well done that sometimes during the viewing, I refused to think that they were CG characters. I know that the voices of the actors played a big role, but without the magic of the 3D artists and animators, none of it would have been possible.This movie will melt the heart of the most ""stiff"" and ""hard-to-please"" movie critics. If you love sci-fi, then it will totally blow your mind away.I don't care if there will be a sequel to this movie or not. But I care, and hope that James Cameron won't sell this franchise like he did with Aliens. That would lead to disaster. How you would feel if someone like ""Paul W.S. Anderson"" came along and took a big dump on it? Just the thought of it makes me shiver.Oh well, I could go on for ever, or even write a book of the feelings I got for this movie. Plain and short this is how me and my friend felt/thought when we walked out of the theater with a tingling sensation....""we're not worthy"", ""wow"", ""James Cameron is GOD"", ""Why am I feeling this way"", ""how is this possible"", ""how can I possibly feel love for a CG character"".",positive
253,"Although ""Avatar"" may not be James Cameron's greatest story I consider it a great popcorn movie. It is a film, that should work fine even without IMAX cinema - however with 3D for me it was fantastic! Already once Cameron took a lot of risk with ""Titanic"". Back then his success was nothing you could have expected back then! His newest creation is no less risky but it seems it will work out perfectly fine.What has always impressed me considering this director and writer (especially when thinking of his movies ""The Abyss"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens""...): nothing in Camerons script seems to be coincidence. Everything seems to have a profound reason. Every picture is thoroughly thought. Same holds true for ""Avatar"". Its plot provides several typical Cameron elements: the clash of different worlds, technology versus nature, progress versus tradition, human species crossing a crucial line and so on. I heard it reminded several viewers of films like ""The Last Samurai"" but I'd say the meaning of this story goes deeper. It's not just about how we deal with other cultures and traditions, it's about how blind we deal with nature.During this picture, you can almost feel how its 3D technology is evolving. The director and his crew were painting an image of colossal size, merging tons of impressive ideas from all directions (movies, nature...). So far I have never seen anything as detailed. It's like seeing (feeling in some way) a different world - which from my point of view is ""Avatar""'s greatest strength. This time the very archetypal plot is no more than a fancy (though not less moving) accessory.Easy to see I'm very positive about this movie. On the other hand - without 3D and especially on a TV screen - I could imagine that ""Avatar"" might have some lengthy moments. I assume that probably 3D needs more ""lengthy"" moments to relax than 2D. In my point of view Cameron chose the right pace and you'll have enough time to become familiar with this new world. There are several moments, when ""Avatar"" is like a ""prototype"", where not everything is perfect. And yes, the quality of 3D varies and some images seem to have little space, whereas others look totally overwhelming. But from my point of view the story is strong enough overcome little flaws.Summing up: ""Avatar"" is offering a truly wonderful impression of what is possible, how cinema can/will be plus even more and also a very moving story which hopefully will create a more positive spirit towards nature. A film which already is one important brick in the wall of film history !",positive
254,"Make no mistake that this is something you have never seen before. I find it hard to call a film because it was so much more. The immersing nature of the visual aspects of the film are breathtaking. Your mouth will remain open for large sections of this movie.I was there for all the big step ups in film making technique. Terminator 2, Titanic, Lord of The Rings and the new Strawars. All of them did that job, astounding work for their times and amazing achievements. But, I never left the cinema after them the way I did from Avatar. You truly feel you have just witnessed something special, something defining, something of our time. A culmination of years of film making to get to this movie. As far as this movie looks, it is simply perfect.The story is captivating and the characters engaging. It's a tale told many times before, but almost everything is just a variation of older work. But there is so much more depth to this story and a single viewing is unlikely to reveal them all.I don't know if the movie will be the same when I finally own the DVD and play it on my HD. Can that cinema experience transcend to TV screens? Time will tell.If you are waiting for DVD, you'll be missing out on something spectacular. If you can get to an I-Max, or see it in 3D you should try, but at the very least go see it on the big screen. You'll be so glad you did",positive
255,"Avatar has received an absurd amount of hype as the movie that will change the film experience forever. And from a purely visual standpoint, the film lives up to it. As Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his blue buddies roam about the spectacularly crafted planet of Pandora, you feel as if you're running alongside them, and the ""intense epic battle sequences"" (as the PG-13 rating description calls them) are all of that and more. This is a movie that can only be seen in 3D, and it pushes the technology to heights it has never reached before.It is unfortunate, then, that a movie with such visually-stunning potential falls so flat. The film is filled with melodramatic lines like ""It started just as orders... but then I fell in love with the forest,"" and though the acting doesn't damage the movie, it certainly doesn't elevate it either. But the movie suffers most heavily from its plot, which is the most predictable one in a serious film in my memory. The few plot points that were not immediately clear from watching the television commercials became clear while watching the movie at least an hour before they actually occurred, and the entire film was oddly reminiscent of Disney's Pocohontas. Pocohontas, however, provides more depth; Avatar includes no moral questions or quandaries. The good guys and the bad guys emerge within the first twenty minutes of the film, and for the rest of the movie the good guys do nothing bad and the bad guys do nothing good. And that, ultimately, is Avatar's biggest failure, that though it is a film that presents cinematic beauty in every color imaginable, it has no shades of gray.",neutral
256,I found the movie was very boring to watch for the second time and pretty much slept in the cinema hall and the other reason why I am just giving a 7 for a movie so well received by the audiences would be seeing the movie District 9 for the 5th time after watching this movie and not getting the bored at all.James Cameron really needs to take inspiration from Neill Blomkamp(Director of District 9) to how to make movies economically after all it is the the time of recession. District 9 is pretty much the same story except that it takes place on earth and made at a budget of just 30 million and James Cameron spends 10 times more developing new technology and cameras to make this movie.Well I can go on all day like this but the final verdict is that Avatar can be watched once that to for it visual effects and the movie could have been better if it was a bit more short.PS I did'nt watch the movie in 3D this is a 2D review,positive
257,"Rather than being a great movie and best effects ever seen till now, I have to share that I have lived another life in this movie, maybe in a world inside Cameron's mind.This is not just a movie, its an amazing experience that you'll feel like you are in a dream and you do not want this dream to end.No one can just describe AVATAR in words, its just so strange, you when you experience some thing for the first time, and its so strange but at the same time it gives you the absolute pleasure and then you get addicted and you want more and more and more..This how it felt like watching it and James Cameron gave the audience more more more ...until the end.Movies must be at this level of production from now on! AVATAR have set a new Era for movies.",positive
258,"Normally i wouldn't even bother vote/comment movies. But this movies change that...I went on a date with my wife, we eat at a fine restaurant, good food, and then we went to the cinema.... We picked this movie - Avatar - we haven't heard of it before and we didn't event knew that it was the premiere evening in Denmark. It was an extreme movie experience. a more beautiful and glorious movie cant be found. It is the most intensive experience we both ever had with a movie, i can surely recommend it to everyone. And I'm hoping to see/read more about that world again. The story is good and trustworthy, and we did believe it all the way.Thanks a lot to the makers of this beautiful movie!",positive
259,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Watched it at IMAX and was blown away by the amazing audio and visual effects. The action sequences and camera work were among the best I've ever seen. I have little doubt this'll run away with just about all awards. The other contenders might as well stay home.That said, I found the storyline to be somewhat unoriginal (namely at least a couple of Japanese animated movies) and predictable. I also found that despite the length of the film, a lot of important details seem to be missing, such as the exact motivation for invading the planet (what exactly makes Unobtainium so valuable, anyway?).I also did not care for Sam Worthington as the lead character, particularly since his American accent leaves much to be desired, and I found his live-action acting to be a bit numb compared with the expressiveness of his Avatar.Worst of all, I found the ending to be somewhat abrupt compared with the amount of time spent on less important elements (oh, and did I say predictable?); practically begs for a sequel (which I wouldn't necessarily mind as long as it's written better and fills in more details).I gave it a 7 because it truly is ground-breaking cinema despite its flaws.",positive
260,"Sorry to not be with the masses on this one, but I would classify myself as being a little bit of a film buff in the sense that I've watched so many movies, even if I don't like them and know I won't, I'll still watch it out of interest. And this film actually made me LOL at my own criticisms as it was too easy to criticize. Story = humans want precious metal (or whatever), aliens occupy the area with said mineral, humans (americans actually) infiltrate in order to get, infiltrator betrays humans. uh-huh. Writing = absolutely trash, who wrote this again, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't look for his (camerons) name at the end because I can safely say it'll be the last of his films I'll watch. Honestly people, take a slight step back when watching this and you realize that he is writing for the uneducated adolescents who need stupid sentences to understand, or, hhhmm a three minute running scene to show ""how emotional it must have been for him to reuse his legs"", come on, as soon as he stood up I got it, BUT NO, 3 mins, corny heartwarming music, camera angles of his legs, then his smile, then his feet, then smile, then legs all the time with somebody shouting after him,n ""stop, you're not ready to run yet"". I mean, does this drivel really constitute as a 8.5 out of 10. Actually, I'm getting too annoyed now. Watch this film and imagine that it wasn't full of 1990's intro graphics from good PC games, imagine them as people acting, and hopefully you'll see some sense. I found one good idea in the film, that's the aliens can join up with the other animals/trees blah blah, but other than that, not one other original idea, I mean, even the female aliens, look just like the alien equivalent of human females, come on imaginations, where are you. Sorry James Cameron, I'm sorry that you made Terminator (which I find is great) and you've slowly gone downhill where you sell into the masses (who shoot in all probability, be shot) rather than trying to make a good film.",negative
261,"It's interesting and it's exotic, and so imaginatively rendered! Indeed, a cinematic thrill-ride! The film's CGI effects deliver a natural and unspoiled world to compare with a world of machines, and its digital characters are gorgeously stunning to behold! And the film does seem like one amazing futuristic action-battle razzmatazz, directed with the most uncanny computer-generated 3-D technological feat, James Cameron's epic film is, in fact, an eco-minded epic, gastulated with the most humanly issues, universally familiar ever since the colonial times. Indeed, the film's rich themes are immensely dark! Indeed, its story injects themes of colonization, imperialism, militarism, cultural differences and cross-cultural communication, and genetic engineering...all of which any misstep taken could be disastrous to peace, nature and humanity. Needless to say, this film does again echo Cameron's trademark film themes of corporate greed and the love-hate relationships with technology. Indeed, like the love between Jack and Rose in Titanic,' this love between the movie's Jake and Nevtiri, is solid that could only wither when 'death doth them part.' And in war, there will always be those who'd be willing to fight as long as it's a just war, as exemplified by Michelle Rodriquez' Trudy. James Cameron's film captures two worlds... Earth that is highly and technologically advanced and which we are familiar, and the other, a seemingly 'primitive' and physically-fit civilization of the Pandora planet, in which terrain and life remains little altered since God's generous Creation! The year is 2154, the year when modern and advanced technology has given way to the moist exclusive and unique weaponry and robotic achievements for war and science does allow avatars to be created for one human race to look like another. Wouldn't anyone be as flattered as Sam Worthington's Jake Sully to be selected to be as part of the exploration team of the exotic Na'vi world, especially when it's headed by the brilliant botanist, Sigourney Weaver' Grace. After all, their mission is for the good of human curiosity, scientific research, and knowledge! After all, Jake does understand that his twin brother had died while on the same mission, and that, he has the same genetic match of his brother to easily replace him without posing any unsuspecting lab complication. As we follow the wheel-chair bound Marine veteran in his avatar status into the Pandora planet, what is captured is so amazingly dreamlike. It's a world filled with mysticism, and in which nature thrives in absolute pure beauty and in abundance, with blue-skinned, golden-eyed, and very tall and slender beings functioning with and around nature, and complying with nature's forces... sans technology; sans machines. Indeed, an absolute contrast to Jake's own harsh world of man-created machines and scientific labs! Though the presence of Grace serves to remind Jake of his mission, it is in Pandora that Jake finds his rebirth of life.... his ability to walk and fly without constraints, a refreshingly new way to live, and he is also falling in love. And Jake does enter a world in which unimaginable creatures, like viperwolves, thanators, and banshees,roam! Oh, I do love the scenes in which Zoe Saldana's Neytiri, under the order of her mother, the Na'vi shaman Moat, teaches Jake the survival tactics of the Omaticaya people. My favorite moments are when Jake tries to control and bond with a banshee, and later, with the Direhorse! But when Jake discovers the real reasons for the interests of Center's Administrator (Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge) and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) in the Pandora planet, will he continue his mission? The Pandora planet has a rich natural resource, a rare and valuable mineral called unobtanium, deposited beneath a Hometree. Will Jake continue his scouting for Colonel Quaritch's soldiers and lead them to the mineral deposits? And will Grace and all her team members, including Jake, support the exploitations of Pandora's inhabitants? Will Jake betray his Earth people and can he be able to win Neytiri and the Na'vi people's trust? What if he goes against Selfridge and Colonel Quaritch? After all, these evil and greedy two have access to the lab that controls his avatar! What follows is our observance of the character dealing with their conscience, as Pandora continues to face attacks and destruction, both from ground and from air, as nature and people are blown to bits! The amazing CGI effects make the battle - between Earth's military-industrial forces and the oppressed, arrow-bearing inhabitants of the Pandora planet - very engaging. And Director Cameron does take his story to its climax, ultimately reminding us that nature is not a force to be reckoned. And ultimately, this film is about 'good' winning over 'evil.' Every character, human or digital, is interesting to follow, providing his or her conscience to his/her role in delivering the film's themes, And overall, the film is spectacularly mesmerizing and very enjoyable!",positive
262,"When I saw ""Avatar"" i simply waited long enough to get back to the every day reality to say anything about it. I just like to cool down instead of being carried away by the moment._____________________________________ Now, after thinking about what I saw, I can simply say it's a whole new experience. Instead of saying the story is rather simple and not so deep as some would want it to be, i will actually say it's really deep though presented in a very accessible way. The audience has to deal with enough information while stepping in a new world to also deal with a story developed in a very complex literary way. Plus, the fiber of the plot depends not so much on an intellectual level as the sensitive area of perception. Which is probably a higher step into comprehension.Mr. Cameron takes the viewer into a world so perfectly shaped and crafted, that it's impossible not to feel you are actually wondering through that land. Specially if you can see the 3D version of the movie.Besides taking you in a tour through the flora of a wild and exotic place, he also takes you into an emotional ride, full of different reactions. You can deny it as much as you want to, but you will smile, laugh, get angry and full of anguish or sorrow and joy as much as the director intended you to feel and exactly when he wanted you to feel that. It's conducted by a true expert. It's simply as it had to beTalking about the visuals it's merely nonsense, cause there are no words to describe it as well as you can experience it with your own eyes. It's simply groundbreaking and breathtaking. ""Avatar"" is setting the bar high on many levels and it's just the doorstep to what's coming next. In later years it's influence will be found in many works.In few words, my advice would be: don't let this one go. It's really the one you must see in a theater to feel surrounded by this incredibly real non-existing world. I only feel gratitude for having seen it.Anyone would.",positive
263,"Now, my judgement, my opinion of this film may be clouded as I am a big James Cameron fan. I go by Directors when it comes to many films, and it just so happens Cameron is right up there in my top 5.I've been waiting for a while to see Avatar. Friends have seen it, friends of friends have seen it, and last night, it was my turn.Stunning. I couldn't believe it. Visually, the film is a master piece. Cameron deserves the recognition I hope he will get after this film. The 3D element is, without a doubt, the best so far. You get a real sense of depth when you see this film in 3D. It actually makes Pandora (the planet where the film is set)a character of the film in itself.I was hesitant about this film when I heard you could see it in complete 3D. After seeing Superman Returns, and a few other films in 3D, I was unimpressed with 3D. The moment Avatar started, I dribbled. My eyes were being fed a visual feast that, I believe, would never be topped. The depth and feel you get from it are amazing. There were a few scenes in the forest of Pandora, at night, and the different plant life there comes alive with colour, neon blues, red, greens, you honestly do feel like you can reach out, and touch it.The story itself was good too. Though, in some ways a bit predictable, but you get sucked in and forget that and spend the next 2hrs 40 mins thinking you're there.It's the 3D element, and the visual effects that make this film. Yes, Sam Worthington and Sig Weaver add great performances, but it is the effects that made it for me. MAKE SURE YOU GO AND SEE THIS IN 3D. It'll be the best 2 hrs 40 mins you've ever spent in a cinema.....EVER.",positive
264,"People can spout how wonderful James Cameron's genius is when it comes to making huge, expensive and successful films, that isn't too hard to debate. But to say this film is original in any way is a bit of a stretch. Anyone who has watched Star Trek, Farscape, StarGate, and other sci fi films and series know that the storyline is NOT new. Granted, the special effects have come a long way from years ago and it shows in how much money and time he has put into the film. What I have to love is the fact that for all the hype and speculation for Academy nominations, everyone EXPECTED AVATAR to win. . .and it didn't. His first ex-wife won with her film about a real life subject and way under a fraction of the amount Cameron spent. The Gods have a good sense of humor to be sure. :-)",neutral
265,"From the director of ""The Terminator"" and ""True Lies"" comes ""Avatar"". Not to be confused with the hit Nickolodeon program. Avatar takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a newcomer from Earth embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home.We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where a corporate consortium is mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because Pandora's atmosphere is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human ""drivers"" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide the fate of an entire world. Avatar 10/10",neutral
266,"Just having watched the movie and its hard to come by the words to describe it. James Cameron has just set a new standard for a blockbuster. A standard which is highly unlikely to be competed with in the near future.From the moment it began to the very end was just mind blowing. Although it might take a while to get used to the 3D, the effects and the graphics were outstanding! It will be quite hard to step back down to movies we are used to seeing nowadays. It'll also be interesting to see if Cameron makes a sequel to this masterpiece. Was apparently initially intended to be a three part series...",positive
267,"My impressions after having seen 'Avatar' are mixed.On one hand I am the kind of film viewer who does not run away from entering the film theater and expecting a greater-than-life experience. I also love computer effects and any special effects that extend the cinema experience. From this point of view James Cameron's film is one of the best that I have seen, maybe second only to Peter Jackson's last film in the Lord of the Rings series in creating a whole new world of fascinating beauty, in imagining shapes, colors and visual emotions that did not exist before.I also am a big science fiction fan, I love third degree encounters, and I let easily the small or tall, green or blue aliens move and frighten me. Yet, when judging a science fiction story or film I use the same criteria as when judging any other story or film - the capacity of entertaining, of creating emotion, and of making me think. Here I think 'Avatar' is no more than an average movie. Considered beyond the visuals it is no more than a quite banal action film, with stereotype characters (human or alien), with an anti-colonial message that is routine having seen it in scores of films from the Tarzan and John Wayne movies to the latest Iraq films, and with New Age incantations that never convinced me in any film ever.The 3D genre is not so new. I have actually seen a 3D film festival in a cinematheque a decade ago, and it was made up mainly by action and science fiction films of the 50s. The technology was amazingly similar based on the two colors plastic spectacles. I find it remarkable that film makers took this technique out of the dusty drawers and made it enhance the other new film effects invented since. Films will however be judged by most people by the emotions they generate. My feelings after seeing 'Avatar' are that I viewed a fine visual show, but that it was deprived of originality and depth. Despite the 3D visuals a dimension was still missing.",neutral
268,"If anyone tells you before seeing Avatar that they were expecting a well written epic, would you think he's retarded? Probably. Our little planet waits for this sci-fi spectacle for one reason--spectacular visual effects in 3D.I just saw it in 3D in a Bangkok cinema, and I got what I had expected before. So, it's worth the price for anyone paid to see it(As you can see I gave it an 8/10). The phenomenon created by the actual viewing is almost beyond the words. Walking onto Pandora, both the audiences and Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) were awed by a very believable alien world. This is no ""Final Fantasy"", and this is definitely not a Pixar movie, it's James Cameron's visual ambition realized with 230 million dollars. As we see the complete alien ecosystem on Pandora, the lively details of every character and creature on the screen, one can't help being dragged into the world created by Cameron's team. Many scenes felt so heartfelt and thoughtful that you almost want to be a naturalist yourself. But, one can also start to build up another dimension of expectation as the incredible first act is enough to promote a well-developed mythology.You might be asking why did I wrote such a negative title. Yes, you got the idea. After my expectation was inflated, the 2nd and last act only led to one dimension of story, which was already well told in $19million-budgeted Dances with Wolves. This isn't really bad, but a minor disappointment because this outrageous similarity can take the audiences back to their reasons and minds. While watching the 2nd act which involves some tragic situations, I couldn't help but noticing the Na'vis were actually native Americans in blue skins. The 3rd act only made me notice the lack of depth in the ""civilization clash"" theme.Still, this is not saying Avatar is not a good movie. On the contrast, this review means to help you stocking less on the story side and totally immerse into the movie's visuals and logics. Concerning logics, I am already decided not to call Avatar a Sci-fi because it's more alike Star Wars. But be warned this is not Star Wars because the scale of the movie ate everything else, including performances. Though, Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles was a strong candidate for this generation's Darth Vader. Enjoy being a Na'vi!",positive
269,"This was a lousy decade for sci-fi films and I think the 00s have claimed James Cameron, the one person I was counting on to bring back the glory days of the 80s and 90s. What happened to all the Aliens, the Terminators, the RoboCops, the Abysses, the Predators, the Total Recalls, the Jurassic Parks, even The Running Mans? Muscular sci-fi action movies that wowed us with fantastic concepts and visuals while commenting on poignant truths with wit and lack of pretense?For all those triumphs, James Cameron is my personal film-making hero. Which makes the following all the harder to say: AVATAR is Cameron's weakest film to date. Which isn't to say that it's bad... but it's bad for a James Cameron movie.First, the story is unoriginal. It's ""Pocahontas"", plain and simple. The Na'vi, despite being blue and 10 feet tall, are your typical chanting, dancing, Mohawk-sporting, bow-shooting, bead-wearing, body-paint-covered, ""Earth-is-our-mother"" whooping Indians.Just pop in a DVD of the 1995 Disney cartoon and count the similarities: Intrepid male soldier who sets off to a new world in search of danger & adventure to test himself? Check. Equally adventurous daughter of the natives' Chief that secretly spies the white soldier exploring her land, befriends him and teaches him the ways of the tribe? Check. The stiff Chief-to-be appointed suitor that the native princess shuns in favor of the white guy? Check. The ensuing fight between the two and arranged execution of the white guy? Check. The white visitors' authority who only cares about money and guns, calling the natives ""savages"" and launching a final confrontation under false pretenses? Check. The native princess leading the white guy to a sacred tree to ask for advice? Check. The way she then defends the white soldier from her own people as they are about to kill him? Check. Christ, I'm surprised Neytiri didn't break out into song about teaching Jake how to paint with ""the colors of the wind"".From what I read, Cameron first wrote this story in 1995, the year the Pocahontas movie came out. Coincidence? Either way, I've seen it all before.Second, why were the characters so under-developed? Jake and Neytiri's romance feels, at points, shoehorned to forward the plot. Their first meeting: ""Why didn't you let me die?"" ""Because you have a strong heart."" Come on, Jim, I know you can do better than that. The point at which they confess their love essentially boils down to ""I choose you"" ""I choose you too"" with none of the crafted buildup that led to Jack & Rose's first kiss on the Titanic.Trudy Chacon. What is her motivation? Why is she helping our heroes? Why is she the ONLY pilot who suddenly (and awkwardly) says ""f*** it"" and turns away from blasting the Na'vi tree? Does she have friends, insecurities, family? She's just a chick there to quip lines and kick ass.The bad guys are painfully one-dimensional. Quatrich is a maniac without an ounce of humanity. Think Lieutenant Coffey from ""The Abyss"", except without the gradual slide into madness from the anger and paranoia. Coffey cried tears before setting off the nuke and that's when you realize the guy is gone... you almost feel sorry for the man before he implodes in his crippled craft. By contrast, Quatrich is a G.I. Joe that likes to blow stuff up for the fun of it. Selfridge is equally limp: just a cardboard cutout of some tie-wearing yuppie who only cares about the bottom line. Do these guys have friends? Ideals? Outside lives? Nope, they're just there as straw men in this transparent social commentary.Which brings me to: ""War on Terror"", ""pre-emptive strike"", ""shock and awe"". These are words thrown out by the baddies at the finale without anyone so much as blushing, just in case there was any doubt what half the movie's commentary is about. I'm about as anti-Bush and anti-IraqWar as you can get, and these bald-faced references made me cringe. Gone is any masterful subtlety that allows the audience to piece together their own conclusions -- let's simply hammer it into their heads instead. Even Dubya himself was less simplistic than the caricatures portrayed in this movie and this kind of straw-man commentary actually works contrary to the aims of the artist because it paints a picture of someone too evil, too simple, and too unidentifiable to be compared to any kind of actual person, thus letting the real villain off the hook.I know Cameron is a better writer than this, which is what surprised and frustrated me most of all. So what happened in those 12 years? Maybe the epic battle scenes of the new ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" movies gave him the foolish idea that anyone possibly empathizes with hundreds of faceless pawns getting shot and killed in massive battle scenes while our hero soldier and his beloved warrior princess emerge alive and victorious. Maybe he felt that ""District 9"", ""Iron Man"" and ""Transformers"" didn't amply satisfy our lust for cool CGI battle-bots sequences. Maybe his extended absence has let lesser visionaries like Peter Jackson and Michael Bay set the course for epic adventure cinema and he was merely following suit.The movie is visually stunning and another landmark achievement in effects. But the same can be said for Star Wars Episodes I - III and I don't see anyone hailing those movies as masterpieces. All in all, with AVATAR, Cameron has again become a pioneer of visual effects... but the complete opposite is true in terms of writing. He has fallen to regurgitating the tired sci-fiction/fantasy plots and concepts of this lackluster decade, forgot how to craft an organic plot and love story, and neglected to hide the marionette strings in his bold social commentary puppet show.You're still my hero, Jim. I look forward to ""Battle Angel"" with, for the first time, cautioned optimism.",positive
270,"I had high expectations going into Avatar. Now I admit, it's probably stupid to go into any movie with expectations that are too high, lest they be crushed. However, even without high expectations, Avatar impresses only on a technical level, and on that level only. The story is very predictable, and as I watched this movie I was overcome with a feeling as if I had seen this all before in something in a made for TV movie on SyFy. This is pretty bad considering this is the same guy who made The Abyss and Terminator. I can only say that if you go see this movie, expect beautiful visuals... and a standard humdrum story that you've seen before if you follow any number of science fiction TV shows or just sci-fi in general. Oh, and if this is the 22nd century, why are they still using manually propelled wheelchairs?",negative
271,This is my generations star wars! I walked out the movie theater and watched the lights come on and was completely in a daze! I cant believe that James Cameron pieced together such a great blockbuster that had heart and ground breaking VFX ...i cant wait for the sequels this winter but i had to revisit this classic and just remind myself of why i love movies. There is something about the way this movie grabs you and transfixes you into a new world! I haven't felt something that believable in ages and i now realize what it was like for the people in the 70's to see the large spaceship fly over the screen in outerspace ...i just wanted to come and review this in prep for the future sequels just well done...all around top 10.,positive
272,"I have seen the movie in 3D last night and I am really really exited. This movie was fun to watch and I enjoyed nearly every minute (161 min). The storyline is not as bad as some people say. The visual effects are ground breaking and you will flow with the 3D effects, the colors, the atmosphere. When I left the theater, I was unable to put my opinion in words, it was just awesome. The last time I was blown away by a movie like this was 1999 with ""The matrix"". Just convince yourself and ignore the complaining critics. Watch it in 3D, otherwise you will miss a lot. In the times of huge flat screen TV's, cinema is back with an experience you can not copy at home. THIS is the right answer to illegal copies. The storyline is simple, but it works great. Just do not expect a deep philosophical statement and enjoy the experience. Definitely 10 out of 10. The best movie 2009 and a lot of entertainment.",positive
273,"Over the years James Cameron's, Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it groundbreaking and a masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn't kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav'i look incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes. I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though similar to others) is like nothing I've ever seen before. 89%-A-",positive
274,"Visually, Avatar is one of the most stunning films to see. If films were based only on visual effects rather than writing, directing and acting performances, I would give a 10/10. However that would be shallow, considering as a screenwriter I know it takes more than simple beauty to be memorable.The 3D experience is quite fascinating, but ask yourself; Would you wish to see this film again? In the comfort of your own home without those 3D glasses to fool your mind's eye? James Cameron is a master of animation. Nevertheless, the dialogue is slightly too formal and simplistic, performed mainly by actors who have obviously not had experience in theatre and Shakespearean plays. Any true actor will agree, ""if you can act Shakespeare, you can act anything"".The storyline is not the example of originality, as the plot line is identical to that of 'Pocahontas'. If you do not believe this, simply compare the two plot lines. What differs 'Avatar' from 'Pocahontas' are the character names, and the era in which both stories occur. Otherwise, they are almost identical.There will most likely be angry comments on this review, since we live in a generation which is mainly judged on looks and different opinions. We simply can't accept those with views which are unlike our own.Remember, there are many films considered classics, not only for visual effects, but also for the important aspects of film which make a piece memorable. 'The Godfather', 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'Atonement' are only few examples. Years from now, 'Avatar' will be remembered as being the first 3D film to have won at the Oscars for predictably-cinematography, art direction, and visual effects. It will not be remembered as a film one could see many times over.Being mainstream doesn't make something great. Greatness is quality over dollar signs.",neutral
275,"Technically a very impressive movie with some great special effects. Whenever the people were placed in the fake world it actually looked compelling but when the not-so-convincing Navi were there it looked like CGI.The flaws in the story made this movie absurd! The guy is using a putter from today, the movie is in 3-D but the monitors of 2154 are not, we cannot drill sideways even though that is currently done all the time and for goodness sakes he calls a rock unobtanium. Too many flaws to call this a classic - it falls somewhere between True Lies and The Abyss on Cameron's list and below at least four other movies he has done! It should be seen for the visuals and that is it!",neutral
276,"The movie is simply mind blowing. Director James Cameron has sculpted this epic with his heart and mind together. The main reason why the movie is worth a watch is because the movie is complete and has all the ingredients. The movie is full of CGI. But not once do you notice that and its never irritating to the eye. The movie has a good feel for the movie-goer. With all the previews/ promos talking gadgets, I expected a Sci-Fi flick. But the movie has all emotions in it - love, vengeance, sacrifice, humor, sober, valor, pride... you name it and you have it.The plot is simple. Hence it has a greater reach. The way it is told is excellent. The movie binds the sentiments with science. The way the characters see the movie is excellently portrayed. When the scientists see, they see samples. When the power hungry humans see, they see money. When the Navis see, they see life and its simplicity. When the avatars see, they see the difference in lifestyles. And its an excellent work from the director that we see all these in the movie.Its not an edge-of-the-seat thriller but its not a sit-back-relax-watch movie either. The story is simple, the screenplay riveting and the background score simply spell-binding. What else you need for 150 minutes of entertainment? This is a visual treat one ought not miss and will be talked about for long. Its worth the wait for 11 years and I will surely wait another 11 for a Cameron movie. In the sky, if movies become stars, this movie will be the moon (I prefer it to be Pandora) to the human eye. Don't miss it.",positive
277,"Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the most well-done CGI hand in hand with the most disappointed movie of the year - yes, put your hands together for Avatar.No, no - don't get me wrong. The movie's not bad. But the script is horribly weak! I don't know if this has anything to do with the fact that I was watching a dubbed version, but the dialogues were disappointing enough. Cameron has come up with the most convincing CGI production, but, I wonder why, he only relies on the CGI? Why didn't he work more on the story and, specially the script? The direction is very slow at times, and tends to get irritating. The predictability of the movie is the worst part. We're tired of the some-stroke-of-luck last- minute-life-saving moments of the lead roles. Let them DIE man!Go watch Avatar for the deliciously sweet eye-candy, but if you're hoping for something big, then you might as well skip it.",neutral
278,"Avatar - Avatar is James Cameron's much awaited epic - the likes of which has not been seen in several years. It's great to know that something this long in the making was actually worth the wait. Jake (Sam Worthington) is a marine sent to replace his twin brother in a mission on an enemy planet. Jake is uploaded into an ""Avatar"", a genetic copy of the Na'vi the alien race he is to infiltrate. Jake's loyalties are put to the test.Avatar reinforces why certain ideas, now scathingly called cliché in the first place, are still so potent in the collective unconsciousness. The problem with so many films that tried and failed to utilize similar themes, is they have lacked the emotional maturity and depth of Avatar. The mere fact that Avatar succeeds so well indicates the truth of it's message. Is Jake going to convert? Of course he is. A relatable realistic portrayal of Jake by Sam Worthington makes us believe this. Who wouldn't want to fly? Who wouldn't want to see so much simple natural beauty and trade it in a heartbeat for their mechanized, false environment? One of the things I liked with that Jake's defection was not just for the sake of his co-star Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who is played with vitality and heart.There is great work form the ensemble. Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore all give quality work as the good guys. Stephen Lang plays the badass villain Colonel Miles Quaritch, while Giovanni Ribisi plays a scummy corporate shill.The aesthetics and scope of the film are incredible. Whether it is seen in 3-D or not the film is a work of art. The planet is gorgeous from head to toe. Its destruction is a painful reminder of the Amazon Rainforest. Some of the creatures resemble underwater creatures, whilst others bear resemblance to the conquered by nature dinosaurs. The Na'vi are a subtle mix of various conquered peoples through history. Part Indian in bone structure, part African. And who took these people by storm in the first place you ask? It is a look into the other side's shoes that Avatar provides. We haven't been the good guys for a long time guys. I love my troops for their sacrifices, but I feel that these are very much the wrong wars.The film succeeds at being preachy by diving in with it's heart on it's sleeve. The message isn't tacked on: We are the assholes when we go forth with our worst instincts for cruelty and greed. The message is strengthened by a millenia of history. The film jogs it's viewers over to the side of peace and naturalism and has them rejecting corporate greed and military strong-arming in the course of three hours. If that's not a testament to the amazing power of correctly done film than I'm not sure what is.My tiny problem is the choice of the name for the precious metal the Earthers desire so badly: unobtainium. Yeesh. C'mon guys. How about a little subtlety for audience members over the age of 12? How about ""nofindium"" or ""macguffium"". In such a well crafted film, this feels like a first draft problem everyone was too deeply involved on the project to feel like changing.Several sites indicate that two sequels are in the works. My initial response was a groan, as I thought this was a great stand-alone film that needed no further examination, but this is James Cameron the master of sequels we're talking about here. I'm sure this will bear amazing children for the years to come.2009 was a sorry year in many respects, but film was not one of them. Virtually all of the films I deeply enjoyed for using their brains, brawn and wit were financial successes. Perhaps the mass appetite/recognition for quality has not been diminished, only starved in the past few years. Maybe there is hope after all. If we're going to survive, we'll need intelligence, artistry, and ecological conscientiousness, whether we like it or not.Avatar gets an A.",positive
279,"I remember when I first saw Avatar in theatres and I was totally blown away. I remember leaving the theatre just stunned at what I had just been a part of. So I decided to go back for a second viewing and thats when it all came crashing down. Apparently the first time I was just mesmerized by the special effects to truly notice to bad acting,writing and characters.This movie is about a young crippled man who is sent on an army project to leave his human body and be put into an avatar body. His avatar body is a 8 foot tall alien and soon he makes friends with other 8 foot tall aliens.When I first saw the previews for the movie I thought it was going to be so great. But with Cameron spending all his money on special effects it lacks solid writing and actors. Frankly when I found out this is going to be a saga I was not impressed I will watch the other ones with hopes that they will improve.",neutral
280,"Everyone told me that this film was great, so i went out of my way & into the cinema ready for some great entertainment. Got a nice ice cream, got a great comfy seat up the back of the cinema and sat through the trailers ready for the much raved about Avatar experience. Put the 3d specs on & soon realized that i had better things to be doing with my time, & walked out. I handed the specs back to the cinema dude, he looked at me as if to say 'you don't like it""? I smiled a reassuring smile thinking to myself that James Cameron deserves to be hung drawn & quartered, and vowed to never trust the common public again. Sitting through this American schmaltz was too much to handle. Avoid at all costs!!",negative
281,"Just awesome. I was fortunate enough to see it in 3D, ""most of the 3D theaters were sold out"". Let me just say that Avatar is by far, hands down the best movie to come out this year and ranks in my top 15 of all time.The story is simple but effective. Cinematography is outstanding. But the special effects is just jaw dropping. The night sequences are breathtaking as the dark is illuminated by the glow of the leaves. Watching this in 3D, you cant help but look around and admire the landscape. The alien like insects, the purple sky, or how the ground lights up green when it vibrates (like m.j's Billie jean video).Avatar by far is the best movie out this year and one of the best this decade, and IS THE FUTURE of cinema. You have to see it to believe it. Its almost 3 hours long and it when it ends you would've felt it was short. I recommend seeing this in 3D to get the full experience. Either way, 2D or 3D, Avatar is Freaking Awesome.9.3/10",positive
282,"James Cameron had not directed any movie since being the ""King of the World"" after ""Titanic"" in 1998. This big movie ""Avatar"" is certainly more than an worthy comeback project to again re-launch Mr. Cameron back into filmdom's firmament.When I first saw the trailer some months ago, I admit that I was not entirely enticed to catch this film. Lately though, the film had been garnering nominations and wins for Best Picture in some year-end award giving bodies, including the Golden Globes. And finally, I was lucky enough to win two free tickets to a special invitational 3D screening tonight, so there was no question that I would watch this. And wow, I am sure glad that I did.Truth to tell, the basic story is not entirely new as we have seen it in various incarnations in so many previous movies. However, the grand imaginative vision of Mr. James Cameron is what elevated this piece into the masterpiece that it is. We are effectively transported to a whole new time (in the 22nd century) and planet (called Pandora), with plant and animal life the likes of which we have never seen before.The magical effect of 3D was put to good effect in the whole movie. From the amazingly big battle scenes to quiet scenes, the 3D drew us into this alien place as more than a mere spectator. I found it hard to imagine watching this film in regular 2D. The extra money you would pay to enjoy the 3D is very much worth it.The acting of the humans and the aliens were all very good. Clearly standing out are the good guys led by Sam Worthington (very convincing as both the crippled Marine Jake Sully and his alien Avatar) and Sigourney Weaver (as his mentor and leader of the Avatar project, Dr. Grace Augustine). On the alien side, female characters like Zoe Saldana's Neytiri and CCH Pounder's Moat stand out. The bad guys were a bit on the cardboard side, one dimensional in their wanton greed and evil machinations.This film is definitely a front-runner in the award season in the next few months. It is clearly the leader in the field of Visual Effects. Cameron reportedly conceived this project back in 1994, but only pushed through now when the technology to realize his vision had been developed, and how! We the audience are also effectively drawn into the heart that beats within the story, and get caught up in the adrenaline rush of the action along the way. This is told as only James Cameron can. Indeed, he is back!",positive
283,"Its a dazzling spectacular treat in terms of technical aspects and it takes to a world of imagination and I watched it in IMAX 3-D and its visually stunning..The action sequences are superbly created by a digital army of compositors and FX engineers - including a brigade of motion capture specialists - and the seamless visual effects render the tall, blue Na'vi entirely credible. Some of the natural wonders are blended with imaginary beauty in Pandora's astonishing forests, floating mountains, spectacular plants and tremendous trees - the latter playing a key role as spiritual guardians.The scale is extraordinary as is the bewitching world of 'Avatar' that James Cameron has created with jaw-dropping technology, stunning production design and exotic golden eyed, blue-skinned aliens whose passions are as tangible as the giant flying dragons on which they fly. This huge ambitious project which took many years in the planning earns 'Avatar'.Cameron's 'Avatar' comes in large scale, this contemporary action adventure mingled with sci fi genes & spiritual and ecological themes is more mighty & bigger as a visual epic then his previous 'Titanic'.The movie deserves a 10/10.You can't afford to miss it..",positive
284,"After seeing first trailers in cinema few months ago I was skeptical. I love James Cameron very much, his every movie is cult, and I was afraid to expect too much, although seeing the trailers I wasn't sure what to expect. Didn't want to know anything about it but in the end couldn't resist reading some opinions, both from critics and regular folks. When I first read Ebert's review I was encouraged, than after reading more and more reviews my expectations began to build up which I didn't like because of those complaints about the story.Finally last night I went to see it. Well, all fears just vanished as soon as the movie started. What can one say?! I'm still blown away I'm going to see it again tonight, but in 2D version to see the difference.Movie is so beautiful, story is so warm and sad, well, it is translation of what is happening here on Earth, fortunately we won't be able to reach other worlds before we destroy ourselves here. OK, story is not complex but why should it be? It is perfect for this movie! Some people always want some crazy twists but they aren't always necessary for movie to be great. It is very well told and you really care for the characters, it moved me to tears several times. But of course, for such cynics and nay sayers no such story is good, they just enjoy bashing, it is in their blood, so don't care too much about that.From visual stand point movie us just beyond this world, it is Pandora's world! I bow to James for such vision! To conceive this in your head and materialize it on screen is just pure art and he is Picasso of our time! Again and again he manages to create something not yet seen, he is simply the best! This movie really deserves an Oscar, at least dozen of them! I respect all the other amazing movies of the year but Avatar is just something else!",positive
285,"It takes all sorts to make a world. Some say that Cameron is a consummate writer and director. Others tell the truth. But seriously, what happens when a ten-year old child is given millions of dollars to make a movie? We get Avatar. A film so immature, condescending and so filled with plagiarism's that even though a friend lent me the DVD, so I watched it for free, I still felt robbed. Of my time. I was simply hoping that it would get better. But it did not. And what was with the music? There were so many bars of Titanic in there, I wondered if it was the same composer. Oh waitit was. And what's with the sympathy for the Na'vi? Or any indigenous people? I've no sympathy for people who use other animals to get about on or fly. Almost every so-called civilisation in the past, had slaves, practised unbelievable cruelty and preyed on the weak and those with less intelligence. The native peoples who were dominated by stronger force, as happened in America (or name your own) were no better than those who dominated them. There's no lessons that can be learnt from this waste of money and talent.",neutral
286,"Before I saw this movie I did not expect much after seeing the trailer. I knew going in to the theater that the special-effects were going to be awesome, and, oh believe me, they were. James Cameron had painted a wonderful place for the audience to watch and enjoy. A place you wish existed for real. You will get mesmerized, thats for sure.But then we come to the part that was as I expected, the story. Don't get me wrong, it was a very good story. But buy watching the trailer you knew how everything was going to end up, it was to basic. And the army guy, to much of a stereotype, it bothered me.I love a movie that makes me think, wanting more. Coming home from the theater and just longing for the DVD to come out. This movie did not do that for me, mostly because of the story.Don't get me wrong. Go and see the movie, you will love it. Just don't praise it to much cause yes its beautiful story and a wonderful world. But its not great",positive
287,"I've been waiting for Avatar for a really long time, During the long wait my expectations changes a lot, at first, I thought it would be a masterpiece on all levels, but then after the first trailer was released and all the negative attitude towards it, I became skeptical and thought maybe the long wait was for nothing, I am glad I was wrong, Avatar was truly groundbreaking and here is why:An enthralling environment is set up, with amazing attention to details, Some scenes are truly hypnotizing, Although the plot is not the most original and sort of predictable, it's still very interesting. Emotionally engaging, you care about the characters, I have never felt so much empathy towards aliens living on a distant planet, that is the genius of the movie to put you in the aliens' shoes even when they don't wear any shoes :) I don't really know what to say about the cinematography and CGI, It's bound for an Oscar, no words can describe it, you'd have to see it for yourself. Although Avatar is a little under 3 hours , it leaves you wanting more, I hope we don't have to wait so much for the sequel, and also I expect it to have a more original plot.",positive
288,"I suppose when you're trying to produce a film that pushes the boundaries of what is possible and believable in CGI, and probably spend most of your time defending a mind- boggling production budget, it's almost inevitable that you're going to take your eye off the ball on one or more aspects of the project. Sadly, this happens on the story and characterisation of Avatar, with the former well described elsewhere as generic and clichéd, and the latter as paper-thin.Visually, Avatar is without question beautifully realised, and absolutely jaw-dropping in plenty of places, but the thudding predictability of the plot combined with hokey faux mysticism and cartoon personalities often leave your mind wandering, which is never a good sign. In many ways, the film's almost undone by the realism of the CGI, since the verity of the graphics don't distract and it only serves to throw the falsity of these other aspects into such sharp relief. The dialogue also, sadly, deserves a mention in that it could have been written by a 12 year old; even the line 'Sir, I have a situation here!' makes it through the script edit. Lazy hardly begins to describe it.For all the (deserved) brouhaha surrounding Avatar, it really is pretty thin gruel indeed when compared with the efforts of Pixar, where the graphics are simply the vehicle for genuinely moving, inventive and witty storytelling.Worth seeing, but ultimately unsatisfying.",positive
289,"James Cameron, herewith referred to as JC, has done it again.Oh, how I feared that Avatar would be a cringe-worthy snooze-fest but all the reservations have been unwarranted. JC has boasted that this movie would be a game-changer and I would say that on some levels this is definitely the case. The attention to detail of the visuals and the handling of the sound, which are all perfect on all counts, make this a movie experience beyond compare. The 3D does add a little to the experience but not as much as I expected.All in all you are submersed in a world beyond description, a love story which is a little corny but heart-felt, and an experience that makes you forget your worries and woes for a few hours. That is what going to the movies is all about. Needless to say, I loved it.",positive
290,"If I described the plot of this to someone who had no idea that the movie had crazy special effects, they'd say that it sounds predictable. Well it is. It has one of the worst villains I've ever seen in a movie and every plot point is cliché and uninspired. Although if the movie had ended with the tree being destroyed and the Navi losing, I would've loved it. The Navi paralleled American Indians until the ended when they won, which ruined the whole point of making them reminiscent of Indians. If they had committed to that and given it a sad ending, the movie would've actually had a message instead of characters just constantly saying that ""we destroyed our earth"" and stuff like that. And the only the movie is the highest grossing movie ever is because it's in 3d, which adds $3 to every ticket sold.",neutral
291,"I was honestly very disappointed by Avatar, and this reaction is despite my enjoyment of the homage to Philip Jose Farmer and some other very well-executed scifi flourishes. My problem is that, as a social commentary, Avatar One was entirely misguided. I am a huge James Cameron fan, but he is at his best when telling stories, which he does quite well. So blowing up ""evil"" corporations is the way to save the world? How about looking at how it really is? These days, miners spend decades working out agreements with indigenous peoples, providing job training, repairing environmental damage, etc. Avatar is about 100 years out of date in its social commentary. In my own view of the long-term future, we will have unlimited fusion power, and raw materials will be derived primarily, perhaps entirely, through robotic recycling. So maybe we will leave the era of mining the earth entirely behind us (maybe we'll mine asteroids instead - space travel looks different when energy is virtually free). But Mr. Cameron is not telling us ANYTHING about what could make it better in future. He has no real technological imagination, and Avatar spells that out in spades. There are many brilliant failures in science fiction, and unfortunately, Avatar is yet another of them.",neutral
292,"After Titanic in 1997, many wondered how James Cameron would ever try to top that spectacle. Well, its taken 12 years, but he most certainly has, and then some.The basic plot is certainly nothing that hasn't been done before, but so what, almost any movie has a plot that's a retread of another plot before it. But what really sets this movie apart from anything I've ever seen is the amazing visuals.Seen in 3-D, the astounding special effects seem even more visceral. The hanging mountains, the mysterious and abundant creatures (some truly nasty animals that were conjured up from imagination) and even the indigenous Na'Vi tribe... all marvels of CGI.The movie is almost 3 hours long, but it's so exciting and action-packed and a delight on the senses that it's never noticeable. The acting was more than adequate, with Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldanha and Stephen Lang probably the standouts.The final battle scene is exciting and a sight to behold. And James Cameron has once again proved himself to be the ""King Of The World""!",positive

Its a movie everyone in my family, Friends have enjoyed, the storyline is predictable, but still deep enough to engage you, the environmental and culture messages can not be ignored, and are vividly weaved into the story.The possibilities of movies that will be made after Avatar, is just astonishing, well done Mr.Cameron, you've deserved the headline.",positive
294,"and been a reader of IMDb for quite some time as I am in the film industry but this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to giving my 2 cents worth as what I have witnessed in Avatar is not only a cinematic landmark but a technological benchmark as well. Previous sci-fi films made us dream of what it is like to see other worlds but this is the 1st film that succeeds literally in taking us there and is unlike no other. Star Wars was groundbreaking yes and I will always be grateful for the world it created and the unforgettable characters but surprisingly, it is more fantasy/ soap- opera than sci-fi...Avatar is actually well-grounded scientifically (go to aintitcool.com if you don't believe me as they actually got an astrophysicist to critique its scientific merits) and is as close as one can get (without buying a 1 million USD ticket to outerspace) to leaving our world and visiting another. All the haters out there simply have not seen this yet and those who were bothered by story and dialogue, I think that the brilliance IS in its simplicity- it's easily accessible by all ages and the characters speak like, guess what, you and me, the average person. I think this is the most important and relevant film of our lifetime as we are faced with serious issues that could well spell doom for our planet unless we reverse the greed over precious resources and start respecting our planet and all people of color. If there is one film I could recommend of all the films I have ever seen in the past 30 + years, this is the one. You will have not experienced anything else like it. Pandora is a character in itself. My hats off to JC for reaching for the stars and not letting naysayers keep him from realizing his dream of making this film. The CG and 3D was not used in a gimmicky way unlike all other 3D films in the past. I just saw the latest Star Trek again on DVD and it pails in comparison..I never at any point in viewing Star Trek felt I was on the deck of the Enterprise or on Vulcan with Spock. Transformers and District 9 were great popcorn entertainment but no where in scale and quality or had a potent message as Avatar. JC has figuratively invented fire or the wheel for the film industry and movie goers should rejoice that movie theaters can be relevant again if other studios follow suit and I for one am excited for this new 3D medium. Seen so much crap recently that most of it can just as easily be enjoyed at home on HD TV with a nice sound system but the Avatar experience is one that can only be fully enjoyed at the theater. Thanks JC for bringing back movie magic. Can you imagine what can now be possible with other sci-fi films, heck, all films if produced with this new technology? I can't wait.",positive
295,"I just left the movies so it's still fresh in my mind. If you are a fan of the first movie you will love this one. If you didn't see the first one, you need to see it to get a full understanding of what's happening and why. First let's get the visuals out they way, definitely top notch. But I am sure everyone knew and expected that. Thee story is great, every character is memorable. I believe the kids carry the emotional weight of the story. There were a few time I was shocked. I won't give anything away, but I can definitely tell this, there is a WAR coming. And it will be brutal. There are some lines that, once crossed, death is the only remedy.",positive
296,"James Cameron has done it again. He surely knows how to make a movie that captures the fancy of viewers of all ages and from all walks of life. While the actual story is good, its only novelty is that it is based on the distant planet Pandora, and visitors must be put into a cryo-cooled state for the long journey, then awakened upon arrival. Other than that it is a standard story of peoples from different backgrounds with an unlikely love story interwoven. Think Pilgrims and Natives, John Smith and Pocohontas, Romeo and Juliet.It is set 145 years in the future, 2154. The ""hook"" in this movie is the creation of the hybrid Avatar, which has both Earthling DNA and Pandorian DNA, so the resulting being, grown in large pods that simulate development in a womb, emerges fully grown, and is very tall and blue. But this Avatar can't function on its own, it must be controlled by its Earthling, the one whose DNA was used. The Earthling enters a special compartment, and via special electrodes is able to see through the Avatar's eyes, speak through it, run, fight, and everything else through it. But when the Earthling is disconnected the Avatar falls into a deep sleep and remains that way until the Earthling activates it again. This can be tricky!So why are they doing all this? One, to study the Pandorian race, whose atmosphere will not support Earthling life without a special breather. So the Avatar solves that problem. But there is also a rare metal, Unobtanium (I chuckled at their choice of that name!), which is desperately needed on Earth, but the richest deposits are in the ground under and around the Tree of Life where the Pandorians have made their main home. The peace-loving scientists want to gain Pandorian cooperation to have them move, but their religious connections make that unlikely. The competing group are military and their motto is, if they won't move peacefully then lest blast them out of there, let's incinerate them.The main character is a crippled man, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully. His identical twin brother was to control the Avatar Jake, but unfortunately was killed so Jake, having the same DNa, made him a match. But he had missed the special training. His love interest is the Pandorian, Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is the site scientific leader, Dr. Grace Augustine, and she has her own Avatar.The militant leader is Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch. And the commercial leader, pushing for something to be done is Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge.The animation is superb, the motion-capture technology, which was NOT part of the DVD extras, must have been exotic to enable them to make such realistic looking characters. You really forget you are looking at animation. I didn't care for the extreme fighting and military action in the last act, but overall a very good movie.SPOILERS: It looked like the militant Earthlings were going to be successful in destroying the Pandorians and their society. But Jake, getting to know them, turned his talents to help the Pandorians who ultimately prevailed. Then, at the end, a way was found where Jake would fully inhabit his Avatar, and the old Earthling Jake would die. He ended up as a Pandorian himself.Update DEC 2022: My wife and I just watched it again at home on BluRay, after 12 1/2 years. While we knew the overall story much of it was fresh after all those years. I couldn't help thinking of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 and the parallel to Earthlings invading Pandora to get valuable Unobtanium.",neutral
297,"Avatar. This is a title that will remain recognized and remembered for a long time to come. Tens of millions of people have already seen the movie and it is on track to become the highest grossing of all time. Congratulations to James Cameron for following his dream. After years of work (Cameron didn't write or direct anything meaningful since Titanic in 1997) and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, audiences- thankfully- are spellbound.The movie, set in 2154, begins with a narration by Sam Worthington and shows his character, Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, taking his deceased twin brother's place in the Avatar program, a secret mission designed to infiltrate the world of the Na'vi, a colony of blue creatures who live on the distant moon Pandora. The exploration and exploitation of Pandora is crucial to the humans as the Na'vi tribe is living on top of an enormous amount of extremely precious, and expensive, ore.Jake is not trained for this mission but since he is a genetic match to his brother, is sent anyway. His wayward actions get him into trouble relatively fast, especially since on Pandora, with his new Avatar body, he is able to run and use his legs which on Earth are paralyzed. As he is experimenting with his newfound freedom he meets the beautiful Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana, a Na'vi huntress who shows him around and introduces him to the rest of the tribe as well as their culture, language and habits. As I'm sure you can imagine, a love story ensues and Jake's loyalty shifts rather quickly from his own race to that of the blue Na'vi's.Pandora is magical. The jungle is lush and rich, teeming with life. Sights, sounds, and smells abound. There is an understanding between the people and the land, a harmony, a balance which is not exploited for profit as it is on Earth. Trees, plants, animals and the Na'vi coexist in peace and utmost respect. Trees are considered to have souls and nothing can be harmed, touched or disturbed. Each and every life, be it human, animal or plant is valued equally. This is no doubt alluring to us all, as we watch our own planet suffer from the ravages of our growth and absorb the great damages of our years of neglect.Sigourney Weaver plays a tough talking scientist, unlikeable at first (she is even shown smoking cigarettes which has caused great controversy) but her true character unfolds and is revealed throughout the movie. She has a purpose and a mission, fighting against the capitalist exploiters from Earth who are trying to ruin Pandora and expel or kill the Na'vi peoples. Stunningly beautiful moments (some of my favorites were the spectacular scenes with the flying dragons) are mixed in with scenes of utmost destruction and devastation that leave you extremely saddened and horrified at what we are capable of. I have read that some theatergoers are leaving the movie with serious depression issues, wanting to leave our world to live on a planet like Pandora.The story is simple, perhaps too simple, and themes like these have already been seen, but the movie is enchanting and the technical achievements and cinematography outstanding. The special effects are hard to put in words, they must be seen and experienced in 3D. This movie deserves a lot of the praise it is getting and is therefore a must-see. Personally I'm happy I saw it and although I wouldn't see it twice, can recognize its triumph. If it is seen as such it will be an enjoyable experience and it will be understandable why Cameron waited so long to come up with his next billion dollar blockbuster.My rating: 7 Fabio's: 6.5 Total Score: 13.5 For more reviews please visit and become a follower at: http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",positive
298,"The story and characters, the world and flora and fauna is still so present in my head. Like I never have experienced it before.Everything in this masterpiece is perfect.I support the sadly still fitting critique of humans, who come in to beautiful and self regulated eco systems and always decide to exploit and destroy it for capitalism.This movie is just a must watch and learn for everybody. How to not do things if humanity is in a similar position one day. And also what to prioritize right now, since the destruction of our necessary surroundings and the environment in general continues every day.After watching this movie i had the hope something deep in the humans will change for good. But when the picture of the orang utan, defending his jungle against a excavator, went around the world i knew there is still room for improvement, to say politely.",positive
299,"Avatar. Supposedly the best film ever made by James Cameron. I have to disagree. The film blew me away when I first turned it on with the amount of effects used. I had never seen anything like it. It has redefined movies by far with what they can now do with motion capture and blue screen. The story however was basically Pocahontas. Bad men trying to mine planet. Natives fighting back. One of bad men becomes good man. Throw in a hummingbird and a raccoon and you've got yourself Pocahontas. Surely James Cameron could of made up a brilliant storyline with some twists and turns such as the Terminator Movies or one of my favourites of his True Lies but simply taken another storyline which has been used before. However the film has its ups and down and I didn't get bored watching it. The action scenes were amazing and when the tree was blown up, that blew me away. All in all a good film but just tweaking the storyline would of completely changed my mind.",neutral
300,"I watched Avatar shortly after it first came out, and even though I was very young, I remember it being one of my favourite movies (still is today). The movies plot and setting was different to anything I'd seen before, and with the release of Way of the Water and the other Avatar movies releasing in later years, seeing so much of Pandora and the creatures and people who inhabit it is so incredible. James Cameron is an absolute master of film creation, and this movie proves that 100%. All of the actors were absolutely incredible and did an excellent job in portraying their characters, and the amount of hard work that went into this film is crystal clear.",positive
301,"Well, I just hit the halfway point of Avatar. (It came out today for rental from Netflix.) While I shan't deny the effects are outstanding, I have to say it's most derivative and manipulative move I've ever seen. Derivative because I see direct steals from Michael Mann's ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" the obvious Disney ""Pocahontas"" rip-off, ""Pathfinder,"" ""Titanic,"" and at least a dozen others. There really isn't anything original so far. Cameron even steals from himself, with Michelle Rodriguez reprising Jenette Goldstein's ""Vasquez"" part from ""Aliens"" (and why is it that the the kick-ass military chick in Cameron films is always Hispanic and has a tough but submissive male partner?); the military exoskeletons taking on the powerloader part from ""Aliens"", and of course, Sigourney Weaver playing Ripley with a PhD.It's manipulative in that everything about Pandora is beautiful and organic; while everything about the the humans is ugly and technological. One can't help but sympathize with the Smurf-elves: they're beautiful, they are one with the fauna (literally, with those built-in USB jacks in their hair), they give back to the spirit of the land, etc. The humans, however, are for the most part ugly, scarred, self-absorbed, ignorant, and pitiless, and you just know that Cameron is gonna have the big bad Earthers try to trash the pretty Smurf-elves before this movie is over. One can only surmise that the purity of the Smurf-elves will overcome, albeit abetted by the creatures of the land they are so close to spiritually.I hope something interesting happens soon, else I fear I will lose interest. In fact, I guess I already have, as I've stopped to write this...Update: I've finished the movie, and I am not too terribly surprised that I nailed it. Cameron hasn't really made an original movie since Aliens- everything has pretty much been rehashing his same tired themes over and over again. More unfortunately, the blissninnies (thank you for that great word, Col. Jeff Cooper!) all want to accept the civilization=bad, nature=good, as evinced by the misguided Global Warming alarmists.As teenage movie fodder, this sits right up there with Pearl Harbor, Titanic, Indiana Jones 4, and Transformers 2 as a movie that will make more money than anyone can believe, and still be little more than smoke and mirrors. What is sad about that is the people who love it will never realize how sad and shallow they really are...Joe",neutral
302,"Still ranking as number one, to this day, of being the movie accumulating the most revenue worldwide, approximately 2.78 billion U.S. dollar over a time span from december 2009 to may 2010, this James Cameron produced, written and directed high-end budget movie connected to audiences from any country, taking the native American story into space to a planet called Pandora, where corporates of a global-player company fight tribesmen over natural ressources. Avatar runs long and deep as audiences return for a second viewing to witness splendid, eye-popping spectacles in an intergalactic jungle favoring the color blue, close to fully animated state of the art computer-generated imagery, which deserved an Best Picture Academy Award nomination at the 82nd Oscars and marks the only second of entire three 200 million dollar movie to do so, following Titanic in 1998 and later

303,"I rewatched Avatar since I hadn't seen it since it first came out. I watched it twice when it came out and saw it in 3d which amplified my experience with it. If any film was built for 3d it's this film, but even without it I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it. A common complaint I hear about this film is that it doesn't have a story, but what about Jake Sully's story? What about Sigourney Weaver's story? Or Zoe Saldana's Neytiri?Those three characters are the story driven elements of this film, and I was invested in each one of them. People only praise this film for it's CGI or special effects, but I feel that it deserves better than that. Theme's of belonging, family and acceptance are weaved wonderfully into the narrative, as well as a strong environmental theme which some people will hate, but may fail to see the importance behind it.Avatar is an emotional journey which take's audiences to a brand new world of beauty and wonder, and for it's younger viewers, could have a range of lessons which inspire and enlighten there minds.",positive
304,"Movies like Avatar make me miss going to the theaters. Let's hope things will turn around in 2021 so the new movie can be released because I'm really looking forward to it. Avatar represents the very best of watching a movie on the big screen. Years after I watched it on the big screen I saw it on television and it didn't capture the magic at all. It felt so puny when compared to the experience in the theater. In IMAX 3D it was amazing. I still vividly remember the experience. It was like you were really there in this huge, immersive world. Cameron's movie was a mega success and deservedly so because it really did change the movie landscape. It was a marvelous technical achievement. And the story was also pretty good as it had a deeper message. A classic.",positive
305,"I have to admit that this was the One Film that I went in expecting alot. I usually don't do that, but firstly, it's a James Cameron movie, and two, it was the new tech at that time. So something had to hit home. It turned out to have good acting and a completely new setting for the story. CGI was exceptional and the story worked out. I like the end where he finally caught the predator bird - that was a lead to the finale.",positive
306,"So, I'm a big sci-fi and action type of guy with epic exposition in mind. So why did I not take a shining to this film that had all those elements and more? Why did I not warm up to it? What was it that was missing from this piece?It's kind of the same reason I didn't go see ""ID4"", and why I thought that concept of a film was pretty bad in the first place. It had no soul.So it is with Bruce Cameron's ""Avatar"", a play on the realm of computer games and online interaction, which tells the tale of a man who is likewise relegated to forever living vicariously through his blue skinned alternate persona. A comment on today's youth if I ever saw and heard one before in my life.""Avatar"" hits all the right dramatic cues. It hits all the right emotional chords for drama, plot, character, story, and even has dazzling visuals to accompany the tale of a world fraught with noble savages warring with a corporate army.I found myself laughing, loving, and even shedding tear or two as I watched this film in a packed movie theatre. And with all of the explosive action, with all of the romance and traditional underdog fighting hightech warrior themes going on, what was it that this film lacked?For all of the pro-native and pro-life messages going on here, I just found the thing to be fairly plain and unintelligent. The message of the film is sent via a telegram. It's written in big letters and nearly shoved down the throat of the audience with a huge silver spoon. Couple that with the ""muster your inner soul"" thing, and I had a hard time connecting with this film on a basic level.Oh sure, I got all the emotional stuff, and agreed with the moments of drama, but it simply was a film made for a five year old teenager. In short, it was unintelligent. When I think of classic sci-fi that I watched ages ago, I think of films that were made for adults even though they were veiled in high gloss that attracted younger viewers. That, and they had a set of precepts of what was right, and what was wrong. It wasn't a clinical analysis and twisting of basic and fundamental American values, and breakage thereof.But ""Avatar"" is made for the young ""international"" youth audience. It's designed to be a universal message attempting to appeal to everyone and everything. It's like a politician who promises a chicken in every pot, who kisses babies, shakes hands and the like, but winds up being powerless because he's promised too much to everyone, and has lost his own sense of worth. That sounds very existential, but it's essentially the problem with ""Avatar"". And it's essentially part of the reason it is not thriving like the other established sci-fi franchises out on the market. ""Avatar's"" message is that your primal instinct to mate should outweigh your other responsibilities, and that those other values that are wrapped in a colored cloth are mere jingoism and are merely clouding your judgment. The nail in the message's coffin is the corporate army is just that, a business venture run for mass murder, and for the sake of controlling and educating the natives. It's a trite message for a film that demonstrates equal regard for its target audience. And as for the 3D adding to the film? I saw the same technology demonstrated at Disneyland 25 years before with Captain EO. I can't say much has improved.Watch at your own risk.",neutral
307,"I seem to be in a minority who believes that a film's score depends on many factors. Some of which undoubtedly get 9/10. These include the obvious like special effects and direction. However, plot and imagination score poorly, as do dialogue and cliché avoidance. It's fine to take coral reefs as inspiration for an extraterrestrial jungle but it isn't new; neither are floating rocks; illuminating the ground with each step is a tribute to Michael Jackson, I get that; alien sex, which is much like ours only taller; horses with extra legs (come on!); and dragons!? Are our human minds so limited that artists have to fall back on mythical creatures? I might be judging unfairly here. Maybe we've conceived of all we are able to conceive for marketable films. Anything else just wouldn't sell.And then there's the plot. The good guys win. I've clicked on ""contains spoilers"" just in case no one knew. Okay, so maybe the question is how. And that is another of my gripes about this movie. Strength won the day. The more woolly among us may say the forces of nature or forces of good intentions did but you only have to scratch the surface of this very superficial and moralising plot to see that winning didn't happen without it. No cleverness or ingenuity, just brute force. The irony is is that this is a sanctimonious movie with an unintentionally gloomy moral.After seeing the way the majority voted (and I include my own 6/10 vote in that) I think the abiding moral for producers might be; make a movie with lots of bright colours and flashing lights and you're onto a winner.",neutral

309,"Avatar (2009)Technically dizzying, morally unambiguous, with dialog and a story line aimed at teens and young adults, but clearly with wider appeal. Set a hundred and some years in the future, the helicopters landing still conjure up Vietnam, and some of the big mean soldier stuff drinking coffee in the middle of battle, with the airships rolling in over the population below, is pure Apocalypse Now. It's a ""big"" movie, and visually demanding. The 3-D is terrific, smoother and more restrained than other 3-D releases (Journey to the Center of the Earth), which gives it sophistication beyond just the gimmick. I watched part of if without the glasses, and it's actually still pretty jazzy, so I think it would work in 2-D very well, if that's what you have in your area (or in your budget--they charge extra for the extra dimension). The music is heart pumping stuff, formulaic for sure, but part of the adrenalin machine.Is this a ""good"" movie? Not really. It's an impressive movie, obviously, but it has a hyped up computer gaming feel to it, not only visually but ethically, and in terms of depth of plot. It does have a science fiction fascination to it, with the mind and soul switching bodies in different ways, though I'm not totally sure it makes logical sense, which even sci-fi has to do. And the clichés are fun in their own ways, even if I got tired of it all the constant running and fear, the endless platitudes, the constantly pretty prettiness (it's one heck of a beautiful planet, Pandora is). Even more of a problem is the stereotyping going on, culturally, from the natives to the military, but I'll save getting angry for another day. If you notice it, it's demeaning, if you don't, watch it again.These aren't all things to hate, but the movie doesn't have a lot to love, nothing to dig into, nothing to think about, nothing to make you feel deeply. It might make you feel in a more sympathetic way--there is room for a lot of sympathy, and if your heart strings are dangling beware--but it will do so in the way the Lion King or Pocahontas did. Someone said to me, hearing my doubts, ""You expect too much."" And that makes me think, ""Really?"" I'd hate to ever say that about a movie this ambitious, even from a James Cameron who already proved his crowd pleasing intentions, and savvy, with Titanic. Expectations aside, I want more, and you might, too.I added this response to the New York Times blog, after a comment by their reviewer Manohla Dargis: Well, yes, it's sort of given that we all carry our baggage with us, and apply our viewpoints with bias, one way or the other. But Dargis is too willing to just say, ""Whatever,"" as if the movie didn't have some specific narrative and symbolic qualities that can be scrutinized. That is, even if viewers come away from the movie with a diversity of views (hopefully they do), it is still true that the main character is a white male (with a disability). Or that there are almost no African representations among the humans, and few women (two, mainly, and they both die). Or that there is a kind of broad stereotyping of the natives in attitude and appearance (widely open to interpretation, but not a blank slate). Or that the invading traitor ends up being, voila, the leader of this hapless tribal people with very high ideals. Etc. Etc. If it sounds like I'm suggesting a way to read the movie, it's not on purpose. That's the baggage thing, and I have mine. But it doesn't mean that we should all just turn a blind eye to the possibilities, without polarizing the argument, and without making the movie more than it is, a dizzying entertainment a step away from some Disney classics. With all their stereotyping.",neutral

311,"I saw a preview of Avatar last night in Glasgow and came out with the impression that I'd somehow seen this movie before. And I have. And so have you, in one guise or another.If you have an interest in movies then that shouldn't come as a surprise, and this isn't a complaint about lack of originality or clichéd plot devices (although there are arguments for both in this movie). There are after all only a finite number of themes on which to base a story.What I'm trying to say is that the entire movie felt like a re-tread of something that had come before - and not just in passing, or in specific moments, but the ENTIRE movie.There are very strong thematic similarities to movies like Dances With Wolves and Last Of The Mohicans that bob up to the surface in every Na'Vi scene (nomatter how much blue paint and exotic horse-things you disguise them with). Most of the human-orientated scenes unfold in the ""Company"" facilities that are clearly how the sets of Aliens would have looked had Cameron the budget and technology first time around, even down to the design of the VTOL craft and the power-loader battle suits.Most of the exploration and action sequences feel like levels from any xeno-based Xbox 360 or Playstation game of the last ten years. Even the strange connective tissue the Na'Vi use to link to the natural world around them feels awfully like a deliberate design for the licensed game adaptation.Maybe I'm being too cynical, but Cameron set the bar pretty high with his previous decade of movie making and I think I have a right to expect something a bit less generic.Where the movie excels is in the visual effects and the colour palette - I watched the preview in 3D and was really really impressed. There's nothing like it in terms of CG rendering and seamless motion capture. Avatar represents the next step up in cinematic effects, in the same way that Weta Digital showed the world how to do it with the animation of Gollum in The Two Towers.Weighing in at the best part of three hours, it felt like longer (something I never thought I'd say about a sci-fi movie) and could probably have used a few judicial cuts. There was just a touch of Tarantinism about it - i.e. self-indulgent and over-confident.Overall, I did enjoy this movie and when you watch it yourself (if you haven't already), I'm sure you'll enjoy it too.Despite all the incredible visuals, alien worlds, exotic flora and fauna and so forth, it's the strangest thing that I should leave the cinema wondering why it felt so unoriginal.",positive
312,"As soon as i watched this movie back then when i was a young boy,i was completely amazed by it the visuals,the amazing pandora and the storyline of it.James Cameron takes us on an adventurous journey into the world of Pandora and it is stunning.More than ten years later,it never ceases to amaze.",positive
313,"This movie definitely feels ahead of its time. If you're here to check if it's worth watching, then don't waste time, just go for it.The story and direction is so perfect and the animations, visual effects and cinematography seems like impossible to make back in 2009 but don't know how they've made it possible.Many movies produced in 2022 not have such good animation, visual effects, such good cinematography and most importantly the story.I was in 9th class when this movie got released and after 3 years in 2011 I got to watch this movie and I got very impressed by it.Today on 13-12-2022 I again watched ""Avatar 2009"" and this time I was able to relate to the characters in more depth, I was able to understand them more, I think this is because I have grown up, I can understand the pain, the efforts, I know the value of sacrifice, trust & loyalty.Well from now on, after 3 days, its sequel ""Avatar: The way of water"" is releasing & I can't wait to go into theatre to watch it, I have already pre-booked the tickets.This movie teaches you a lot of things, you should be good enough to understand them.",positive

315,"We all know that the story of Avatar is replaceable and has been dealt with in Hollywood for decades before (-> Dances With Wolves). But honestly, if you watch Avatar and only care about the story, you're kind of missing the whole point of the movie.Pandora, along with Middle Earth, is one of the most immersive worlds that have been brought to cinema screens in the 21st century. I would argue that Middle Earth is holding the number one spot here, but keep in mind that LOTR's world existed before in books whereas Pandora was built from scratch for the movie. To develop the appearance of the Na'vi species, the other creatures and animals, that is a big achievement. The terrain and environment is just beautiful to look at. 
At the end of the day, Avatar's visual experience can hardly even be compared to anything that came before or afterwards in movies. Even in 2018, the immensely detailed particle effects when the wind of turning rotor blades rushes through the vegetation just blows my mind.
And even though 3D wasn't really a lasting success, that is what made Avatar unforgettable. People watched it because of the 3D effects (I still think that this is why it has become the highest-grossing movie) and in no other movie was it so fitting.
Ultimately, Avatar is one of the best blockbuster movies of all time, period.
The story, well, is not too bright but not too important either. The visuals kind of made me forget about the story because I was too busy being fascninated by Pandora itself. I felt thoroughly entertained.",positive
316,"A game changer visually. This is by far the most visually pleasing movie experience of my life. From a technical point of view, this movie is perfect. However, a story cannot be carried by visual imagery alone, and aside from the visual, there are aspects of the story that are fussy at best. It's quite clear that the movie is trying to deliver a message, but at the same time I believe there are moral issues that get pushed aside and remain unanswered.There's no question that there is darkness to be found in humanity, but is there no hope? It seems that goodness was only to be found in our human heroes when they parted with their human origin. An origin the main character eventually left behind entirely, both physically and emotionally. When the humans began to destroy the home of the Na'vi, there wasn't much mercy to be found in the heart of our hero. They never even got a warning before our heroes began slaughtering them. What was the message here? I find that the movie painted a very black and white picture of the moral dilemmas humans are faced with. In this story, violence and death was both the problem and the solution.",neutral
317,"Like the original 1977 ""Star Wars,"" this film at last raises the bar in terms of crafting a breathtakingly beautiful and mesmerizing alien world and its creatures. I predict there will be several copycat films that try to cash in on the Avatar ""look,"" and the film certainly will have a cult following. Though the movie is over two hours long, it presents such a rich tapestry and lively pace it flows by quickly. The film is so visually overwhelming that the storyline became secondary to me. No other sci-fi film in memory has so convincingly woven together and entire alien biosphere and pre-technological civilization. When I saw the blue ""Smurfs-on- steroid"" aliens in the trailers, I was afraid this would be a sappy tale. It is anything but. Many elements from Cameron's earlier films are obvious. Sigourney Weaver looks and acts like she just shipped out after her adventure in the movie ""Aliens."" The bioluminescent creatures of the moon Pandora are reminiscent of the aliens in ""The Abyss."" The fighter ships come straight from ""Terminator."" Cameron also heavily borrows designs from the ""Dinotopia"" fantasy book series.What I do find tiring is the heavy-handed environmentalism message that seems a prerequisite for otherworld fantasy films today. There is even a veiled allusion to the Bible's Tree of Life. Apparently the moon Pandora is a living Garden of Eden. That is, until those greedy, warlike, and arrogant humans come along. This is where the story gets weak and horribly contrived. The moon has some magnetic superconducting element not found anywhere else in the galaxy. And, the natives of Pandora just happen to be living on top of it. Talk about location, location, location.Never mind that the universe is collectively made of exactly the same bricks and mortar found in the periodic table of the elements. Or, that transporting an exotic element to Earth across interstellar space would be ridiculously expensive. It would be vastly cheaper to synthesize it on Earth.The film draws obvious parallels to the decimation of Native Americans by the New World colonists. The military bad guy's are straight out of Cameron's ""The Abyss."" Apparently humans are so evil they not only would strip mine a planet but also decimate its inhabitants. In reality our scientists would always have the upper hand in such a discovery simply because Pandorans don't vote for Congressmen. A moon like this would be just an astrobiology curiosity. It's totally implausible that any private corporation would have the resources to mount an interstellar gold rush.These story shortcomings aside, ""Avatar"" is still a powerfully engaging and memorable film. It's a long-awaited break from much less imaginative and utterly moronic story lines in most contemporary sci-fi films, such as ""District 9"" and ""2012.""",positive

319,"OK, so I walked in to movie theater excited for what most have claimed to be an awesome movie. I walk out, however, brooding over certain aspects of the movie that made it terrible. For instance, the idea is that of Pocahontas, The last Samurai, and HUNDREDS of other movies and stories already out there. Beyond lacking originality, the screenplay sucked. Character development was even worse in this movie, as EVERY SINGLE character in this movie is flat,not a single one qualifies as a round character. Many parts of the movie were corny, some of the supernatural aspects were really lame and stupid, and overall the movie had the inability to move or effect the viewer. i must admit the CGI was cool, but otherwise, this was a failure.",negative
320,"Avatar is truly a one of a kind movie, one that everyone should see. If you have an IMAX 3D theater near you, see it in 3D. The effects are astounding. You are really able to enjoy James Cameron's vision. After the movie I almost felt like I had visited an alien planet and returned back from it. Incredible visuals. The Na'vi people are beautiful and fascinating. They have amazingly expressive faces and eyes.I think that the best thing about this movie is that it forces us to look at ourselves as a race. What kinds of behaviors and personalities do we reward and condone. A lot of people are saying that the characters are very simple and archetypal. We have the hardened war colonel, the greedy corporate suit, the anti-military scientist, etc. In my opinion the characters are made this way for a reason. Every character is the prototype of what is expected of them. In the US and many other countries on Earth we consider the perfect military colonel as being loyal without limits, able to shut off their feeling and emotions and get the job done. Basically to have no real sense of morality besides that of getting their country what they need and want. Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is everything a person would be if he were able to fully become our societal archetype of a perfect military commander. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) is everything that makes up the successful businessman prototype, greedy without thought to anything else. Totally goal oriented. These two have become exactly what their society wanted them to be, and when they did they became monsters.One the other hand we have Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and co. Scientists who sympathize with the Na'vi and are against use of military action on Pandora and towards the Na'vi. However they are unable to really do anything useful to help the natives, especially since their whole operation is funded by Selfridge and whatever corporation he works for. Their promises and actions ring hollow.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is the blank slate of the movie, he is like a child. He gets to see the extremes that have become of the humans and offset that with the way the Na'vi are. Under the guidance of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) he learns the ways of the native people of Pandora. The Na'vi kill and fight, yet they do so only for a purpose and usually with sadness. They have warriors and spiritual leaders and look at their environment and nature as their mother and constant companion. They are in touch with everything around them to an unthinkable degree. This movie is really all about him choosing which way of life he thinks is worth fighting for. And of course the fight that comes after that decision.This is one of those movies that comes along once in while. It's unforgettable and though the dialog might need a little work, Avatar delivers solid entertainment. Well worth the money to see it in a theater.",positive
321,"James Cameron has made the most fun, exhilarating thriller movie of the year. I came into the theater, remembering the critics praise and the buzz of everyone saying that the movie was awesome. So I had high expectations, but I mean really really high. Even with such high expectation, the movie manage to exceed them.The plot is simple. But in a way its organized and crafted superbly, you are guaranteed to have fun. Yes its a little bit obvious but do not let it take you down, because there's more to the movie.Great acting for everybody. Very convincing and very realistic. And very well directed by James Cameron.The object that attracts you most to the film it's the beautiful CGI effects. The trees, the creatures, the scenery, its all just perfect. The way to synchronize reality with the effects it's just awesome.As the film progresses, you start to get into it. By just watching it, you feel that the story grows into you. You start to become part of the film.The film is a fun-filled ride. Truly exciting and magical. The movie is an instant classic, worthy of many Oscars. This one goes on my top movie list as #1.I wish I could give it more than 10 it deserves all the praise the movie is getting. For once I can agree with the critics.",positive
322,"James Cameron's latest attempt, Avatar, is no longer an attempt. Avatar is the most visually beautiful film I have seen in the past ten years. It is a stroke of utter and complete genius. James Cameron brings to life an entirely new way to create a world. With only 40% of live-action material, Cameron created a world so renown and so stunning that for over 2 and 1/2 hours our eyes are glued to the screen. Cameron has a way of allowing you to be awed by the beautiful world that is Pandora while still paying close attention to what's right in front of you. The visuals do not take away from the movie in any way. Everything is superb from start to finish. Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Joel Moore, and everyone else are excellent in their respective roles. I've read some of these comments on here and can't fathom why people do not like this movie. Yes, the movie drags on a bit, but if the movie were only 2 hours long, people would complain that there was no character development or some parts were left unfinished. James Cameron takes you through Jake Sully's transformation in such a way that you actually believe in your own mind that you were watching a human being turn into something completely different, all while not missing a beat.You don't have to like or dislike any of Cameron's other films in order to decide whether or not you want to see this movie. This is a masterpiece from start to finish, in every aspect of the movie. The fact that this has an 8.8 is superb but only #25 on the Top 250 is beyond me. The Dark Knight was a great movie but it does not deserve to be #9 with Bale's shotty performance (as usual).Avatar may simply be one of the most artistic movies ever made, and I mean this with no exaggeration. Undoubtedly the most beautiful film I've seen since The Green Mile. Granted I've only seen The Green Mile for the first time last week, but going back to 1999, I can't think of any better movies.Avatar ranks up their with the best, and it deserves to win every award that it is nominated for. Simply put, a stunning 10 out of 10.",positive
323,"In my opinion this movie is the best movie of the decade. Personally, it launched itself into my own personal top 5 of all time...maybe even number 1 after I reflect more on my experience. The movie is a magical experience. You will hear ""critics"" bash the plot as something that has already been done and/or reminds us of about 5 different movies in one. However, I reject these critics analysis because what movie can't you say that about? I once heard there are only around 56 stories in existence, and they keep being retold over and over again in different varieties and with different characters. So the fact that the story is one that is common to us (i.e. an outsider realizes that his own people are the evil and takes sides with aliens to vanquish his own, e.g. Dances with Wolves) doesn't bother me. I think the writing is excellent, the dialog superb, the special effects mind-blowingly amazing, and the story emotionally uplifting (i.e. it may bring a tear to your eye and force you to look at your fellow man a little differently regardless of the color of their skin or gender). To me this experience was beautiful and will be with me for a long time. I suggest this movie to EVERYONE, in IMAX 3D if possible.",positive

325,"First of all, I did not regret to have seen this movie. I loved the colors and visual effects. But it is all too much. It lacks any subtlety. In every corner of the movie there are effects. It gives me the same feeling as the Starwar movies. It is all too much a computer game, no rest no time to breath. I think it is beautiful in the light of the zap-culture. The only thing that grabbed me were the visual effects. But one and a half hour should have been enough for me. I can imagine that for instance that the movies Solaris , I am legend, 2001 a space odyssey, planet of the apes in 3D have more effect to me. They contain a story-line and some mystery",positive

327,"This film is very, very pretty. But that doesn't exactly make it a 'transcendental experience'. You can get pretty things by staring at the iTunes visualisations. My main gripe with this film is the characters and the story. The characters are relatively empty placeholders, except maybe Sigourney Weaver's character. The story...Oh boy. There are no surprises here. Everything you think will happen, pretty much does. Everything you've seen in about, twelve other films, you'll see here. So, if you don't mind recycled storytelling and want to see some pretty colours flash around for two and a half hours - go nuts. If you want original storytelling, compelling characters and inventive dialogue, see something else (like Brick, 2005).",neutral

You can balk at that, but do not let the robust visuals and ""experience"" factor take you away from my point. You boil away the visuals and you have a markedly less interesting story.Having said all that, this film was obviously well worth it, on the basis that it will bring minions of children and young adults joy, the world over. It is an impacting film that lingers, visually, in the memory.

But Avatar is so much more than a sci-fi movie; it's a total new experience. 3D adds a great deal to the movie but it's such a complete movie that it wouldn't be effected that much even it weren't shot in 3D. It has emotion, originality in the making and the world it presents, action, story line and acting, too. Please go see it (probably more than once). You won't regret it.",positive
337,"If only this movie had a better story to tell. Avatar by James Cameron is a visually stunning film with some really great CGI, and the world of Pandora is engrossing but the story is so pedestrian that it makes it difficult to watch the movie 2 plus hours.The basic story is one of a disabled veteran Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) who takes over his brothers role of a Nivi (the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora). Colonel Miles Quaritch(Stephen Lang) uses Jake as a spy to gather information about the Nivi. Well Jake is found by Neytiri(Zoe Saldana) and she will become his teacher in the way of the Nivi and they also fall in love, Jake goes native and it becomes the colonel's task to destroy the Nivi to help some greedy earth corporation. The problem is that besides Jake and Neytiri all the other characters are sock one dimensional cartoon types particularly the evil corporate manager and the colonel. The story is rehash of several others and the environmental message is played way to much with a heavy hand. Am I the only one but the floating mountains seem to be a rip off of Roger Deans album covers from the 70's I thought I was looking at my old vinyl copy of Yes Songs. I was expecting to hear Close to the Edge at any moment.Grade C+",neutral

He tries to show us that we need to be more tolerant, patient, curious and kind. And that we need to look after one and other and the environment which surrounds us. There is no plan B.

The writing is pretty poor, as many of the lines in the movie come out to be corny. Even though the story has been done over and over again and the writing isn't great, the movie is visually stunning. James Cameron has created something we have never seen before in a film. Sadly, that's all Avatar is; eye candy. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good moving story. So instead, go watch Dances With Wolves, trust me, it is similar and far more worth while than this. But if you enjoy action packed CGI filled movies, then this is the one for you.And seriously? Unobtanium?",positive
340,"Avatar is an awful movie.Avatar isn't 'mind numbing' - that is the wrong expression. It's exasperatingly, walk-out predictable. It's the same feeling you get watching a nice-looking person you just KNOW is going to do something stupid. Again and again. We have all done that, and after watching for a while you just despair and walk away ..But a review should be constructive. So I have had a think and have worked out what could have saved Avatar from all the bad reviews. The hero of Avatar, played by Sam Worthington, should have been played by Stephen Hawking.Now THAT would have been a movie, won some worthwhile Oscars and made everyone who sees it happy.Ideas like these don't come cheap, and this one is too late so it's free. But I suggest - if you are making a movie - you contact me BEFORE the casting and the script is finished. You never know what a director's Oscar could do for your career ..",negative
341,"Let me start this off with a few words on originality in film. I like to judge movies on a purely subjective level, so the originality of a plot or idea is is only relevant to me insofar as it begets predictability. So, while I criticize Avatar for being an extremely predictable film, I don't consider its supposed lack of originality, probably its most universally criticized aspect, to be relevant. Cross-medium adaptations don't catch any flak because they acknowledge their intent to re-film the same plot. Instead they are judged on how well they are able to capitalize on the storytelling strengths of the new medium while retelling said plot. No Country For Old Men is a perfect example of this. And I'm telling you that Avatar is an example of this as well. The 3D film is used so well in this film, it transcends ""gimmick"" status and becomes an amazing tool of immersion. It sounds like a studio-issued tag-line, but really, you have not experienced a film the way that you experience this one in 3D, on a large screen. You have seen this story before, but with Avatar you really feel like you are experiencing it through a whole new medium.Okay, that was more than a few words. Sorry. Here is my actual review:There are two things that this film does so well that its flaws are completely overshadowed (flaws such as frequently weak dialogue, a handful of cheese, predictable plot, lack of secondary character development).First, it shows Jake Sully's gradual immersion into Pandora and Na'vi culture, and brings us along for the ride. His character arc is sublimely executed, and the world in which it occurs is mind-blowingly cool and fully realized (It is also worth noting that the love story is almost embarrassingly sincere, which I consider to be a plus, but can be kind of awkward to watch with friends). By the end of the film you will feel like you yourself have spent time living among the Na'vi on Pandora, and it is a truly intoxicating experience (I want to fly around on a dragon too, damn it). Leaving the theater, I had the feeling that you get after waking up from a very pleasant dream: genuinely disappointed that it isn't real, but still high from the experience.Seriously, I would kill for either: A: a zombie apocalypse; B: a trip to Pandora Second, it sets up and executes the mother of all action sequences. The film gradually builds tension over its 160 min. running time, contrasting Jake's love for his newfound life with escalating displays of imperialist douchebaggery culminating in a couple of tragedies that really hit you where it hurts. I already knew exactly how the final battle would turn out, but god damn did I want to see it happen. Now, some people view any kind of action scene as a flaw for reasons I cannot fathom, but as an action movie aficionado, my eyes honestly welled up at the absolute magnitude of spectacle that I was witnessing. Maybe it was the IMAX, and maybe it was the 3D, but this movie had absolutely the greatest climactic action scene I have ever seen. I mean, better than the hospital sequence in Hard Boiled or the church scene in The Killer, better than anything in the Matrix trilogy, better than the last 20 minutes of Raiders of Wu-tang or the last 10 minutes of The Mystery of Chessboxing, better than any of Cameron's previous action scenes, and certainly better than any of Michael Bay's incoherently edited crap.Avatar is a remarkably focused, entertaining, and well-paced epic. Never have I seen a film of this length that felt so short. There Will Be Blood, probably my favorite film of the decade, is about the same length but feels twice as long. Not once during the running time of this film was I bored. Yes, the film has a few flaws that would be enough to cripple a lesser film, but in the face of what this film achieves, they seem negligible. This is not a film that tries to impress you through its plot; it focuses entirely on visceral entertainment. Aside from the initial exposition, any time that is not spent on some sort of immersing spectacle is spent setting up some sort of immersing spectacle, and yet it never feels like empty entertainment; we are always emotionally attached to the characters and events. Avatar is a remarkable achievement and sets a new benchmark for blockbusters that I fear not many will be able to meet.I give it a 9.5 out of 10, but I think it deserves a 10 more than it deserves a 9.",positive
342,"Initially conceived in 1999 as Cameron's follow up to Titanic, Avatar was put on hold when Cameron realized the technology did not exist yet to support his vision. Over the course of the next decade, Cameron created much of the technology he needed to make this movie possible. In 2002, Cameron watched The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and through the character of Gollum realized that his vision was finally possible. Twelve years have passed since the release of James Cameron's Titanic, will his new film prove that Cameron is still ""King of the World""? Much has been made of Cameron's Avatar long before it's release. Hailed as a revolution in 3D and CGI technology, Avatar holds a lot of expectations, not the least of which is the fact that the budget and marketing for this film add up to approximately half a billion dollars, making it the most expensive movie ever made. Of course, Cameron has been here before. Titanic cost $200 million to make, the largest budget for a feature film at the time, and just when it looked like it was going to goose that laid the rotten egg it proceeded to make $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time. Cameron's also not new to the idea of revolutionizing the world of film with almost every movie he makes: with The Abyss he had the first all digital water effect, with Terminator 2 he had the first CGI character with realistic movement, and so on. Can lightning strike yet again? I'm generally someone who's adverse to using all caps for anything, but: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE!!!!! Also don't wait for it to come to DVD or to a TV station near you. Why, you ask? Because this movie is a movie that has to be seen the way it was intended to truly get the fully immersive experience. I watched the trailers on TV and online, and none of that compared to seeing the film in theaters in 3D. With Avatar, Cameron has truly outdone himself. When District 9 came out, I raved about the CGI effects in that movie, but Avatar is a whole other monster. With Avatar you truly cannot tell where the CGI begins and reality ends and vice versa, and on top of that it is the most beautiful film I've ever seen, CGI or otherwise. On top of that, Cameron's new 3D cameras create an experience that is in no way uncomfortable. No headaches and no motion sickness for those of you who suffer from that sort of thing. Instead, you get a highly immersive experience that leaves you begging for more (which is saying something, considering the film's run time is 162 minutes) and wanting to return when you leave.I've seen a lot of reviews lately that talk about the film having a weak script with too many clichés and one dimensional characters. What you really get, in my opinion though, is old school story telling with a message, even though the message is drowned out in special effects and action. The script moves quickly, there is no downtime, but you also never feel like the pacing is off, or that it's moving too fast. Cameron has built a complete world, we don't just see characters and action, but we see complete eco systems, and are introduced to many characters. While the entire cast is amazing, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch are the real standouts here. Sam Worthington creates a character that you feel for, and through his progress from pawn to leader is truly believable and heartfelt. Stephen Lang, on the other hand, gives us a character that starts off just trying to do his duty, but eventually becomes a character on par with Sergeant Barnes from Platoon or Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.I purposefully chose not to mention anything about the plot for this movie. I think this movie is going to be the revolution of movies that Cameron believes it's going to be. I've seen reviewers compare it to The Wizard of Oz (the movie to truly lead the color revolution) and King Kong (the 1933 version, which revolutionized special effects), and I wholeheartedly agree. I still can't completely fathom what I just saw, and will probably see it at least one more time on the big screen if not more. Anyone who's into film, the tech of film, or just wants to keep up with where film is going in the future should see this film. On top of that, this movie touches on so many different genres (SciFi, fantasy, romance, war films, drama, etc.) that it will appeal to almost everyone. Once again, James Cameron is ""King of the World""! 5/5",positive
343,"James Cameron's new movie ""Avatar"" is an outstanding film.Each and every actor gave a solid performance that helped to enhance the film. Stephan Lang was absolutely brilliant in his role. The characterization was wonderful and the writing allowed you to identify with the characters and empathize with them. It is rare that a Sci-Fi movie has this range and depth of characterization included.The story is the usual Sci-Fi/Fantasy story. Nothing in the main plot is much different from other movies that have tackled the same dilemmas.The world is an absolute utopia for the senses. There has never been a movie with this much detail and fantastic effects with the landscape. Every plant, every stream, every inch of this planet is stunning and wonderfully filmed. The floating islands are stunning, the foliage, the life that the illumination brings to the plants, the colors, this world is beautiful in every aspect.The indigenous life looks real and the creatures also have great character and essence.Digital 3-D is a must to get the full experience. The 3-D makes you feel like you are looking out your window (or doorway) into this world. You see the insects flying around the characters and you feel like you could catch one of the fireflies, you feel the embers of the fire nearing you, you experience the depth perception of entering a room and looking at the characters within.Avatar is a masterpiece in film-making. While the story is typical of Sci-Fi alien encounter movies and the acting is very good---the world is stunning, visually moving, a complete enjoyment for the senses, a visual fantasy and delight, an experience well worth any admission price. Avatar is the greatest visual/special effects movie ever made. I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. Sit back, take in the beauty of the environment, the thrill of the 3-D and the excitement of experiencing flight, riding, and fighting in 3-D.WOW is the word you will use over and over and over throughout this entire movie.Reading some of the other reviews, I am saddened by the nasty commentary that people have put in these forums. It is obviously not accurate about the film and made to discredit a visual utopia. Please do not listen to negative people. Whether you like the story or not---the visual are so amazing that you are engulfed in the beauty of the planet and it's life force. What Cameron has done is to elevate the level of film-making for the coming years and I applaud him for his efforts. Relax, take a deep breath and sit back and enjoy the spectacle.",positive
344,"This is only my second review on IMDb after my all-time favourite 'The Matrix'. So, it is quite obvious that I am a sucker for sci-fi.Yet, I deducted one star for the lack of originality in the character and story departments. Full marks for the creation of a fictitious parallel world. I bow down to the technical team of this marvellous piece of art. Money well spent by the producers.In the acting department, everyone did a fine job considering the transfer of the true human expressions on a graphic platform. (Again, of course, with the aid of the technical team.) The direction was fabulous, aided by some excellent editing, cinematography, sound and not to mention SFX.This could easily be a wonderful tribute to the works of the many unknown entities who make an eye-opener of our movie-going experience.Finally, I'd like to mention that I fell in love(genuinely) with Neytiri. For me, the tall, wild, blue, computer-generated damsel outshines all other cinematic goddesses. (Again, thanks to the technical brilliance behind 'Avatar'.) I'd be looking forward to an IMAX viewing as well as buying a Blu-ray player just for an 'Avatar' disc.",positive
345,"**** CONTAINS SPOILERS******* I'd like my 3D with less cheese please Mr Cameron! I walked out of the theater with the same bitter feeling as when I saw the Star Wars prequel whatever it was called the Phantom something. The feeling of having witnessed a complete failure I wanted so badly to enjoy. It all starts with that cheesy voice over. Usually a bad sign, but I was crossing my fingers the guy is a maestro, a genius, a pure talent, after all I heard in the media. 20 minutes of miserable acting and unbelievably lame lines that belong to a B TV series later, I start doubting the reviews. Characters who are supposed to have been living together for months start explaining to each other why they are here, who they are etc... in a very contrived and unsophisticated way that make it all very laughable. The hero is played by a bloke who belongs to an afternoon TV series, and is described as a stupid marine. Impossible to even start liking him. I started asking myself whether the genius had made a comedy. But no, the rest of the picture was undoubtedly first degree cheese. We were not supposed to laugh. Then this big animal a giant black alien panther with 6 legs comes out of the jungle for a chase, I cheer up: the masterpiece starts here! A cool chase in the woods, our hero is separated from his patrol without means of communication and runs for his life in the jungle. His patrol leaves him behind. There is nothing they can do. The hero miraculously escapes by jumping in a waterfall. You'd think that his fellow soldiers would deem him dead after leaving him alone to deal with a giant panther in the middle of a an unknown jungle. No. The officer as if he had seen the movie fears: ""he won't make it through the night"". That's when I started thinking that there was something deeply rotten in Avatar: the script. It feels it has been written in a rush or by a talentless beginner, or someone whose power in the project was such that nobody would dare tell him the blinding truth: if you are over 12 years old, you cannot believe one minute of Avatar because it's too cheesy. The script is not at par with the budget, nor the CGI . The fact that it makes so much money at the box will certainly make the author(s) brush any criticism away. Regardless of the box, avatar is a scandal of a script. Then the rest of the movie is just a confirmation that what makes a bad movie is a bad story. It becomes an endless retelling of Dances with wolves, itself a cheesy retelling of Little big man etc. As usual it needs a white man to tell the Indians how to fight back, they're too under-developed, naive and primitive you see. With a few differences: the Indians are now the color the soldiers of the cavalry used to be, ie blue, they have rastafari dreadlocks, cats eyes and mouse ears and they are saved not only by Kevin Costner but also by the buffalos this time. The Buffalos join forces as they have learned their lesson: they understand what Buffalo Bill will do to them later on if they don't do anything. Many similarities still with your usual John Wayne western: the horses, the broncos they tame, the arrows the costumes and the squaws. But no Wayne. No actors at all. Our tasteless hero is accepted by the Indians, God only knows why, no explanation is given, except their sheer stupidity and he is taught how to become an Indian himself through a 30 minutes montage of boring sequences with no dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is the usual celebration of testosterone and violence, the usual Hollywood dubious self-defense violence you find in any action movies except this one is lecturing us on its anti violence anti war stance. It still exploits an hour of pure violence to make money. End of story: the usual showdown between our dummy boy hero and the baddie, a ridiculous body builder GI Joe. A movie is as good as its baddie, Disney used to say . Well look at the baddie here: you'll know how bad Avatar is. The hero saves the Indians who without him would be toast, they're so crass and stupid, those ""savages"", a stupid marine makes all the difference. I watched all this mess with a pair of heavy 3D glasses which darken the picture and leave a mark on your nose so everybody you meet within the next two hours ask you whether you've just seen avatar, it's so red in the middle of your face. They say it's 21st century cinema. It may well be, but when the novelty of the technique wears off, they'd better start hiring scriptwriters. I am not going back any time soon. I don't care about the 3D, I want to see a good movie please! The quality of the dialogs and the fun of the Ice Age or Nemo make those cartoons enjoyable for all. Avatar is only for kids who enjoy violent video games and do not care for any story or characters. I heard people say Avatar is beautiful. Avatar's conception of beauty is ""when it glows in the dark"". Like stars you stick on kids bedrooms ceilings. I'm way too old for fluorescent deco. There is good news in Avatar's box office: it is probably scaring the hell out of LA talent agencies who got used to making millions off star power. People seem happy with 3D without cast. It may be the only 21st century news in the picture.",neutral
346,"This review contains NO spoilers and I did not see any trailer footage beforehand.Ever went to a fun park where you wanted to take the biggest ride? Well, in this case it is Avatar. It is the mother of popcorn that ends all popcorn movies. Literally really. But as with any popcorn movie, you should keep your expectations low story wise and then you will have a great time. Especially with teenage kids. Else get ready for some serious eye-rolling and groans.And here's why...SCRIPT: Man, what can I say? They say, Cameron has been working on this thing for years, wanting to recreate an detailed fictional world full of life, vistas, sounds, colours and spirit. So you might think he would have had time to develop the story as well. I don't know why it turned out to be so juvenile in the end; it really does not exceed the storyline of a Saturday morning cartoon show. The characters are very one dimensional while the opportunities of exploring the characters more are so interesting and wide open. You cannot say anything, unfortunately, then that the characters serve nothing else but the cgi.I think this can only be one of two reasons; OR James Cameron has the mental age of a 14 year old, which I doubt because it is takes enormous effort and organization to set something like this up. OR is aiming for such a wide audience that it also covers the Asian market. I am going for the latter, which uncomfortably fits Cameron's commercial aptitude towards movies.EFFECTS But while you are waiting for the predictable plot to unfold you will be shown a beautiful world with interesting creatures. And this is were certainly the element of Asian influences shows. Although the world looks luscious and full of life, it still cannot escape the CGI look it has. It still moves too elegant or fluid to be lifelike. The irony is, that this becomes quite apparent in the cinema 3D version. The 3D does not actually add much to my opinion, although once I was fooled into believing something small was in front of my face, the cliché of actual pointing or throwing things at the camera confirms the 3d but here it is done so subtle you forgot about it. And when it is apparent it is still not that relaxing looking at it. Afterwards I was curious about seeing it in 2D how it feels and look...but no.All in all, the effects were of course cream of the crop. Everything was done to squeeze the last of 3D out of those gfx workstations and it shows. But the question is, what comes after this? It is not like anyone is going to outdo Avatar for a while. I can even hear George Lucas scratching his head from here. But Peter Jackson knows, and I think Hollywood does too; make it about the characters and the story. Instantly rendering Cameron without a job really. Har di har.DIRECTION Well, needless to say it is quite an undertaking to set something like this up. But strip away the million dollar effects and then what do you have? Still some very nice, dynamic but familiar camera work, lighting always seems oddly even (because of the green screening) but the sound is just amazing. My hat off for the people who did that. ACTING Somehow, even in the darker bits, the actors seem quite upbeat in this movie. Maybe it is just me, maybe it is because the non-cgi actors did not have to squeeze out the majority of terrible one-liners. The double irony is, that for a 3d movie the characters are very one dimensional, but the actors do a reasonable job of making the best of it. I was surprised to see main characters being filled by actors I admire but also surprised by actors I did not know at all. So all in all 7 out 10",positive
347,"When I left my flat to see a screening of Avatar earlier, I noticed a beautiful, thin, orange sliver of a crescent moon in the sky, and it was, from my perspective, sitting just above the cinema I was going to and I thought 'How beautiful, I hope it's a sign of how good this film is going to be.' It was.What other action director has a heart as big as Jim Cameron? Remember the way he brought Linsay back to life and how she and Virgil fall in love with each other all over again in The Abyss? The relationship between Arnie's terminator and young John Connor in T2? The romance at the heart of True Lies? And then he gave us the emotional mega-whammy of 'Titanic'! Now he delivers a film with not only a beautiful love story at it's heart, but suggests that there is a planet somewhere on which every inhabitant is completely in tune with every other creature and the planet's ROOTS in such a way that if and when it's existence is threatened, they all come together to defend it....Any director who goes to the trouble of INVENTING the technology needed to see his vision come to life the way he wants and the patience to disappear off the radar for 12 years, painstakingly making sure it looks and feels and sounds exactly as he envisioned it deserves a new category of Academy Award. Most Groundbreaking Film of the Year award perhaps? About half an hour into watching this film, I realised I was watching it as a film critic, looking for flaws, then I turned that part of my mind off and decided to just let myself enjoy the story, and the effects, and the music, and the colours, and the humour....Yes, we have seen the basic story before, it does resemble Dances With Wolves and The Last Samurai, and Cameron sets it all up a bit quickly and too easily, but I can think of no other director who can take such familiar material and inject it with such joyous, ecstatic enthusiasm. It does take a while to build up, but until the action really kicks off just sit back and soak up the beauty of what you are seeing (the reinvention of how films are made). Incidentally, don't go in expecting any shocking moments of things seemingly flying out of the screen, it's not that kind of 3D film (although there are little white spidery type things that seem to dance in front of the screen), the 3D here just invites you in, in fact I'm looking forward to seeing it again in 2D just to enjoy the emotion of it, and again in IMAX to really get the full monty, and probably again just because it has to be seen on a big screen before it leaves cinemas, but I suspect that is a long way off.Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich take note, the master is back, and he has pushed 'the boat' out yet again.Edited 24/12/09....I have been watching this films position on IMDBs highest grossing movies of all time and it has jumped from #295 to #240 in 24 hours!!! So to all you naysayers, whether you like it or not, something about this film has captured people's imaginations and hearts just like Titanic did. According to my calculations, all Avatar has to do is perform like this for another month or so and it will be neck and neck with Titanic as far as gross ticket sales is concerned, and I couldn't be happier!!",positive
348,"I remember all this hype around this film, it was exteremely popular and many told it was the most extraordinary film they had ever seen. But is it now? Certainly not. It is the product of its time and it doesn't look so stunning in 2021. Of course all this unique world and CGI drew our attention in 2009, but most of us didn't notice that there's hardly anything more than graphics that is new and unique about this film. Its story is a bunch of predictable cliches about an encounter with a different civilization. To the most famous films which showed us exactly the same sequence of storytelling belong Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. In such stories we have a protagonist who is on the side of his people and wishes to fulfill his duty, then he acidentally happens to be among his enemies which turn out to be the good guys, understands how bad his own people are, trains his new allies to be more effective against his former friends and bosses. In some cases he may also have relationship with their woman. And in the end they win suffering great losses. We had seen absolutely everything from Avatars story except for new planet and slightly different reason for protagonist to begin his journey. Some scenes were even taken directly from The Last Samurai. Oh, and that 3D, which was in every more or less expensive movie till 2015, having only a f few effects, but making films dark and harder to watch.After 2009 we've seen dozens of films looking more realistic visually and suggesting us more interesting stories without constant repetitiveness, so I see no reason to watch Avatar in 2021. Only if you want to see what film is the highest-grossing and to be aware of its story if you wish to see it's sequel next year, you can watch it. If you want neither of these things, you can skip this movie.",neutral
349,"James Cameron returns and shows these wannabe rookie directors of recent times how it's done. Finally a good ""old school"" film that is worth remembering. This has been one of the weakest years in film-making that I can think of. When extremely low quality films like Transformers 2, New Moon, and Wolverine are some of the biggest hits of the year, you know something is wrong. Leave it up to Cameron to save the day with this fresh and unique cinematic experience. Avatar is everything that it has been hyped to be and is nearly flawless in it's execution. Cameron, unlike Michael Bay and every other crappy director of today, actually shows just as much care in crafting a compelling and involving story as he does in delivering mind blowing visual effects and action. Cameron knows that with out a good story and characters that action is just a bunch of noise. He really knows how to invest his audience so that when the action kicks in you are on the edge of your seat in suspense. The film runs long but everything pays off in full. There is only one plot point I can think of that doesn't have a pay off but it's barely even worth mentioning. The allegory of indigenous tribal people being forced off their land by a more sophisticated race isn't a new concept but it's executed very fresh in this story. It really makes you feel guilty to be a human being as we are the true villains in this film. You cheer for the Na'vi to kick our asses in the end. Cameron definitely does a great job of sending a message. The visual effects are ground breaking and are undoubtedly going to clean out the Oscars. I heard one audience member say that Avatar was ""the most beautiful film I've seen in years"". I definitely have to agree with that statement. The creatures and the environment they live in looks so good that it could fool someone into thinking it is a place they could visit. The action always serves the story and is never there just for the sake of having explosions. Michael Bay needs to take some notes. The action is used carefully but when it's on screen it's jaw dropping. You'll find yourself cheering, laughing, and crying all with in a single action sequence. There is also a surprisingly very genuine romance at the heart of this film which makes it a great date flick. The movie breaks boundaries of genera and is made for all audiences. The cast is also worth a respectable mention. This Sam Worthington guy came fast out of no where but he is definitely here to stay. It's very rare that a guy can make a sudden jump on to the scene and bring with him this much on screen charisma. He stole the show in Terminator Salvation and now totally carries the film on his shoulders here. He is a total natural and really delivers above and beyond. Zoe Saldana, his romantic interest, also made a sudden leap onto the scene and nearly steals the show. Her performance is the heart and soul of this film. It's also great to see Sigourney Weaver back in a big film. Now if only Cameron could give Michael Biehn a big break like that too. There isn't a single weakness in this cast.Avatar really is the big event that Cameron has promised it to be. If I had to pick any flaw with it I'd say some of the dialogue could use revising and I'd really like the physics of how mountains in this world float explained. All in all though, it's very hard to think of anything to complain about this movie. Cameron has proved that he has still got what it takes and that time has only added more wisdom to his film-making style. This film is deserving of great financial success, critical praise, and Academy Award nominations. If you're only going to see one film this year then this would be a good choice. It is a movie that must be seen on the big screen. I don't care how big and impressive your HD TV is because it can't possible do this film justice. Hopefully this will remind audience and filmmakers what movies have been missing these days. Story is the most important aspect of any film. Filmmakers must remember this or films are doomed to mediocrity. Avatar is a must see!",positive
350,"It's a special effects film, a celebration of the new 3D technology when it was still fresh. It's visually entertaining... but nothing more I'm afraid. I really can't say anything more. There's nothing to tell, there was nothing there. Just great effects. I wouldn't even call it a story, just a bunch of undecided plots here and there so they could use the effects for.It's something you would definitely want to have on DVD or external hard drive when you purchase a 36"" LED TV or new 3D TV cause you'd be excited to use your glasses. It's something you put on screen if you have an appliance shop so people will see the quality of your TV. But that's it.",neutral
351,"Nothing works in this movie : thin plot, bad acting, wonderful hippie blue people fighting evil white invaders, etc. Watching this for 3 hours was pure torture and so sad to think this is one of the highest grossing movie ever.",negative
352,"Many critics who have reviewed ""Avatar"" said that they initially didn't know what to expect going in. I bring this point up because I felt the exact same way. I'd seen posters for the movie, and previews for it in the previous months before it was released, but did not know what it was about, let alone if I would like it or not. In fact, I was so unsure how I would feel about it that I saw ""Sherlock Holmes"" before I saw ""Avatar"". All I knew about the movie was that it was about blue, cat-like creatures, and it was directed by James Cameron, a guy who is very easy to dislike as a person. After all, ""Titanic"" broke many records, but eventually came to be seen as bombastic and meretricious. Cameron's declaring himself ""king of the world"" at the Oscars didn't help much, nor did his immediate public divorce from Linda Hamilton, or his long stretch of not directing a followup feature film (save the forgotten ""Ghosts of a Abyss"" (2003) that should have been called ""The Making of Titanic"", and ""Aliens of the Deep"" (2005)).However, after seeing ""Avatar"", I can honestly say that there was not one inch of celluloid that was wasted in this film. Cameron may not be a nice guy, but when he wants to tell a story, he can tell it and not waste a dollar of his $250 million budget. As I serve myself a piece of humble pie, I'll even add that he probably does not care what an amateur, unestablished 27- year-old film critic thinks about him, and that's a good thing.I went to see ""Avatar"" in 3D (which is well worth the extra 3 bucks, depending on the movie), and I was afraid to blink in case I missed something. This is an epic movie well-deserving of the term ""epic"". Any time there is a scene where a helicopter is flying out into the Pandora wilderness, or even inside in the scientific lab or Marine base, I was taken aback by the design and the detail of everything I saw on screen. Nowadays, saying that a movie has great special effects is synonymous with explosions and societal destruction compromising the majority of the film. ""Avatar"" indeed has great special effects, and those latter elements represent a small percentage of the film.Naturally, like ""Titanic"", many people I spoke to had problems with the acting and the story line. One person I know called the movie ""'Dances With Wolves' In Space"", which I suppose it was. I also saw similarities to ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest"" (1992) and ""Pocahontas"" (1995), but by no means was the story a blatant ripoff of any of these films. I did think the villainous characters like Colonal Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfrige (Giovanni Ribisi) made the Native American allegory too obvious by frequently calling the Na'vi creatures ""savages"". It made their characters also seem one-dimensional, and they obviously hadn't been taught about the Battle of Little Bighorn in school.Other than that, I thought the acting was fine. Except for a few times his British accent slipped through, Sam Worthington had both a commanding presence throughout the film while also being a convincing moral compass. There haven't been many actors who can pull that off while playing a paraplegic. Sigourney Weaver, being no alien when it comes to science fiction roles, also did a great job here. And Joel David Moore was perhaps the breakout star of this film, doing a great acting job that truly redeems his role in ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" (2008). Lang's role as the hard-ass colonel may have been seen in other movies before, but there is no doubt that Lang knows how to play a great bad guy.Zoe Saldana, Wes Studi, and CCH Pounder essentially did voice-over work in their roles here as the native Na'vi of the planet Pandora. Still, there was not one second where their voices were not convincing. Saldana especially cemented her position as a convincing leading actress while not appearing as a human on the screen at all. I don't have to say that she deserves to be an A-lister. She will be very soon if she isn't considered one already.""Avatar"" deserves no less than 9 stars in my book. I usually give 10 stars to movies that are not only great, but really move me in some way. ""Avatar"" had a few weaknesses, but not enough to deduct a star from my rating. It was an enjoyable film that moved me on more than one level. I felt compassion for the characters, marveled at the scenery and special effects, and most importantly, didn't get up to go to the bathroom once during the film. When I went to see ""Titanic"" 12 years ago, on the other hand, I got up three times to go.James Cameron wisely made the reported $237 million it took to make ""Avatar"" worth every penny. Fortunately, I wisely made the $14.50 I paid to see it in 3D worth every penny as well.",positive
353,"I watched the movie for the 8th time now. Why? Because it is the first movie that tracked me that much into his own whole new world!Now there are a lot of comments: ""Nothing new, story lame, just special effects...""I admit it, when i watched the first 20 minutes I thought: This is going to be changing our understanding of movies? Seen that, heard that... Well after a certain point I just got so caught up in the hauntingly beautiful world and in the way the Navi are seeing their environment that when i stepped out of the cinema I wanted to buy the next ticket right away... This movie is creating an image of a world that is so perfect you don't want to get out of it anymore!Next comments: ""tones of cliques, propaganda...""First of all... which movie does not have anything like that in it?

354,"When you stop caring, or even noticing, the CGI, you know you're watching a good movie.I generally hate CGI, especially in large doses. It's disheartening for me to watch a big screen knowing that every little detail is there because someone thought to draw it. Nothing accidental, nothing by chance, or dropped in by human quirk. But Avatar made me not care. And that's really saying something.I fell in love with the scenery! This movie was simply beautiful to look at.The story was 100% predictable. You know what the protagonist is going to do, every step of the way, and sometimes you have to wait a while for it. But who cares? It was great. When it ended, I don't know where 2-1/2+ hours went! I honestly didn't want it to end. I didn't want to leave that world.This is what the big screen is made for!",positive
355,"***Spoilers ahead*** I was having a pretty lousy day when I entered the cinema yesterday. And despite James Cameron being one of my favorite directors and Aliens being one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, I was not sure about Avatar. The criticism has been about the story so naturally I was worried that this one would be all fluff but no substance. After having seen the film I can gladly report that is not the case, rather I would say the story and its themes is one of the stronger points about the movie, not considering the fantastic special effects.It seems unnecessary to recap the story since I'm sure you've all heard it a thousand times by now. To point out a few things about it that no one seems to have talked about I would think is a better thing. All of James Cameron's movies are in some way about dreams. He frequently uses his personal dreams as inspiration for his films, perhaps most famously the idea for the Terminator which he got from a fever dream. This motif is used to its fullest extent in Avatar, where Jake Sully's journeys with his avatar body are like dreams from which he has to wake up. It all takes a fascinating meta-level when you think about our mediated world today and how many things we do just to get away from our real lives: Playing video games, drinking alcohol and of course - going to the movies. The very final scene of the movie is a clear nod to this notion. One could view Jake Sully's very physical disability as an analogy to any sort of disability or disadvantage that would keep a person from doing what they want. In the dream world that Jake flees to he has everything he ever wanted; Adventure, a beautiful potential love interest, ""people"" or rather Na'vi who care about him and so on. In the grey, cold and lifeless world he comes from, he is just ""meat on wheels""; A nobody.The movie actually leaves you with a bitter sweet feeling. Nobody's existence on this planet can be as wonderful as living on Pandora, much like Jake Sully you don't want to ""wake up"", but after 166 minutes you have no choice. Thank God you have the option of seeing the film again which I will do for sure, wallet-raping ticket prices for the 3D version or not. It certainly is worth it.People think the characters are thin and the story is clichéd and predictable, but I could not agree less on all points. To me it seems like a conspiracy, an attempt to bring the film down. I've seen a lot of movies in my days but most of the time I could not predict what was going to happen. The critics seem to be mistaking narrative means of telling a story with clichés. More than anything, the use of familiar themes and shapes for the animals and so on, is a sign of good storytelling by letting the audience recognize the familiar and thereby relate to the film on another level.In the above tirade about Avatar's story I have not said much about the special effects in the film which of course are outstanding, but they are very seldom there as anything more than a means to an end, just like in any good science fiction film. The same goes for the 3D, they are never just a gimmick where they point something straight into your face, it's just there to add to the whole experience. Avatar is far from a perfect movie, you could easily cut about 30 minutes out of the film and still tell the same story, and some moments are cringe-worthy. But as an experience, which to me is what movies ultimately are about, there is simply nothing that compares to Avatar.",positive
356,"where to start? the unoriginal ideas? stereotypical acting? racial profiling? (in my opinion). overall the whole movie is a simple piece of unoriginal crap. the only thing that makes it worth watching is the visual effects. a true embarrassment for the amazing James Cameron and all science fiction films out there. the combination of one liners, simple characters and predictability make this film truly disastrous. not to mention. maybe i was the only one but when i watched the extended version there were scenes of (alien) buffalo hunting and even dancing around a fire and acting like idiots! such scenes led me to think of racial profiling. overall, the film a a massive smelting pot of cruddy embarrassment.",neutral
357,"The only reason this movie was worth watching was the graphics. The acting was bad, the plot is the exact same thing as Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas, and it is extremely overrated. An 8.2 on this site is a compliment. This deserves a 6.2 at the max. you can tell I hate a movie when I'm rooting for the bad guys. I was rooting for the humans while watching this movie. The movie is entertaining, but it's long and has really stupid parts that should have been cut out. It's also quite scary watching giant blue things have sex. Thank you very much, James Cameron. Which reminds me, watching this movie made my respect for Cameron drop. He can do better than this. Aaron Seltzer can do better than this. Jason Friedberg can do better than this. Avatar is good for graphics, but bad for everything else.",positive
358,"i went to see this movie with high expectations. i must say this movie really did not fail to succeed. it took my breath away. the movie is just that amazing. certainly the first time. the movie is just so beautiful created and brought to you. i have yet to see the 3d version of it, but i hope it will be even more amazing then the 2d version. the plot isn't original, looks a lot like pocahontas. but just because the plot isn't original, doesn't mean it is bad, like a lot people say.imagine the pocahontas movie, but now twice as long, 20 times as beautiful and its realistic. but because this is realistic u don't have the messed up animals that can be funny.this movie was made to get the people back to the cinemas, and it did not fail.now, to all the people that gave this movie a 1 or 2. HOW?! if u didn't like the plot or script, fine. but i cant imagine that this movie earns a 1 or 2. i mean this movie LOOKS so beautiful. the way it is made and gets shown to the public. if u rate a movie a 1 or 2, that means the movie was UBER bad, like, everything about the movie sucked. well, i cant believe that anyone, even the haters, think that this movie sucked in every aspect. that just isn't possible with AVATAR.",positive

If you take the visual away all you are left with is a predictable shallow story with one cliché after the other. As it is a James Cameron movie, I guess one could have figured that out right from the beginning. How ever, if you want to be visually amazed and can turn of your brain for around 2 hours you should go see this movie at the cinemas, in 3D. The guys who are responsible for the visual really deserve an applaud, and once you are done applauding and you might want a laughter or two, look around you and you'll see all these mutts (just like you) with these Buddy Holly-3 D glasses...now THAT is entertainment!",neutral
360,"I was initially a bit skeptical when I saw the trailer of Avatar. And that is normal considering how many of the modern movies with enormous budgets are absolutely rubbish, but this one is different. Of course we just couldn't expect James Cameron to screw up this kind of movie. Quite the opposite maybe it isn't a new titanic or a new terminator, but is definitely a masterpiece.One of the things that sets this film apart from the others from it's gender is that even though the actors are not very famous most of them are young and very promising. They are able really convince you that the feelings of their characters are genuine and not everything nowadays is about computer animation and special effects. The world of Pandora is amazing from the very beginning you will just be caught in the beautiful and fascinating way in which everything is created it is just beyond belief, that anyone could have such imagination. One other ting is that the native inhabitants are no at all made disgusting if you have to compare them to the humans you will probably see our race as ugly.All in all this movie has everything strong story, big budget, good actors and most importantly flawless execution of the whole film. No matter how old are you or where are you from you will most certainly like Avatar",positive
361,"The ""King of the World"" James Cameron is back with his most ambitious project yet, a project that took over ten years to make and cost $300 million. This time he has set about creating the most realistic environment generated on computer that has ever been seen on film and has done a fine job of it as well. The movie begins with paralysed marine Jake Sully replacing his dead brother in a project to win the trust of the Na'vi, the native inhabitants of the moon Pandora who are at war with the human colony searching for ""unobtainium"" the mineral to bring life to a dying Earth. To do this they set about creating vessels called Avatars for the minds of the scientists and marines to inhabit allowing them to communicate with the Na'vi more easily. The characters are perfectly acted with Stephen Lang as the war mongering Colonel Quaritch and Sigourney Weaver as chief scientist Grace Augustine the stars in Pandora's sky but leads Sam Worthington (Sully) and Zoe Saldana as the princess of the Na'vi, Neytiri give good performances as well. With the team that brought Lord of the Rings to life behind him, Cameron has blown all other special effects out of orbit with this stunning masterpiece of visual stimulation. Through the beautiful scenery, the native creatures and the Na'vi themselves, you are encased in a world where every bit of detail has been accounted for and the results are stunning as a result.Yet for all the imagery and detail the effects team has come up with, it can't hind the problems with the script which is as cliché ridden as a Leona Lewis ballad – which is presumably why she's on the soundtrack. The stone cold marine falling in love with nature, the budding romance that forms between Jake and Neytiri, the sneaky corporate executive and nature vs mankind plot lines all could have been lifted from a Hollywood handbook called ""basic plots"" and this results in the inevitable glances at the watch as the legs and behinds begin to beg for the slightly long winded film to finish. Avatar has raised the bar for all other action films in terms of imagery and special effects but it has not mastered the ability to tug at the heartstrings of the audience which other epics have done better in the past.",neutral
362,"Picture yourself going to an amusement park and ride THE best ride you have ever been on... This is how I feel today, and have felt even more intensely last night after having seen the avatar. I went to see this movie only because a friend of mine dragged me there. She didn't want to go alone and boy am I glad she did.Everything I want to say about this film has already been said on this site, so I'm just gonna add my comments to it. Yea so the story is something we all have seen plenty times before, nothing special there, but the execution of it is by far the best of it that I have seen...it's like eating chocolate, it always taste the same but sometimes the wrapping is so great that it makes you think the chocolate is The Best you have ever had :-) So if you want to just be entranced by another world and take a joy-ride of a colorful dream this movie is definitely for you!",positive
363,"If you go to this movie expecting some totally original new concept you'll be disappointed, however if you realize that the ""original"" thing is pretty hard to do now a-days without getting really out there and want to see a good plot done really well then you'll be in for a treat. It is visually spectacular (must see it in IMAX 3D!!) and blasts through nearly 3hrs with ease. I was in awe all the way through and when I left the theater I was on the phone with my bro telling him he had to see it asap. It's funny, I bought my ticket online and was miffed that it cost damn near $15, thought ""this better be worth it!"" By the end I immediately decided to take my kids next week and will gladly pay for all three of us :) I loved this flick, it's in my top 5 for sure.",positive

365,"The Most Important Movie Ever Made - is all I have to say about that.How awesome that James Cameron chose to say what he said in Avatar. How awesome that he chose to share the truths about the sacredness of live and how all being are connected. He could have shown fast cars, busty girls in wet t-shirts and scary guns. But no, he chose to show love, compassion and beauty.This movie is a powerful message, one much needed in times of lost illusions. I hope it reaches far and wide.I have seen the movie 3 times to date, have taken people I love to see it, and going back to see it yet again with more people I love. And all my friends who SEE love it, and all their friends who SEE love it too.Thank you, James Cameron.",positive
366,"Okay first off I know a lot of people love this movie and they're going to hate me for this review but its the truth that a lot of you just need to understand...Avatar was NOT very creative in any way whatsoever. Let me list the issues:A story that reminds me of Disney's Pocahontas too much. If you want to make a good movie, make the story better. If it takes you 15 years to make this thing then you need to get it right. The story needs to be much more original than that. It needs far more development and they should have more information in it for a 2.5 hour movie.Special effects that weren't actually very good, they could have done better when they spent that much money on them... The ""big battle scene"" at the end wasn't very big really... It had lots of explosives yes, but thats about all.The acting wasn't 5 star in any way. There were some pretty cheesy lines too. Why do we need this nonsense? If its going to be the movie we'll remember then great... But I'm not going to remember this thanks to its lack of creativity. Inception beats it, times ten.3D? Meh, overrated. Okay so 3D gets really old; I saw How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar in it. You don't even notice it after 10 minutes into the movie! 3D is overrated and definitely overpriced.",neutral
367,"Avatar is an average film with average acting and predictable story lines. (In fact the film is almost the same as Dune and several other sci-fi staples) The special effects are amazing! The graphics beautiful and the 3D stunning, but in the greater scheme of things this has not re-invented cinema, much like Titanic before it, it is an event picture to see, it has pushed the boundaries of cinema technology forward whilst not daring to challenge conventional story or plot development. But it has certainly raised the bar in the wow factor in films.Films like this tend to be super ceded by other technological marvels in a matter of years and then are almost forgotten about with only a few films (those with the story behind them) truly lasting the test of time. Avatar will always have its dedicated fan base but I feel this will wane over time as people see through the graphics to the rather shallow core.Avatar will remain in the consciousness for some time but I don;t think it will ever hold the affection of films such as Star Wars or the first two Terminator films, which whilst they also pushed the boundaries of film technology and story telling they also had a heart to their story making that made them stand out from the rest.",neutral
368,"When a smart and creative idea meets a great director of photography, a great editor and a great director, then AVATAR comes out.I don't mean to leave out the actors job which still is over the top of what I usually expect from actors, especially after I have seen 2012 which comparing with avatar is 2/10 rating.Excellent work on graphic, and smart especially because this sci-fi was not something we can't even imagine, but a reality where things we usually like are powered: The led on natures, the blue-green gradient, the tall blue habitants of Pandora, the great half dinosaurs creatures...AND the MOTION. The motion of things, animals and people was everything. From my point of view, Dynamism was the best part of it, besides the beautiful special effects of colours and shapes, the quickness of movements of the blue guys was amazing and astonishing. beautiful to see and to feel.Here another topic: James Cameron know s how to make people FEEL the movie. I don't understand how, but He knows how make us audience sniff flowers, touching the ground, and tasting the air of Pandora. I didn't watch it on 3D so this means it's not about the third dimension.About actors: I loved most of performance, I got something to say about the cigarettes that could have been avoided besides they have no sense in the movie, but great, great great.And the best part: When I saw ""The dark knight"" which I do like a lot, after Harvey got fired in face I told myself ""that's the end"" and I mean it cause I felt even tired of the next 45 minutes. Comparing to Avatar, I stand with holding tears for 1 hour and a half. For instance, Clint Eastwood movies got you in that mood usually during the last 10/5 minutes and you say ""this is a great movie"". But Cameron, damn gets you in after a hour and KEEP you there for the next 1 hour and a half, incredible, and when avatar finished, I didn't want it to finish.I really have a lot to say about it but I'll stop here, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING???? GO AND WATCH IT!",positive
369,"I agree, the effects are amazing and will certainly set new benchmark, same as ""Terminator 2"" and ""The Matrix"" did. The gray human ships/settlement vs colorful Pandora world is another nice touch, contrasting old, sick, technology obsessed world with new, pure one where all creatures live in harmony.However once you look past that the story becomes somewhat illogical. the first thing I noticed is that this is ""Dances with the Wolves"" with a happy ending. Outsider sent to native lands, becoming one with them and taking their side in the end.Next thing is that the ending isn't logical. sure, Na'vi won the battle, but looking objectively this is just a rerun of Zulu wars. Warriors are able to achieve one victory by combining their man(and women)power against small, isolated outpost and winning with weight of numbers, good tactics against superior weaponry. But as history shows, outsiders may suffer a setback and occasional defeat they can simply bring in reinforcements from their homeland, adapt to the environment and win with superior weaponry. Win couple of such battles, create a serious dent in natives man(and women)power and they simply cease to be big threat and become a nuisance, easily dealt with.as Pandora is seen as critical place for Earth's economy such place will not be abandoned just because one battle was lost. so after Na'vi win humans simply return some time later, armed to the teeth and nuke Pandora then strip mine it. Hell, with genetic engineering as advanced humans could simply develop virus that would kill Na'vi but be harmless to humans, release it, wait for them to die then continue mining uninterrupted.Overall I enjoyed the movie (despite irritating experience of wearing 3D glasses over my regular glasses) and am not sorry to see it. but I wouldn't consider it a great movie. Unfortunately people focus on the effects not the story. While the story undertones are clear (need to protect the environment, anti-militaristic message and so on) the plot soon falls into cliché. How many movies exist where a person from outside group is sent to native lands then adopts their ways and takes their side against his former group, either winning or loosing? ""The Last Samurai"" comes to mind as well.Worth watching but if you want to see something more than just stunning special effects then nothing to be that excited about",positive
370,"I have been there finally! I have visited Pandora. It was improbable! Mr. James Cameron, how did you manage to show it? How did you do it possible?I have no words to describe what I've seen. Full illusion of stay inside. It is the new world — the world of 3D. The cinema has turned over. About the same sensations, I think, those people who saw more than 100 years ago ""Arrival of a train"" they thought the same. (I'm sorry, if I inexactly remember the name of the first tape in history of cinema but there people were frightened and ran out from halls). Too most now — the truth without a fright.I don't know now how I shall go to the cinema more on other films. The whole time of my sitting in the cinema I was trying to understand. How? How is it possible to realize the whole world? It's gorgeous and fabulous picture. What imagination does Mr. Cameron have that he was able to recreate the whole planet in details and thoroughly? He did it with the attention, love and imagination to create all this portrayal of landscapes, trees, plants, insects, other living being and creatures Na'vi look as alive — they really exist. It's like unknown cameraman managed to spy upon another life. I never felt the same before. Shaking ears of Na'vi, sensible eyes and smooth grace of tribesmen. They are alive.Perhaps someone will tell: there is the weak and banal script. But never before it was possible to visit ""film"", to be inside there, before we simply visited movie-hall, we went to the cinema. And all story and all events now you are feeling together with heroes, you live in this film. You, as well as Jack, go and fly among Na'vi, and every time it's more heavier for you to come back in your old ""skin"", in the usual body, you wish to return to their wood. You're among Na'vi  you become Na'vi  It is unreal to estimate and approach this film from usual position of the spectator and critic. It shakes and overturns imagination. My language can't call all of these as usual term ""special effects"", it something new and more. Welcome in new decade or even a new century of cinema! Here it's — magic of cinema. It is unique! P.S. I — was on Pandora! And I want there again!",positive
371,"An $8.50 movie I spent $15.50 to see.Cameron rehashes plots from A Man Called Horse, Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai and countless 'indigenous species threatened by humans despite their greater humanity' science fiction novels.In fact I found a considerable parallelism between the society of the Na'vi and the society of David Weber's Treecats from the Honor Harrington novels, a nearly plagiarist parallelism that if I really had any hope of caring about the movie I might investigate further.Cameron's CGI efforts are notable, though he could have taken a chance like Hironobu Sakaguchi and Moto Sakakibara did in Final Fantasy: Spirits Within and had at least one CGI character with loose hair. Since Cameron only had twice the budget and 6 times the computing power he must have thought loose hair was extravagant.The CGI is good, on a par with that of Spirits Within or LotR or even Starship Troopers, but perhaps the quality would have been more obvious if half of the data wasn't washed out with the attempt at displaying the movie in 3D.So to summarize: A hackneyed nearly plagiarized plot, an adequate effort at CGI so that leaves continuity and acting to save this effort. And it does.Really, I came to watch Avatar because I have come to respect Sam Worthington, especially after watching Judgement Day once again. Worthington and Weaver both provide an excellent and solid portrayal of their characters and everyone else seems to be carried right along as well.After finally seeing Titanic I was expecting a bit more out of Cameron for continuity but really everything I saw was nit-picky so really not concerning.but really people, it isn't worth the effort you're putting into it.",neutral
372,"There have been so many reviews and comments made about this film that I simply had to see it. The fans insist that everybody should see it. So in order to honestly judge this blockbuster I have watched it.That was my first mistake, the second was not getting up and asking for my money back, the third was to allow the film to be force fed to me till the bitter end.Oh good god, where do I start....... breathing is more complicated than this tripe.The horrifically basic story is force fed to the audience at a rate of knots. Leaving most of us, with half an ounce of sense, a dribbling mess by the end.The sheer arrogance that Cameron has shows in this film is quite frankly second to none. It treats the audience as complete imbeciles.The movie is so clearly aimed at the simple masses I have to congratulate him and his team on their success. I am utterly astonished that the public has graced this film in the way they have. How they have watched this and raved about it is beyond me.The CGI displayed in Avatar is OK, but that's about it. Too much like looking at a cartoon. When you do get to see some live action - it looks too obviously different. There has been many a gorgeous film that has used CGI as a tool to further the vision, why Avatar simply hides behind it only becomes apparent when you uncover the script and story in the first five minutes.It is no different than buying a car with a nice paint-job, but no engine. Yeah, it looks great but you try and drive it.This will sound crazy but, after numerous years of planning the final result seems rushed. Like they got to the end, stood back nodding sagely at the pretty CG and thought.......""Damn, we forgot the script, story, actors.......!!"" Some may think my review a little harsh, but seriously it comes down to how films are marketed and reviewed. If this was marketed as a cheap sci-fi action flick - I may have changed my tune. To push this as the best film ever than will change cinema as we know it..... Come on, let's be sensible..... That was stretching the imagination a little too far. The viewer is already pre-loaded with this expectation of a film that in theory cannot go wrong, yet when you see it....... it fails on virtually every level.If you like movies with substance, avoid this like the plague. If you like movies that are the cinematic equivalent of a lobotomy, with a shiny paint-job, then go right ahead - but don't say I didn't warn you!!",negative
373,"This is a masterpiece. This movie has the best effects ever seen and has a story which shows our world: The people who are able to see the force behind things you can't see and touch; and the people who lost this gift. If you compare it with other 3D-movies, no with all other movies, you can't find a movie with similar effects.Watch this movie! If you are not able to see the message behind this movie and if your heart isn't deeply touched - go to a psychiatrist and learn how to get back this feeling into your life.If you are able to feel this connection deep in your heart, say thanks for this gift.",positive
374,"I am in love. Not with a character. Not even with an actor. I am in love with the world called Pandora.Rendered in exquisite detail, James Cammeron's world is near perfect in every facet. Of course there are little niggles. The obvious horse and deer analogues seem too close to home, as is the Na'vi's Native-American-like society, the majority of humans are very difficult to identify with and the score is not one of Horner's best, being highly fragmented and even more unoriginal than usual. But all this pales into insignificance next to the huge and undeniably beautiful world in which it is set. The story is functional and gives plenty of room for the flora and fauna to steal your heart, to the point that it will break when the inevitable crisis point is reached. It would surprise me if there were many dry eyes in the house at that point.So I give this film 10 out of 10, not for being perfect, but for what it is: a quantum leap in audience immersion. At no point did I find myself disbelieving the world which was presented me, not for one moment did I think ""this is only CG"". This seamless presentation of an entirely new world will set Avatar's place in the history books and left me wanting more. Much more.So go out and see this film. And then see it again. We are told that Cammeron's decision over the next film he will make will depend on the audience reaction to this film, and with a plan for at least two sequels I can barely wait to see what's next. As possibly the best sequel creator in existence (see Terminator 2 and Aliens) he can't disappoint us now, surely.",positive
375,"Wow! Bravo James Cameron! Nothing I have seen so far was so breathtaking! Special effects are another breakthrough! Well worth to see it for yourself in a theater.Mainly this movie gives us (the humanity) a chance to look in the mirror (which is not especially pleasant) and to survive as species.However, people who let their minds consider themselves ""the crown of evolution"" will not grasp the Idea and will not like the movie. For them, the main character remains a mere traitor. (oh, what should i say! what a pity!)We, people, have our mechanical toys OK, but watching this movie made me for the first time feel (indeed) that ""advanced"" people from a mechanical civilization have _nothing_ valuable to offer for such ""usual barbarians"" as Navi, who are living in perfect balance at Pandora planet and in perfect harmony with every creature.Definitely I want to see this movie again.",positive
376,"Plot: In 2154, the RDA begins mining on Pandora, a lush tropical planet in some distant galaxy. This planet is populated by the Na'vi, a race of blue, cat-like beings. In order to learn from the Na'vi, the Avatar program was created. In this, a human's mind is transported to that of a genetically created Na'vi. Disabled marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) is the latest to have an Avatar. His mission: learn from the Na'vi clan known as the Omaticaya and try to find a way to remove them from their homes, where a large deposit of a priceless mineral lies. But as Sully becomes attached to the Na'vi, including falling in love with princess Neytiri(Zoe Saldana), he realizes humans are the bad guys and must stop Col. Quaritch(Stephen Lang) and his soldiers from eliminating the Na'vi.James Cameron has done it again! After Oscar-winning epics like Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic, he has once again captivated us with a surefire winner. This is a visual feast for the eyes that makes Transformers and 2012 look like indie flicks. The effects are by far the best ever done in film making, and I'm not going overboard. The work on the Na'vi is the most lifelike I've ever seen. These creatures look pretty well like their actors, so that's ten points for motion capture. And Cameron knows how to cast 'em. Among the cast is Wes Studi, Michelle Rodriguez, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, CCH Pounder, and Cameron regular Sigourney Weaver who steals most of her scenes. And another grand thing is the score by legendary Oscar winner James Horner, who's also worked on various projects with Cameron. His beats give the film a true native feel. And I fully suggest this be viewed in 3-D, as Cameron's style of filming deserves to only be shown in that way.Last year, there was an incredible film called The Dark Knight, that became an Oscar winning billionaire that was easily the best of '08. Well, lightning might strike twice in the same spot with Avatar. This is the most flawless and satisfying film of the year. And maybe one of the best of the decade.",positive
377,"Just got back from watching Avatar and I have to say I was impressed with the 3d and the digital characters. The story, on the other hand, was comically bad.The 3d didn't work for everything, but it work the best when it was used for dust and particles. It really drew you into the image. The digital characters were better visually than Gollum in the LOTR films, though the ""character"" Gollum had nothing in Avatar that was even close.Visually, probably the best I've seen. Story, characters, and dialog, among the cheesiest films I've seen. (and not good cheese, like Army of Darkness) I don't know if it was worth the $ to see in the theater, but sure as heck wouldn't bother to rent or buy the DVD.",neutral
378,"Avatar is a good movie, it's not ""awesome"" or ""unique"", and it's not even by chance ""the best movie ever made"" (god no). For start, I don't find the CGI or animation being important in any movie, I found the plot, OST and characters being the most important part of a movie; in those aspects:The movie had a good (but not remarkable) OST, it's good, but after 3 hours becomes tedious.The plot was good also and I liked how they represented colonialism, but did you noticed that Jake NEVER speaks to the Na'vi about the unobtainium and why they were invading them? THAT WAS YOU PRIMARY ORDER DUDE!. It also had nothing new or ""revolutionary"" like all the critics were saying for some reason, it's just another random Hollywood plot which looks like if it was promoted by Greenpeace.About the characters, the only good thing I found is how the Na'vi were made, they're very convincing for me, but that was the only good part. I hated the rest of the characters, about Neytiri, the movie ended and I couldn't remember her name, I think they mentioned it like 3 times in the whole movie (she was a MAIN character) and she was like a bad-ass 16 teenager or something alike that doesn't seem right for a love nature princess; the ""evil"" guy had no brain at all, one would think that in a future where they can create giant-blue-people-clones, they would have some kind of mental standard to choose a general who will lead an army in the space, but no. And all the ""original"" creatures that Camron created, they seemed like a big ""Final Fantasy X"" plagiarism, really, FFX has a tribe of savage-blue-giant people, has an Eidolon called Ixion who is identical to the Na'vi's horses, has dragons which seems a lot like those in the film, and has flying light balls of energy like those ""jellyfish"".So in conclusion, if I had to choose between watching Avatar again or playing Final Fantasy X, I would stay home and play FFX, is practically the same with a better plot and more interaction.",positive
379,"I first heard about James Cameron's ""Avatar"" about three years ago on IMDb, and have been waiting eagerly for it ever since. And now that it's here, I can say that it is definitely worth the wait. ""Avatar"" is nothing short of a masterpiece.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is contacted by the US government to help on a mission: On a new planet called Pandora, some very valuable mineral ore has been discovered, but unfortunately, the largest supply is under a tree where an indigenous people, the Na'vi, live. The government, led by Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi, in full-on big biz asshole mode), wants them to relocate, and to that end, they have enlisted the military to help, led by Col. Quaritch (a chillingly evil Stephen Lang). A scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), is researching the planet and teaching the natives in order to find a more diplomatic solution. To do this, she has created avatars, which are Na'vi which humans, like Sully, can control through a machine. But when Sully becomes accepted by the Na'vi, he finds his loyalties tested.This isn't an actors movie, but the performances work. Sam Worthington is effective in a low-key performance, but he's capable of more volatile acting when the situation calls for it. Zoe Saldana is very good in the role of his teacher/love interest. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific as the money-loving jerk, calling to mind his villainous performance in ""Flight of the Phoenix"" remake, but he's not creepy here, just a jerk. After seeing him in a few previous performances and in the trailer, I had my doubts about Stephen Lang. I was proved wrong though, Quaritch is a nasty piece of work, and a terrific villain. Sigourney Weaver is good as the somewhat bitchy scientist, but she's still sympathetic.This is James Cameron's show, however. The story may be familiar, but a story is only as good as how well it's told. And ""Avatar"" is told brilliantly. Cameron has patience; he knows that the audience is going to be so enamored with visuals that it will be hard for them to concentrate on the story. Cameron allows time for the audience to get used to the visuals before the story really begins, thus two parts of our brain are not battling for control (although the visuals never cease to amaze).The best thing about ""Avatar"" is the sense of excitement. Even the most involving action movies don't get the sense of excitement going, at least not to this level. This is an immensely fun and exciting movie, and a must-see.This is an incredible film; I can't stress that enough. And I can't wait to see it again.Note: I didn't really notice the 3D, but maybe it was because I was sitting kind of far back. Oh well, it's worth it either way.",positive
380,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen around which there has been such huge amounts of hype! A visual treat, breathtaking ride, outstanding experience- are just few of the words to describe this ordinary affair. But in many places, the movie is so stupid and cliché it makes me cringe!First of all, the insane war on the Na'avi people is so sick and reminiscent of the present situation in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan. No explanation is offered at all as to what claim the shitty military men have on the land of the original inhabitants. I mean, hello? Any body has a sane mind over here? It is just as simple as come on folks. Let us wage a war! Bullshit! Where is ethics and rationality, huh? At least give some background to the audience about how these guys are in such a delicate situation of war. It turns out materialism is all you need to go bad and bomb an entire planet which you have no right to even touch. Good job making it real, man! And all of these people are shown to be Americans? How original! Deja-vu, anyone?Then also why are the Na'avis so trusting of this odd man out Jake (in the body of a Na'avi) when they don't know anything about him? IS that really how it works in tribes? NO! Our man Jake is not even touched. On the contrary, he gets a girl to strut about the jungle with and learn their ways! Well, he will be definitely learning how to bed Na'avi chicks, that's for sure!The military guys are so one-dimensional they seem like robots bent on destroying and kabooming every thing in their way. A stupid speech is all it takes to charge up hundreds of soldiers and make them charge and fight for no reason at all apart from a singularly materialistic one! What the hell! It is their land, you suck-ups. Who gave you authority to even land on their planet? But no, no soldier thinks that apart from our dull hero (will come back to him in a moment). Everyone is just happy following the goddamn orders without a thought given to err, how is this a noble thing? Jeez!And Jake Sully- he is the shittiest marine I have ever seen! Nothing is easy for him. He can't fight, can't climb trees, can't fly properly even if he has this awesome Na'avi body! After finally, when he does learn to do some of the stuff, just like that he goes and overpowers the mightiest flying bird and flies on it to the Na'avi's amazement. Now he is the tucto or mucto-something like that and the NA'avi must listen to everything he says! Wonderful! A note to Cameron- if you want to establish a character's awesomeness, do it with a certain kind of warning- not just out of the blue. Don't expect us to believe that an a**hole tames the single bird a few actual Na'avi's ever have been able to do! Besides, I wonder if Jake ever thought of any strategy to counter the ammunition from the bad side! It is just we are from the mountains, we will be fine bullsh*t that convinced me he was a loser! Come up with some strategy, genius! Don't expect the Eywa to help you out of your sorry a**kicking...I could go on and on....CGI does not ,a movie, maketh! Remember this!",positive
381,"To be honest I had no real ambition to see this film - to me the promos made it look like a teenage, computer game type film. A friend asked me to go along and see it in 3D and because it was an excuse to get out of the 35 degree heat and intense humidity I went. I am so glad I did. It truly blew me away, not just the visuals which were AMAZING - sometimes hard to tell what was CG and what was real but the story and underlying themes which was so intense and reflected in a futuristic way what has happened over the centuries and to this day here on earth. James Cameron you are a genius, firstly by casting mainly unknowns in the lead roles meant you weren't focused on the likes of a Hugh Grant or Julia Roberts, you actually felt these people were real and not actors. But act they certainly can and Sam Worthington the future must look great for you (hey I am Aussie & I am biased!). Secondly by having an underlying message in the film which will leave you cheering one minute and crying the next he achieves truly breathtaking visuals with a believable story and a strong message bordering on criticism of the human race and it's unbelievable greed and stupidity. To sum up - very hard to fault, great acting, amazing visuals and a MUST SEE movie that will surprise you on so many levels and maybe leave you speechless - ENJOY!",positive

I felt as though the evil Mickey Mouse Disney CEO from the ""South Park"" episode with the Jonas Brothers was constantly present on the Internet and TV, telling the ""Avatar"" promotional staff and message board writers that, regardless of the plot, we, the potential audience, should not forget that ""it's in 3D...don't forget to mention it's in 3D!"" Is film now just about technological spectacle that we should totally disregard whether the storyline is a bunch of garbage? Is this what cinema has come to...just enjoy the 3D, and give us the Oscar? How crass! At least the Ray Harryhausen movies didn't pretend to be anything more than entertainment. ""Avatar"" thinks it's something better than entertainment. It's a preachy allegory that rams its message down the audience's gullet, using stock characters that have been in vogue in sci-fi for the past forty years.Even without 3D specs, I enjoyed the computer animation. Pandora (why this name? I'll get to the annoying allegory presented in ""Avatar"" later) is stunningly beautiful. The aliens DO express genuine human emotion, like grief and joy, very convincingly. Kudos to James Cameron for using the best state-of-the-art CGI techniques to make the Na'vi look realistic. The computer animation for the aliens most certainly DOES NOT look fake. So, King of the World, a tip of my regular specs (in lieu of the 3D ones) to you!Now for the plot...here's where I'll have some fun and be evil by to peeing on the King's parade! The villains symbolize the evils of mega-corporations in our own world. Then again, this theme has been done to death in far better movies, such as ""Alien"" and its Cameron-directed sequel and ""Robocop."" The protagonist's union with the alien tribe, and his relationship to the evil conglomerate, is reminiscent of a film that came out earlier in 2009: ""District 9."" I'm not saying the King of the World and the ""District 9"" people had a pizza party together one day and swapped plots over cans of Bud Light; but, there is probably plenty of plot repetition in Hollywood because there is a dearth of creativity. Great minds, contrary to the platitude, do not think alike; mediocre minds do.I did like that Cameron made the aliens primitive hunter-gatherers rather than high-tech space explorers. In a sense, the Na'wi, who literally live in the trees in a green forest moon, are Ewoks, expect not as cute and cuddly. Anyone who has seen ""Return of the Jedi"" will start to wonder whether Cameron visits Skywalker Ranch for some R and R with George Lucas, where both men extol their own wealth and genius. The Na'vi are, like the Indians in Westerns since the 1970s, ""noble savages"", with a pedestrian New Age spirit. They LITERALLY commune with nature and worship Mother Earth, whom they call Eywa. Paging ""FernGully"", Dr. Cameron? The fact that Pandora is alive is a thinly-veiled reference to the Gaia Hypothesis. This idea was presented without any preachiness in ""South Park's"" ""Lice Capades"" episode and George Carlin's monologue, ""The Planet is Fine."" I hate being preached to by a man who, ironically, consumes plenty of Gaia's resources by virtue of being wealthy (we're all guilty of raping Mother Earth, by the way, but ""Avatar"" simply wags its finger at us and doesn't offer any practical solutions).In all, I must repeat... ""DON'T FORGET IT'S IN 3D!!!""P.S.: I rate this film as highly as I do because the actors do a hell of a job, in spite of their clichéd characters.",neutral
383,"What a waste of money, energy, creativity and intelligence. Never before in the history of mankind, were we presented with such an enormous pile of dong disguised as a beautiful and lovely rose. And most people, or sheep, bought it! Have people here lost their minds? Best movie of 2010? Don't we need a story to really feel a movie? To connect to the characters being presented? To stimulate our brain, our intelligence? This ""story"" was a complete rip off of better movies, with better stories and i feel insulted as a moviegoer.

384,"The King of the World has returned! Mr. James Cameron's youngest ""Avatar"" is a mind-blowing adventure and the most impressive and intricate work of art, I've ever seen.When his twin brother is killed, disabled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited to aid a mining expedition on the distant jungle moon of Pandora as only his DNA will bond with the alien hybrid body, known as an Avatar, that allows humans to breathe the toxic air. With orders to infiltrate the Na'vi, Jake finds himself falling in love with native girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).""Avatar'"" was created twelve years ago by Cameron, but was ahead of its time. Cameron had to shelve the project and wait for technology to catch up to the script he had written. In 2005 Cameron thought he was close enough to push the technology to tell the story he always wanted to tell and went back to work. It cost Jim blood, sweat and tears and of course a lot of money, but the result is just fascinating, mesmerizing. Money well spent.I am really happy that the movie turned out great. Not just for Jim's sake or because it had been a while since I'd seen a really good movie, but because of all the ""Avatar"" haters out there. All of those people who were trashing the movie before even watching it. They didn't give the movie a chance and let everyone believe that the movie was going to be really bad.Well, they were all wrong and I hope they are honest enough to admit that. OK, maybe the love story wasn't really original, but it worked. However, if the story doesn't work for you, everything else will make up for it. When you watch the movie in 3D it becomes a transcendent and amazing experience that's the closest you will ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. The length of the movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes, but it looked a lot shorter. I wanted more. I just didn't want it to stop. It was that good.I advise them and everyone to give the movie a chance and watch it the way it was mend to be watched, in 3D. You won't regret it! Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When you're watching the movie, it's completely normal to be attracted to Neytiri  Right? Heck even Jim says he's attracted to the Na'vi creatures!",positive
385,"First of all id like to apologize for my bad English. I just have a different opinion of this movie, and i thought maybe some one else shares it with me. To begin with the part the all people loved (so did i), the effects. What can i say? they were great. Its obvious why the film ate 400 mil. Imax delivers almost real life experience, and the feeling is absolutely amazing. Doesn't matter how rich is your imagination, you never saw this coming. Cameron will just surprise you with landscapes, color, action, effects, all of it. Every detail is carefully taken care of, and the result is 100% life-like everything. The music was also great. It blends perfectly with the action and story. I remember the same feeling from lotr. I said to myself ""i got to download this when i get home"". The story on the other hand was used before, nothing new. But the way it was implemented is somehow different. From the beginning to the end i felt trapped in the characters skin. I forgot all about the popcorn and soda, and i experienced almost everything that jake experienced. I discovered a whole new world, and this might sound childish, but just like jake, i fell in love with it. I think this ruined it for me. The na'vi don't have spaceships, television, mobile phones, they don't have money, and they don't have guns. I realized that us humans have A LOT to learn from those simple creatures with only bows and arrows. They are much better than us in so many ways. Overall the film is perfect, but at the end i was sad because i woke up from the beautiful dream that it was for me.I saw this on Christmas eve, and even though i didn't get any presents from Santa for quite a while now, that night i wished that we could all change, and of course that i wake up as jake sully :).",positive
386,"James Cameron has never failed me. Ever. So what if he takes 10 years to make a film? So what if the limited screen shots of Avatar showed weird blue aliens? I believed. I believed it would amaze. I stood in line at midnight and was rewarded with an unbelievable 3D experience that may never be rivaled. I am so thrilled when a movie arrives that actually warrants the hype behind it.Avatar and the world of Pandora is a wonder. Every blade of grass, every animal fits seamlessly alongside the real-world actors. Never before has CGI looked SO REAL! The 3D aspect makes the film come alive. When the characters walk across a tree limb hundreds of feet in the air, you can look down and feel it! You soar through the air and ride the wind. You are most certainly along for the ride.Science fiction is about story-telling. It allows you the freedom to tell a story without limitations. I do not believe in spoilers so I will be careful of what I say, but many people complained that the story was nothing special. To these people I say, James Cameron told a story about the interference of cultures. How imposing oneself and one's beliefs into a world can have consequences. He told a story that would have been at home in any science fiction story from Ray Bradbury to Philip K. Dick. Cameron told this ""basic"" story (and love story) with such stunning clarity, power, and sheer film-making thrill that I cannot believe any would fault him for being un-original. Especially in a film this ground-breaking.This film was the opening salvo in a movie making revolution. 3D powered blockbusters may be the wave of the future. In the here and now, James Cameron is once again king of the world and leading the way.From Aliens, The Abyss, and the Terminator series (HIS TWO FILMS!!!) this man is THE MAN you want directing a science fiction epic. He has topped them all with Avatar. Stunning, masterful, every other superlative. I only hope the next wait is slightly less than 12 years...Either way, it will be worth it.",positive
387,"I just got home from my second journey to the planet Pandora and I am still pretty speechless. James Cameron created a wonderful world here that I just can't get enough of.I love movies and have seen a lot good ones in my life but none of them ever got me as much as this one. I can still feel the goose bumps because I pretty much had them over the length of the whole movie, which is also something I have never experienced before.Cameron has done a flawless job in creating the perfect entertainment package with stunning 3D pictures, mind-blowing sound, and heart-touching music. I have to say that I usually talk a lot, even that much that my friends and family are trying to find something I could not find a smart answer to. They have not succeeded until today. While walking out of the theater my girlfriend just asked me how I liked the movie, but all I could answer was ""uhm...well.....wow.""In creating Avatar, James Cameron used state of the art 3D technology to bring these terrific pictures on the screen. If you are thinking of watching the movie in 2D or even only 35mm, you should reconsider. This world just is designed to be seen in 3D.Now the question is whether to watch it in IMAX or RealD 3D. Well I have seen both and think that while the IMAX experience has the superior sound and a bigger screen, the RealD 3D technology creates the better 3D effect. The screen is no longer just a flat surface, with the comfortable RealD 3D glasses on your nose it is a window and it seems like you could just reach through and touch what you see.When you are still arguing with yourself whether to go watch it or not, just do it. I have seen it twice now and I will definitely go and watch it at least one more time, but most likely more than that. It's that good.I think James Cameron has created a glorious and epic adventure here and I can't wait to see more of Jake, Neytiri and the rest of the Na'vi.",positive
388,"I felt pretty embarrassed while watching this movie, like more than when I went to see Twilight or Harry Potter. The characters have African accents and features, fake native American ''culture'' including feather head-dresses and using every part of the animal, blue smurf skin and ride around on pterodactyls like Everquest. And they do drum dances to worship a tree god. like, an actual tree that is their god. literally. not as a metaphor, and not a talking tree, just a plain old burnable wooden tree that is also their god.We are clearly meant to take all this seriously, which is the really sad part: the audience was literally laughing out loud. I mean...I've written some stuff I'd be severely embarrassed to have other people read, and then other people read it, so I can relate to the writer here. I feel bad for him. but STILL.Everyone keeps saying in the other reviews how much money is involved as if that makes the movie good when to my view it makes the whole situation even more embarrassing. There is no way i could have overestimated this movie's moronicness before seeing it, yet we've mobilized massive amounts of our modern cultural capital squarely behind something that reads like everquest fanfic. I'm a little bit frightened by all the positive reviews---I'm afraid people are going to spot me and say ''you're not one of us'' and either give me a lobotomy or try to eat me.My favorite character was definitely the corporate overlord. He refers to what they seek as ''unobtainium'' which is an old Usenet/scifi word, and I chuckled because his character was so clued-in and terse in his evilness, made it fun. but then later in the movie he shouts in a serious high-action moment ''the unobtainium is underneath that rock right there!'' and then military dudes fire on the rock, or something, as if the corporate guy doesn't realize it's not actually called unobtainium. That's just a snarky stand-in word for when you're explaining a common story to someone else and want to say ''who cares what it really is,'' when of course it _is_ something specific when you're outside a moment of reflexive exposition. It's like the writer heard some clued people talking to each other, didn't really get what they were talking about but decided he wanted to be just like them, then tried to mimic them. like when a five year old tries to swear like a drunken sailor but doesn't know how to use the words right yet so he sounds all FOB-y, the movie was like that.also like i said, they have blue skin, talk like continental Africans, and ride around on pterodactyls. please don't forget that part. If you think you can handle this, whatever, go for it.",neutral
389,"I remember, back in 2009, seeing this film for the first time and thinking this was one of the coolest movies ever made. Unfortunately, as I got older, more things about the plot started occurring to me and the magic that once captivated me as a little kid began to slowly fade away. Let's bring up some positives. Something that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, the visuals were fantastic back then and they still hold up today. James Cameron is a pioneer when it comes to the technology behind filmmaking and deserves all of the accolades him and his team can get for that field. Out of everyone in the film, I'd say Sigourney Weaver gives the best performance as the scientist, Grace. I'll also give credit to the motion capture performances behind the Na'vi. Now, I will say that the biggest gripe I have with this film is not the similarities to other stories that many others have brought up, but the mixed messages it leaves you with. At the beginning of the story, it is stated that Earth is dying, which suggests that humans have come to the planet of Pandora for more than just a financial gain. What the story decides to do next, is to gloss over that and instead focus more on themes, such as the evils of corporatism and the raping of the land. While such situations as those should be brought up and put in check, this film decides to ignore certain plot points in order to push those themes, which makes the ending for this film all the more bothersome. The Na'vi end up winning a war against the humans and force them back to their dying world. It seems to indicate that humans and Na'vi can't find a way to move forward together and that the human race should just accept their fate. Throughout the entire story, there seems to be this undertone of self-hatred, which didn't sit right with me. The sad thing is, the elements were there to tell a more beautiful and complex story. At the beginning, it is revealed that Jake's brother is dead and was originally chosen to be involved with the Avatar program. The story doesn't really explore their relationship or past. We never really get a proper perspective from the humans, mostly just the higher-ups. There could be reasons for the lower ranked officers or workers to be there, such as to help save family or friends back on Earth, but again, the film ignores certain aspects to push certain themes and yet, they could've done so much more. In the end, Avatar is a visually stunning film that ultimately gets brought down by it's story. Final verdict: 6/10.",neutral
390,"To be honest, I didn't expect too much from Avatar at the first glance when I saw the poster with dark-green aliens. I simply couldn't trust the media after all of their PR cheap technique. Still I decided to come to see Avatar for all the positive reviews it received regarding the 3D technology. And I was speechless.Not only was the movie good in terms of 3D visualization, but it also has certain layers of meaning that I found intriguing and worth watching.The theme is not new. It is a story about the relationship between human and environment. But what is new is how the story is portrayed in the movie.The Na'vi's world is our dream world. A world filled with beauty and interconnection all around, the thing that mankind have long lost in exchange for our technological development. ""Avatar"" is a metaphor for what we have all dreamed of somehow: a better world, in tune with environment and nature. And James Cameron didn't preach us; he just brought us to that world to witness its beauty and to reflect back on our world, on how we are treating mother nature.Cameron posed a question to the audience: are we really who we are? It's hard to answer; sometimes we just want to dwell in a world where we can live as our original self, wild but free. Technological developments does not guarantee happiness; and in fact, that is the lesson probably we all learned, in a hard way. Probably, we all hope that somehow our world can preserve some of it beauties like the Na'vi in Pandora.Despite an unoriginal motif, I still could not resist but give this movie a rating of 10. What else could you say of it? It brings you to a new world, that's enough after all!",positive
391,"I have to say that Avatar was technically phenomenal. The CGI was great, the details were incredible and the 3D was not slap in the face blunt as are some others. No flashy tricks to try to get the audience- just added an extra dimension to the film.Now for the Movie. Sorry but kind of disappointed. The story was old just a new location. But I can go for that. However the script was not well written. How many times can Zoe Saldana's character say Baby. And though I normally like her work a lot. Thought she was excellent in Star Trek. She was just not that good in this. Her grief scenes were overacted and just not believable. Also- for James Cameron, the guy who brought us stingray aliens in the Abyss, the planet lacked imagination. I mean every animal and plant there could easily be traced back to plants and animals on earth. Didn't he even consider talking to a xenobiologist for ideas on what life could be like on another world.I recommend seeing this for the technical aspects and a glimpse of films to come. However without all the technical tricks the movie just would not stand up. Sorry just one guys opinion.",neutral
392,"What can I say but this movie is AWESOME.Even when there is no action, the story is so good that you will not be bored.The total time of this movie from start to the end with the credits is 3 hours long. Totally worth it.Story of humans trying to take from the natives of the planet, it shows/represents how humans of one race took from the natives of the plant.The only difference is that the mother earth is sentinel and powerful, which represents the natives faith (believes).How one person (in this case was two main characters but also several other small rolls) helps the natives to fight against the more powerful enemies (which were the humans), to me it represents humans helping another.James Cameron's story in this movie touched me emotionally and his directing shows how when one race stands united to fight for what they believe in, it could happen.The story line, action, visual effects, characters, cast chosen, animation as well as the sound effects were all excellent.If I could afford seeing this in the theater everyday, I would.Just like Aliens, Titanic, Terminator and other movies he has written, produced or directed, he was expected be do great with this movie. It is.I wish this movie gets all the nominations and awards in the Oscars. I know I'm being unfair to other movies.His talent is vast and imagination is wicked... I say this as a good thing.Too bad he wasn't the one who directed LOR or HP but I have no complaints about those movies, it was good but imagine if James Cameron and Steven Spielberg combined working on those movies, how would that have come out? I have no complaints about any of those since they are my favorites but this one tops all, even Down Periscope, which neither one of them had any dealings with.I can't wait for the DVD to come out. If I had a dream house and had a huge home movie/entertainment center/room with a home theater wide screen, this movie would be watched everyday and all my children would watch this or made to watch this, hahaha!The story is so great and the message is clear. It describes the human race, how we are and also shows a likeness to how the environment is. We mine for minerals, coal, gold, silver and many other things that is effecting the planet. The natives are shown as to how they live a simpler life and value lives.I also love the way James Cameron brings out the somewhat ancient animals similar to dinosaurs. I highly recommend this movie even to children. There's no violence, just family, friendship, environment and human relationship issues. He also integrated action, adventure, fantasy, science-fiction and romance. What more can one ask of him!",positive
393,"OK, this movie certainly has got a lot of wonderful visuals, the characters are impressive (because they look real, not because of the script), that is true.BUT the story is so weak!Guy goes to some planet, people tell him to betrayal the natives, but, in the end, he can't do it. Add a ridiculous ""let's save the planet"" appeal and that's it.This movie is a blockbuster without spirit. Or do you think that Avatar is better than Sunset Boulevard, Dr.Strangelove and Apocalypse Now?I know the top 250 isn't very reliable, but let's respect the true masterpieces and put Avatar on it's place. Cameron did a good job, but nothing revolutionary.",positive
394,"Of cause I already voted 1 to it, but I still wish IMDb allows me to vote -100. Avatar is the lamest movie I'v ever watched. If you watched Dancing With Wolves, which is my favorite movie by the way, you know what I am saying. Avatar is just a sci-fi version of Dancing With Wolves, and of cause a much worse version of that. The story is weak, the characters are weak, the idea is weak. After 5 minutes you already know what is going on in this stupid movie, and you don't need to be a hardcore movie fan to predict the ending of this movie. Other negative reviews already mentioned the every detail about why this movie is overrated, so it is not necessary to say that again in this review. I just want to share my disappointment. Actually what makes me really disappoint is not the movie itself, since there are lousy movie all the time, but the high rating on this movie. IMDb indicates people's favor. And I think Cameron fooled people once again. He leads movie this great art to a lower level not higher. It is so sad. Actually I have to say, as a thief (he stolen whole story from other movie), Mr. Cameron used people, wasted people's time, and even worse he made young director frustrated by the Hollywood movie law--high costs equals great movie. Unarguably, movie is visual art, it has to be beautiful. So it is obviously correct that more technics should be used in movie to make it more visually beautiful. But if the visual beauty is the only thing left in a movie, I have to say, it is not a movie, it becomes a screen saver. So what is the point of a hollow beauty? It is just so sad that most people are cheated by this hollow beauty.",negative
395,"There's literally no point to watching this movie in the standard 2-D format. The movie is special in 3-D because only then will the audience see all the nuance details and effects that were intended to be experienced by Cameron. The story is nothing special, albeit more realistic since the bad guys aren't really ""bad"" in the traditional Disney movie, cookie cutter sense. There are some environmental issues that one must wrestle with during and after the movie, but perhaps this is not a bad thing. That is not to say the movie's story is bad, it's quite good that I believed in the emotional depth of the characters who were essentially figments of someone else's imagination projected into digital reality. However, it could be better, and improving the content is a task that future filmmakers must face if they are to truly push the frontier. With that said, the main innovation of this movie is the 3-D storytelling which significantly enhances the movie-going experience. In Cameron's other work Titanic, there was a great ""sunset."" With Avatar, I hope this is the ""dawn"" of a new era in cinema.",positive
396,"Quick..When was the last time you saw a movie that resonated with you and captured your imagination so viscerally that you could barely wait to see it again? Not sure about you guys, but in this day of cookie cutter, by the numbers, based on a graphic novel/comic book crap, I can honestly say I can't remember a movie that left such an indelible imprint . To say that the film, on a wholly visual level, is breathtaking would be woefully inadequate. I will just add my sentiments to the plethora of other reviewers and say that Avatar is like nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, I have ever seen. From the fully realized, lush and incredibly detailed environment of Pandorum to the incredibly lifelike cgi for the Na'vi humonoid race, all of Cameron's considerable talents as an effects wizrad of the first order are on full display here. Not since Smeagle in the Lord of the a Rings trilogy have we seen such startlingly lifelike and expressive cgi characters as the Na'vi. And Make no mistake, the Na'vi ARE the undisputed stars of this movie! Lithe,graceful,agile and capable of conveying intricate facial expressions and subtle emotions like nothing else ever animated, you'll find yourself almost forgetting about the actual human characters in the movie ( i agree with the critics who complain that they could've been fleshed out more) and savoring every single interaction between the aliens and Jake Sullys avatar. At nearly 3 hours long, Avatar is one of those rare movie going experiences that envelops you in such a way that you lose track of the time. Definitely not a movie that I'd take impatient childen under 8 to go see, but older kids will absolutely marvel at the cinematic acheivemant on display. And thus concludes my MANGUSHING for the year. Glad I saved it for such a film. Now go see it!",positive
397,"I saw the trailer for avatar several times before I saw the actual movie. The trailer gave me the impression that the movie would be about the typical Humans: Good guys, Aliens: Bad guys hindering good guys. Therefore the full movie blew my mind. How Jake actually becomes one of them was unpredicted. Although what did disappoint me was that the natives did not accept Jake after the destruction of their home tree, but I later realized it was an important event to unfolding the plot. The $400 Million was put to good use I must say. The 3D effects and CGI was mind blowing. I was not surprised that James Cameron would produce such an amazing film. The trailer's effect of falsely convincing viewers that they understand the plot was ingenious. I was definitely surprised on how the plot unfolded. I've seen the movie twice and can't wait for the third. Just one recommendation; See it at the IMAX. The 3D experience is incredible. I usually don't get pop-corn at movies, I just buy a large drink and have to go to the bathroom in the middle. Lets just say I almost peed my pants because I could not leave that screen. Avatar: 10/10",positive
398,"First off, this was more than just a movie. ""Avatar"" will be known as the event that changed how we experience films from now on. Yeah, the 3D was amazing but the action, vivid colors, mind-blowing scenery, and sheer sense of reality was overwhelming. I easily rate this movie a 10, one I hope to watch soon in Imax 3D. Now comes the interesting part. While I watched the movie I had an odd sense of deja vue, like I'd seen this plot before. On the way out of the theater I asked my girlfriend how she liked it. She said it reminded her of ""Ferngully"". For those of you not familiar with that film, it was a cute, animated good vs. evil kinda movie from the early 80's where this human guy shrinks to the size of a fairy and meets up in this forest where all these other little folk live and whose environment is threatened by an evil, possessed logging machine. And there's many other parallels. I'm wondering how much of ""Avatar"" was really imagined by Mr. Cameron and how much may have been influenced by this kid flick from almost 30 years ago. So if you have a lazy afternoon, get ahold a copy of ""Ferngully"" and THEN go see ""Avatar"". The similarities will make you laugh.",positive
399,"As i sat in the theatre i was not as excited as i wished i could have been. 3 Hours Later and the credits rolled i walked out with nothing but pride knowing that James Cameron who has been on hiatus for 12 years making crappy documentaries still has the magic to make great entertaining films.Avatar is about Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who is called to Pendorra to take his twin brother's place in a program where he turns into a creature called a Na'vi which are savage creatures which live on the planet.As Jake bonds with the creatures in his new form,he soon realises what the human's intentions are and decides to help this race in defending their planet.To start off.This film is spectacular viewing.The effects are wonderful and do not really need 3-D to make the viewing amazing although i hear 3-D is wonderful.I thought the creatures were wonderful creations which makes you wonder how did James Cameron make these fascinating creatures.Acting is also brilliant.Sam Worthington does a great performance as both a human and a Na'vi.Sigorney Weaver is also very good as the scientist.There are not really any bad things that i notices but apparently the plot is similar to Dances with Wolves.Well i don't think there were major or eye spotting problems.I thought the story was wonderful and there were no slip ups.So Avatar is maybe Cameron's finest work in my opinion.If a sequel is made then i will welcome it with open arms.",neutral
400,"Avatar is quite a visual masterpiece, and a real credit to just how far we've come in modern film. There's been too much abuse of CGI (Michael Bay, and your buddy Roland Emmerich) in too many modern blockbusters that the term ""special effects"" seems to go hand in hand with movies that are hastily written, badly directed, and more carnage than actual plot. ""Avatar"" sets a new standard for CGI, using effects for their original intended purpose, that is to accentuate the film itself, rather than as a mere decorative distraction.So much of this film screamed ""Star Wars"" and ""Jurassic Park"" to me. As a film student I often am at odds with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, as they are the fathers of modern cinema, but have also bastardized their own legacies in horrible ways. Its difficult to see Lucas as the man behind ILM, THX, Pixar, and the original ""Star Wars"" film, and also the travesty that became the ""Star Wars"" prequels. Its even harder to reconcile Spielberg's definitive masterpieces, ""Schindler's List"", ""E.T."", and remember that he was the mogul who greenlit Transformers and defaced Indiana Jones' legacy with that completely unnecessary and irreverent fourth film.But one has to remember what ""Star Wars"" meant to the world, how Lucas defined a new standard in sound (Dolby Digital) and special effects from a ragtag group of geeks who tinkered in a garage. Most of all, Lucas was the first to openly defy the studio system, going with the story that seemed an improbably success, securing his own rights to everything that he had created. ""Star Wars"" rejuvenated cinema because it was a movie that you had to see in theaters to get the full experience of his wild space saga. Jurassic Park was more of the same. When Dr. Grant sees the dinosaurs for the first time, there is just a feeling of complete awe that is so rare in movies nowadays.Seeing ""Avatar"" was like that. It was such an experience, especially in 3D, that you couldn't look away, couldn't even think about anything but the lush imagery of the film itself. Watching ""Avatar"" made me feel pure thrill at seeing scenery unfold, and although it is much to early to much such declarations, it may be a defining moment in cinema for my generation.That's not to say that this is the perfect movie, or the most amazing thing that I've ever seen. The plot is heavily clichéd, since ""Avatar"" really is a mix of the ""Matrix"", ""Pocahontas"", and the two aforementioned movies. As a culture, after dealing with the likes of M. Night Shyamalan and five seasons of ""Lost"", the plot for ""Avatar"" was pretty standard and easy to predict. There is an epic battle scene, which trickles down to basically hand to hand combat (or as close as it gets) between the hero and the baddie. Character-wise there is Jake Sully, the average-Joe of a protagonist, a wounded and world-weary ex-Marine to boot. There's Neytiri, the native Princess who teaches Sully the ways of the forest, and Stephen Lang plays the psychotic army Colonel who is hell-bent on being destructive and generally a pain in the ass. (A good year for Lang, after his wacky turn as a peace & love army guy in ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"").However, this characterization can be once again be viewed as using archetypes from mythology as discussed in Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"". I'd put money on the fact that James Cameron knows and has read Campbell's stuff, which identifies the underlying patterns in myths and legends, as well as spiritual traditions.In Christopher Volger's ""The Writer's Journey"", Volger expands Campbell's work from the 1940s into a framework for plot and character development in fiction, i.e. the formula for success. And it fits almost perfectly. When compared to ""Star Wars"", which was a huge influence on Cameron (it being the film that caused Cameron to quit his job as a truck driver and enter the film industry). the hero, mentor, villain, roles are pretty clear-cut and similar. For example, both mentor characters (Dr. Grace Augustine/Obi-Wan Kenobi) are killed by the villains, and end up guiding from the netherworld, as part of the spirit of the forest/the Force, which I think are the same thing. We even have a snarky, bad-ass pilot with both a Millennium Falcon and a last-minute change of heart of her own, echoing in the tradition of Han Solo. Well if it works, it works.What has endeared ""Avatar"" to me most of all is the technological breakthrough. For too long we've been trying to explain and confront the demise of cinema, because people simply haven't been going to see movies. Unfortunately, this takes away from our generation the experience of movie-going, of being in a crowded theater with other people and sharing a story with them. James Cameron has taken a huge step in bringing the cinema back, with 3-D and IMAX cameras that offer an experience that one can't replicate at home. The 3-D shows were sold out at the first theater that I tried to get tickets at, while the 2-D ones were mostly empty, even though you have to cough up an extra 3 or 4 dollars for the special glasses. Certainly an indicator of 3-Ds appeal.Will this last? I've been so sick of watching 3-D movies that do things for the sake of being 3-D, such as ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" last summer, when things were constantly being flung at your face, from rocks to dinosaur saliva, to Brendan Fraser's ass. Like special effects, 3-D will have to be used carefully and wisely to avoid becoming a euphemism for ""shitty"". But we'll cross that road when we come to it, I suppose.",positive
401,"The answer is a resounding, unequivocal, no! Do NOT ""wait until it comes out on DVD"" to see this film. This film must be seen in HD 3D. This is not to say that the film is carried by the CGI or other special effects, it just wouldn't be the same experience. And that's what this film is above all, an experience.Ever since I was a boy and watched in awe as Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the moon, I realized, with sadness, that humans would never visit another planet in my lifetime. I was wrong. My dream has been fulfilled. I didn't just see a movie about another planet, I was ON another planet. Avatar breathed life into the planet Pandora in a way no other movie has even come close to achieving.The detractors say, ""well, Cameron cheated, it was all just CGI and special effects."" That's like saying Van Gogh cheated when he painted 'Starry Night' because he used paint and brushes'. Yes, there were special effects, but those effects are just an empty canvas and a box of paints until a master like James Cameron applies the strokes so vividly, so beautifully, from his imagination to the screen. The same folks are calling it Dances with Pochahantas meets Ferngully meets Matrix meets blah, blah, blah. Why, because the story has classical themes that people have been drawn to since the time of the first cave drawings to Homer to Shakespeare? That's what makes them classics. Their truths are universal and enduring over the ages and cross-culturally.Should it win Best Picture? Absolutely, but comparing it to other movies in the Best Picture category is like comparing apples to Oldsmobiles. It's just not a fair fight. It's an experience, not just a movie.I could go on, but I won't. The acting was solid, but probably not in award contention. The writing, directing, art direction, aliens, life forms were compelling and fantastic. I will endeavor to see Avatar again before it leaves theaters. This movie may stay in theaters for another year, and if it doesn't it will be re-released in 2011 because it MUST be seen in the way it was shot and intended to be seen. Even the Flomax crowd will stay in their seats for the nearly 3 hour journey. Time flies when you are in another world.",positive
402,"Avatar kept me fascinated about halfway through the film. This because of the sheer amount of creativity in the visual effects (The whole film is more or less a 150 minute visual effect). For that, the team at WETA around Richard Taylor deserves every award that relates to art direction, visual effects one can throw at them. The flora and fauna on Pandora is extraordinarily well crafted and abundant of new and bizarre life forms. The virtual characters of the Na'Vi are so far the closest to believable ""real"" creatures, maybe with the exception of the great ape in ""King Kong"" which I personally find unmatched yet. It is thus the logical evolution of WETAs progress into the virtual realm which started in ""The Lord of the Rings"" where Gollum was the first step towards creating a believable virtual character. Yet the film still centered around human characters. In King Kong, the great ape already consumed 50% of the presence, and in ""Avatar"" the virtual characters do 70-80% of the acting (at least that's how it feels). In this respect, the film is really groundbreaking and the 3D enhances the feeling of realism in a great way. But the story of the film is too predictable and has been told a few times before. I immediately recognized ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Lord of the Rings (no surprise), and ""Final Fantasy"". I think the story / idea of the film has a lot more potential than just laying the backdrop for a standard action film. It could touch other, deeper questions, e.g. how jack Scully handles the inner conflict of being human half of the time and a Na'Vi half of the other time. How is it to fall in love with an Alien? Even if he sees Pandore through the eyes of a Na'Vi, he still has a human mind, right? There are many psychological and philosophical aspects that this film could touch. But the way the story evolves and the predictability made the film feel too long by at least 30 minutes. Nevertheless, this film is a must see for all those who want to see a technical milestone in film-making and for those, who haven't seen yet too many films where tension is created by applying the usual count-down tricks (""30 seconds before detonation..."").",positive
403,"Film very good, interesting and impressionable - 10/10! Today descended on it in a cinema, an excellent film, and it is a bit sad. Editing to me also has very much impressed, as is very qualitatively made. It would be desirable even to present, how many all founders of this picture have laid the forces, works, abilities, and the time to receive here such wonderful film. The film went about 2.5 hours, and it to me has even more surprised. It is said that the film is even better if than it to look in 3D a cinema, but me and so it was pleasant, though to everyone the taste on viewing. I was not too lazy to estimate at all a film on IMDb. Soo a film I advise all to look, as the film to concern the category ' Must have '!",positive
404,"It's been years since I've made a comment of a film on IMDb.com, but having read comments on here about Avatar being 'the greatest film ever made - period', 'Must be #1 on IMDb or so much more' or words to that effect I felt compelled to say a few words.I saw Avatar yesterday in 3D and went with no expectations. First thing I have to say is that it is by far the most technically jaw dropping film I have ever seen. It is truly astonishing effects-wise and a visual feast. However, there are a very very long list I could write of better films - in fact the more I think of it, The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens (films I have seen many times) are better films from the same director. As wonderful as visual spectacle that Avatar was, the story was so rehashed, weak and, I genuinely hate to say it, I found myself bored at point in this unevenly paced effort.I would still urge anyone to see it and draw their own conclusions - it's a visual masterpiece but comes at the expense of a really good plot, story, character development etc. It's not a bad story by any stretch of the imagination but it's nowhere near good enough to merit the praise this film is getting. 7/10",neutral
405,"AHHHHHH, where do I start?! I am shocked by the amount of positive feedback this movie has got. I mean, it was filled with nonsense crap. I am trying to write this in the most civil way I can but that's seriously the only word that comes to my head when trying to describe this film: crap. I cant believe how many people actually loved this, I even feel bad for genuinely hating this movie.I am not a sci-fi type of person and I have pretty much never seen a movie of this genre until now. I was hesitant about watching it but because I heard so many people talking about it and with such high ratings I thought it cant be that bad. It was. I mean, the time I decided to let go of my anti-sci-fi attitude, I found myself strongly compelled back to it.I am sure those of you who loved it will deem me as an 'uncreative unimaginative unappreciative-of-art' person. But whats so creative, imaginative, and artistic about it anyway?! Okay, the graphics and all of that was pretty neat, I'll give you that, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I am so bugged by people saying this film was so different and creative because it really really wasn't. What was different was the detail of the graphics maybe, but a film is not to be judged solely on the use of new technology, graphics, etc., but many other factors should be looked into like the actual plot, the story, the true originality of it among other things that quite frankly weren't properly considered, in my opinion, by the 10 star givers. Which brings me to the content and idea of the story ...Flying off to some planet trying to steal crap, and having the star of the movie fall in love of with blue weirdos who inhabit the planet and going against his own race for them, isn't very creative. It's stupid. There is no deep imagination in that, anyone can think of such a story, creatures on different planets, blue people, special trees? Foolishness. The whole idea, the connection the avatars had to the nature, the flying seeds, it was just weird (not good weird). I don't want to be superficial but thats truly my opinion and thats the whole point of reviews, one's opinion. Look at it this way, the avatars, the creatures that coming up with, was supposedly very clever, had worms in their hair. The worms or whatever would connect to the horse/dragon/ireallydontcare and tame them. Wow? Not so much.I found it to be belittling the human brain, not challenging it to look into deeper purposes or expanding its imagination and creativity by displaying impossible stories that would enlighten us in some way and make us think and appreciate and bla. To love this movie and find a deeper meaning or something in it would be an insult to (my) mind. However, if you were inspired by it and loved it or anything in no means am I intending this to be an insult to you. ;p Besides the whole content with all of its absurdity, it was too long. Two hours and a half of blue people running around is sheer torture.I might not have had such a negative attitude if there wasn't this much hype on about it, but I have.I am sorry if this was offending to anybody in any way, it is truly my opinion and I have really tried to like it but to no avail. xD.=)",negative
406,"James Cameron's Avatar is basically the best movie I have ever seen, and now every other movie doesn't even come close as being as good. The setting of the movie takes place on Pandora, a lush, green planet filled with mystical creatures including the humanoids called the Na'vi. This place is so beautiful and magical to watch, especially at night where all plants and even the ground light up majestically. A little while into the movie I could tell what was going to happen but there are enough little twists to keep it exciting and not make it feel cliché. I found myself falling in love with the characters and the Na'vi people. I have been twice to this movie in 3D and I could go 5 more times. All in all, I don't really need to say much in this review and I don't feel I need to convince anyone to go see this movie, just go see it, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",positive
407,"This is the best movie I have ever seen.. ever. The Dark Knight can say goodbye. My favorite movie is Avatar, and just in time. 2009 is almost over. Nothing like Avatar to end the year. I was just about to feel very awful at the end under I saw the main character, who's name I still haven't really gotten (I think it's Jack) survive. He's still alive.An alien world, similar to Earth's prehistoric times. The times of dinosaurs. Giant birds that you have never seen alive, and indegenous people that live their (unlike Earth had as far as we know.) We came there for a rock. Yep, a rock that sells for millions of dollars. If the indegenous don't leave, sucks for them, it's our land. We've created clones of the indegenous peoples that we put our Humans in, and Jack was one of them. He later realizes that we are very wrong, and will go against his race.Nothing like the giant big army guy boss dying at the end to make this movie feel excellent. I really loved it. There's nothing more I can say, and I doubt that this review will be on the front, but this will really be your best movie, too.",positive
408,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** I went into the theatre unsure of what to expect, having read a mix of rave reviews and critical maulings. I walked out nothing short of blown away. As a big budget and big effects blockbuster, Avatar delivers and then some. Great action, spectacular effects and stunning visuals of scenery, communities and machines. I also loved the many subtle touches afforded by the 3D rendering that lent an added sense of realism to the imaginary jungle on Pandora.As a story, Avatar excels. Yes, it has the formulaic qualities expected of an action-fuelled Blockbuster ... extraordinary hero, super amazing daring stunts, love story, conflict, a point of self-awareness in which defining decisions must be made, and that feel-good sense of ""YES!!"" as the story lines resolve themselves and the baddies get their just deserts. Yes, these Hollywoody elements are improbable. But it's a fantasy sci fi, and fantasy is improbable by definition. However, as expected of James Cameron, there is so much more for those who wish to engage below the surface as he revisits his theme of man's preoccupation with technology.In the Terminator movies, Cameron ably provided us with a retelling of the old Hebrew Golem tale. Avatar poignantly examines the west's longstanding habit of treating technologically-driven military superiority as superior cultural worth. Here, Cameron references the west's realistic historical tendency to use this ideological devaluing of cultures it labels ""primitive"" as an excuse to behave like savages towards them. However, this movie is not a commentary on the past, but of America's recent continuation of such spiritually devoid behaviour. In doing so, he draws an unavoidable parallel ... if the invasion and destruction of cultures for profit was arrogant and evil in the past, as most of us agree these were, then how can exactly the same kind of ideologically-driven, pre-emptive invasion of countries to gain control of their valuable natural resources be any less so today? Whether one agrees with Cameron's condemnation of neo-conservative policies or not, one function of art is to force us to ask questions about our state of humanity. And in this sense, Avatar functions very well as a work of narrative art.I feel compelled to comment on some of the criticisms I have read. They seem to wholly overlook this underlying message of the story, as though these critics somehow never looked past the 3D effects. As a PhD student, I've observed often enough that those who assume themselves to be the smartest person in the room tend not to be, and the smartest people in the room tend to assume that everyone is just as intelligent as they are. As a movie buff, I'm all to aware of those that dismiss any blockbuster as brainless based on their own self-ascribed intellectual superiority. The criticisms I've read adhere to these ideas. The critics, few though they thankfully seem to be, seem to be so busy patting themselves on the back over how clever they are that they've failed to be at all intelligent.Quite simply, this is a superb movie, visually and contextually. If you love blockbusters, go see this movie. If you love intelligent movies, give this one a chance and judge it by your own standards and movie-going tastes.",positive
409,My review is going to be short and sweet. I got out of the theatre 30 minutes ago and Im still in a stupor about the movie I have just seen.This movie connects with the audience in a way that no other movie has. Near the middle and end of the movie I felt an emotional connection with the characters. That has NEVER happened to me with any movie I have ever seen. All I can say about this movie is that it is a must see and a must have. I know that as soon as it is released I will be buying a copy and watching it a couple times over.I know that my review was short but I hope it gets a couple more people to see the movie because it is worth the money.,positive
410,"On the distant forest moon of Pandora, the giant blue-colored native, the na'vis, resist the human militarized corporation who wants to exploit the precious metal in the ground of a planet. A group of scientist lead by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who are able to download their mind into human-na'vi hybrid called avatars, are charged to find a diplomatic solution before the forces of Colonel Miles Quarich (Stephen Lang) takes charge. Joining the team following the death of his twin brother is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a former marine who is now paraplegic.Not counting the various documentaries he was involved with, ""Avatar"" is James Cameron's first cinematic outing since his 1997 box-office behemoth ""Titanic"". Was it worth the wait? Absolutely though it is also displays some serious flaws.So let's start with the weak point of ""Avatar"": the story. Not that it is bad. Actually, compared to the plot-hole ridden joke of a script that serves as a lame excuse for a story in most contemporary blockbusters, it is really good, with solid characters. But it is also wholly unoriginal and extremely predictable. Basically, if you have seen ""Dances with wolves"" or ""The last samurai"", you know what will happen in ""Avatar"" (the comparison with ""Dances with wolves"" notably is almost impossible to avoid given that the na'vis are obviously patterned over native Americans. Inspirations from ""Jurassic Park"", Peter Jackson's version of ""King Kong"", as well as Cameron's own ""Aliens"" can also be spotted here and there). This is made even worse by a tendency to phone in most of the plot development. When a na'vi tells Jake that only 5 times in the history of her people has a particularly fearsome monster been tamed, you know that Jake will tame one later, which allows you to predict how the story should unfold. The same way, once the same character tells Jake some action he is taking before the climatic battle is useless, you know exactly how the said battle will unfold. Story wise, ""Avatar"" reserves no surprise: You know what you're going to get way before it actually happens on the screen.Also, in order to better hammer his new-wavy ecological anti-militaristic message (it's worth noting that given the current concerns about climate change, ""Avatar"" could not have been released at a better time as it seems to perfectly capture the current pro-environment zeitgeist), the world of ""Avatar"" is depicted in a way that does not allow any shade of grays: You have bad evil people on side and good pure ones on the other and they don't mix! The brute force of the military walking hand in hand with rich corporate sleezeballs, both aimed at destruction, one for the sheer joy of it, the other for greed and profit vs. humanistic scientists and pure natives aimed at preserving a way of life in harmony with the environment.This could have destroyed any other movie. But sometimes it is not the story you're telling, it is how you tell it. Pushing the technological envelope on the level of computer-generated environment and motion-captured, the movie is a triumph of epic storytelling unseen since at least the last installment of the ""The lord of the rings"". The incredibly detailed and beautiful landscape of Pandora, exploding with brightly colored exotic plants and animals, make for an incredibly immersive experience. And of course, the amazing motion capture technology takes to a new level the foundations laid by Peter Jackson with Gollum in ""The lord of the rings"" and by ILM with Davy Jones and his crew in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead men's chest"" in terms of integration of real actors with digital characters. While most of the time, all the characters on screen are computer generated, we never have the impression to watch a cartoon, thanks notably to the amazing amount of emotion their faces are able to express. Some scenes are absolutely exhilarating (notably the flight scenes and the reveal of the hanging mountains). Moreover, ""Avatar"" serves as a healthy reminder that James Cameron is one of the best action director alive, and that all the Michael Bay in the world could take some lessons for him.I saw the movie in 3D but I'm not sure how much it contributed to the immersive experience that was ""Avatar"". This is the second movie in 3D that I saw after ""Coraline"" and I overall don't share everybody's enthusiasm for this format. After 30 minutes, I usually forget about the 3D, if not for the strain on my eyes, although it is possible the 3D effect mmight still play at an unconscious level to make the movie more immersive. But I overall doubt it and, for me at least, the 3D does not add much: I'm sure ""Avatar"" would have been just as enthralling in 2D.A masterpiece of epic storytelling that even its cliché and unsurprising story could not bring down and a new landmark in digital movie-making, ""Avatar"" is without a doubt the best blockbuster to hit the screen since hobbits roamed Middle-Earth. Welcome back, Mr. Cameron. We missed you!",neutral
411,"The special effects are stunning (especially in 3D). The story is about some brave mining entrepreneurs on the faraway planet of Pandora who battle tremendous odds to harvest the planet's abundant natural resources. The hardships they face include attacks by the ""Na'vi"" a violent cult of xenophobic religious fanatics. Sigourney Weaver is well cast as an evil scientist who cynically brainwashes an idealistic but naive young marine (Sam Worthington) into betraying his comrades. The film unflinchingly explores the base ignorance and hate of the Na'vi for the human immigrants who are struggling to make a new life for themselves in a foreign land. The battle scenes are stirring but the ending is very sad. I wish the good guys had won.",positive
412,"James Cameron is now finally back after 12 years in solitude, with a new stunning cinema experience not only perfect in every aspect a movie can be, but it is also shown to us in 3D (3D for this movie is Mandatory, it elevates your experience tenfold). To begin with, a story which is flawless, visualized in the best possible way, actors who play their roles with a personal best, the character development is great, you really are taken in by them and after 2 hours it feels like you're a part of this epic adventure. The soundtrack provided by James Horner is the best I've heard for many many years, if not even the best. The digital effects too are flawless, when they told us this will take CGI to a whole new level, they weren't kidding.Focusing on the story and such, I loved the way they showed us the humans. They didn't have any super-über-spacey laser cannons or something like it, and they had to take years to travel there. The gunships too were pretty realistic. propelled, not equipped with a fancy super-jet-engine-like-in-star wars. The aspect of the humans and their technology wasn't exaggerated, and I find that good, since I'm tired of Star wars and lasers and plasma guns and light speed and force fields and God knows what.The first part was a bit boring though, like the first 30-40 minutes when the introduction to everyone is made, but after that it starts climbing upwards, and believe me, the ascension doesn't stop. I don't know words to describe this movie. Perfect, flawless. An even greater masterpiece made by James Cameron. He knows how to make the crowd love all the characters, good or bad, and how to make a movie exciting, detailed and fortunately, how to make good sequels.I know a few whiners that told me this movie suck, and such people is the kind who always have to find something to complain about, like if their opinion would look more professional if they didn't like it. 8.8 is a fact. top #24 is also a fact. Don't listen to these people, at least the rest of the world loved it ;)I'm heartbroken for the scale is just 1-10, I would have given this 15 if I could. 10/10",positive
413,"Avatar was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen! Maybe the best one! It lasted for 3 hours but it made me feel like it was only 1! I wish it lasted more actually.

This is so difficult to achieve in a movie specially when it's 3 hours long! Everything was just so well made,the characters, the different places.. Just so beautiful! I am just so happy that I got to see such a gorgeous movie.congratulations for this production... I could see this movie over and over again! I recommend it to everyone..",positive
414,"So, finally, I have watched AVATAR and with it, all the anticipation, expectations end.And believe me, all that deafening publicity campaign had not been for nothing. The movie gives you everything you expect and more. After the release, I read some reviews stating that the story is not new and not high on emotional content. I would say that, though, the story is not something out of the blue and is somewhat predictable but its not bad, in fact its very good. The mega publicity revealed everything, people knew the key points of story in advance and that is why such negative things were felt and said by a few.AVATAR is a very good science-fiction which combines in its story, science and spirituality to present before us, a truly spectacular picture. The CGI effects are mind-blowing and would not let you blink your eyes. I felt slight pain in my eyes after 45 minutes or so as I was trying to behold the beauty of Pandora and in order straining my eyes. I am sure this happened with most of the viewers.The Na'vis created with the help of motion-capture technology looked more real than the human beings. Neytiri(female Na'vi, played by Zoe Saldana) in particular, looked incredibly sexy. The fantastic 3D, sometimes makes you feel as if the fauna shown is in real moving before you. The first half is dedicated to the exploration of Pandora and the romance between Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) and Neytiri. Jake Sully is assigned to learn the native ways and persuade them to move to different place as it contains rich deposits of a mineral Unobtanium which is the reason humans are there. The natives are not ready to buzz off as in that place, their most sacred tree is there. This leads to a war between the corporation and the natives. Jake Sully joins natives' side and leads them against humans. The action sequences are great with some hand-to-hand combat scenes being fantastic.In performance, Stephen Lang tops in his role of a military commander followed by Sigourney Weaver. Sam Worthington once against gets a big film with not much to do in human form, most of the things he does in AVATAR form. Others also provide good support.Music by James Horner is superb and aids the film very well.But, the most astounding work is done by the CGI effects team which has given never-seen-before visuals.And above all, the man responsible for all this sensational work is the one who gave us films like Terminator2 and Titanic, the greatest films of their times. James Cameroon has proved that such a long waiting was worth waiting for. With regard to the ongoing climate discussions, the movie doesn't preaches anything but conveys its message subtly that we have been responsible for all the nonsense happening to Earth which needs to be understood by our so called superpowers and world leaders.AVATAR is for fantasy lovers and fantasy lovers should not try to review it. Another thing, the sensuality of Neytiri indicates that after some time computer generated characters might replace human actors.Finally, AVATAR is a must watch and must in 3D only.",positive
415,"Like I said in the title, I wish I could say I enjoyed this, but I honestly didn't, I was so excited to watch this film for the first time, at the end I was so disappointed, it started off too quickly and I had no idea what was going on, the only reason I gave this 6* is because the middle was good and interesting, which is surprising, the ending dragged more than the middle, that should not be the case, I think the film itself was too long, nearly 3 hours long, I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep! I know this is just my opinion, I know loads of people love this film, but I didn't, maybe if I rewatched I might enjoy it more, but I won't be rushing to rewatch anytime soon",neutral
416,"Yes, the special effects were impressive - but they just went on too long. The first segment, where she was teaching him about Pandora, had some magnificent effects, but I really did not need 20 minutes to get the point. Then, the first ""war"" although horrible enough in its unreasonable ferocity of modern war power against the natives with only arrows and spears was followed up with another one, even more horrible, purely for the sake of the special effects. I was holding my ears and closing my eyes, the mass destruction of these wonderful people was all too close to the American destruction of the native American Indians, with all its destructiveness. There was no character development, the acting was so simplistic, the plot formulaic, the dialog trite and simple.I wanted to like this film, but was ready to leave about half way though - and if Cameron had held to a disciplined directing mode it would only have been half as long and a much better picture.",neutral
417,"I saw rather experienced AVATAR yesterday at a preview show in my city. I want to start of by saying that every once in a while there are experiences which shake us so much from within that we tend to live in them even when the moment has passed.I am not shy to admit that I am smitten by Avatar's blue Bug.Movies like Jurassic Park, Titanic, T2, Alien are the grade of movies which stay with audience or in their conception even when they are out of the multiplexes.Avatar is one such movie which adds on to the list.The excitation of having a preview show ticket and anticipation of watching something really out of the world was gripping and I was speechless along with the rest of the Audi when Mr James Cameron unleashed his splendor of Mythical characters which were totally out of bounds of anyone's imagination.I have never seen so many colors so lively on screen at once. It was so mystical and beyond conception from our minds, yet the cinematography convinced me that a world alike exists with all the blooms and primes of nature in its full flow.(Kudos to the tech team behind it) CGI and the Detailing are wondrous(The best seen till date, compared to anything seen on screen). Every Character was given its own attention and distinct presence, which really added up to the splendor which was so grand that only IMAX could have captured it in its full flow and form. Watch Avatar for what it is(though its not the best Plot supporting the best Visuals seen till date). However, 3- D's and effects do take you to almost real world which is rather Alien to us. You just cant miss SUCH a revolution on Cinema platter.I give it 9 on 10 because I don't want to end it saying that its the perfect movie ever made. Because Avatar takes the experience of movie watching to a new epitome.And Since its now widely accepted that this is a Revolution, it only makes me hungry for more of this; may be something which strikes bolt in our spines once again.I am hungry for more. Hope you listening Mr Cameron!!",positive
418,"There's a moon that's called Pandora far away, its unique flora and its fauna hold the sway, keeping everything aligned, a rooted network provides spine, but looting plunderers have plans to clear away. The indigenous in this place are called Na'vi, harmonious and peaceful and they're free, now Jake Sully has appeared, in a body that's been geared, to gain their trust and then encourage them to flee. But these folks are going nowhere and they fight, against an army with great power and great might, one for all and all for one, they must do what must be done, and hope that someone has the vision to see the light.It's a wonderfully told tale of sadness and inspiration, especially as it reflects so well the losses of so many cultures, species and environments on a planet very similar to Pandora, and all because...",positive
419,"Twelve years after coming out with ""Titanic"", the highest grossing film of all-time, James Cameron has created ""Avatar"", an absolute masterpiece. Climbing the charts by the day, Avatar has now reached second place all-time grossing nearly $US 1.15 billion worldwide and it's understandable! The movie focuses rather narrowly on a conflict between an indigenous people inhabiting a planet off in space called Pandora and corporate investors from planet Earth. In a rather personal, dramatic, and spectacularly visual way, it exposes a greed far too common here on Earth. Despite the 2.5 hour run time, there is never a dull moment. There is not even a slow moment. This production has fine tuned its focused tale to unwind perfectly. Cameron doesn't waste time with setting as we are trusted to figure out this new world on the go. Avatar is like no other movie. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the movie explores new territories. It is visually spectacular and more than lives up to its hype. Cameron's long awaited and unbelievably expensive 3-D epic drags you in from the beginning and keeps you in until the end. Unexpectedly, the movie is inspiring and with its groundbreaking special effects, it is one you don't want to miss. You have to see it to believe itand even then, it is still hard to take it all in. Including such themes as environmental destruction, war and corporate corruption and even a love affair between two blue-skinned aliens which is surprisingly romantic and affecting, all in the context of a sci-fi adventure story. The movie is set in 2154 and revolves around a paralyzed man, Jake Sully. Following his brother's death, he is selected to the Avatar program to take his brother's place. He is taken to Pandora, a beautiful destination where the nabi population resides. The humans have genetically bred human-nabi hybrids known as Avatars. The more time he spends with the nabi population, the more attached Sully gets to them and will have to choose what side he is on --- the humans or the nabis?",positive
420,"To be honest, I didn't really know what to expect of Avatar, thinking I'd get along to it sometime and not knowing much about it, but got pulled to the cinema by my kids. Well, I was absolutely blown away. My first words after it finished were: ""Great, fantastic and quite possibly the best sci-fi movie of all time."" It really is that good and that technically advanced that it raises the bar - not by increments but a whole lot.I might get to a more detailed review and Cameron's use of themes he's used in his past sci-fi like Aliens and The Abyss, his cipher characterisation, but that's just nit-picking detail. This is a complete tour-de-force and there's been nothing like it for its richness and complexity of detail. Go see it in the cinema for the 3D because I don't think the flat screen can do it justice. It's utterly, utterly amazing.",positive
421,"I thought Avatar was a great visual experience and James Cameron really should be commended for all the excellent advancements he has made in CGI special effects film making here. But I thought the story was very thin on plot and really huge parts of it, all the broad strokes of the story, are very much recycled from other movies. From Pocahontas to Ferngully, a lot of children's movies have already explored the we're-the-invading-army-displacing- good-hearted-natives plot line. Why revisit this same story again? The effects make the movie worth seeing in the theatre as long as all you are looking for is fantastically advanced 3D spectacle, it's all visuals and not much on story. The acting is okay, could have used more Sigourney Weaver and it's hard to tell how good the acting is through CGI characters anyway. I can't stand Giovanni Ribisi in most of his roles and this is no exception, he annoyed me every time he was on screen.",neutral
422,"Although the movie Avatar has stunning visual effects, and beautifully imagined character relationships, the film plays out like Sci-Fi Pocahontas that essentially steals ideas from paganism and naturalism to a point that is almost a moral crime. Within the first five minutes of watching this movie I knew what to expect, it would be the same as any other ""Protect the Homeland"" type of movie ever. Furthermore, the names of objects and locations sound as if they were imagined by a five-year-old. A element named Unobtanium, and a living center called ""Hometree"" were only two of these. Gratuitous action kept this movie interesting, in between the horribly annoying dialog between characters... Interactions seemed overly predictable and I spent each second waiting for the next fight or flight to begin. The writing of this movie was at par.... not incredible, and not horrible... if it were not for the incredible effect to support the world imagined by the writer, Pandora and the Navii would never be considered as amazing as they are. At the end of this movie I found myself thinking: What a beautiful movie... Then i thought: I knew it. As a summary, this movie is vastly overrated, but for it's sheer beauty and excitement, I would recommend it for one's personal library.",neutral

425,"My family and I were completely blown away by this film - more, rather, a film EXPERIENCE like no other that has been in the cinema before. It was absolutely spell-binding, and especially in 3-D and shown on the largest IMAX screen in London, England. Moreovoer, my wife and I found it not only a totally gripping film experience but also to be a very emotional film and story indeed.My strongest advice to anyone wishing to see this film is this: DO NOT read anything about the film or its story before you go to the cinema. Simply, DO NOT. Instead, go the cinema with a 'blank canvas' of a mind and allow the film and its magical story to wash over you and unfold.Interestingly and throughout, I spotted how this film, in a review, could also be called ""Avatar"" meets ""A Man Called Horse"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" meets ""The Lost World"" meets ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"". That is, put simply, there is clear evidence in the film how certain cultural influences have obviously had an effect on the director James Cameron over the years. As such, he deserves all the credit and congratulations he receives for such a truly masterful work. And in a couple of months' time, the film should walk away with any number of well deserved Oscars.",positive
426,"Man I don't know where to start the story of Avatar is a long and predictable one. With all its hype of: 3D, imax, and ground breaking C.G.I. there really wasn't anything left for a decent story to be told. I'll be frank. The movie is beautiful to look at (By beautiful I mean the most: realistic, gorgeous, and imaginative visuals I have ever seen!)but is hampered by a very lame and predictable story. By the time your half way through you'll know what the movie will lead toward and probably guess the ending. So what is so bad about this story? Well I should say it isn't bad but one that we all heard somewhere before not to spoil anything but in a nutshell its somewhat like Disneys Pocahontas and Dances with wolves. Just in the future with blue aliens and not as good. Now I know the budget for this movie was a ridiculous amount what with all that groundbreaking CG; I guess one could debate they wanted to be safe and kept the story and script to formula but they could have done a better job I mean Titanic had that a story we all heard but pulled us in with its characters. This is where Avatar really fails for me as great movie the characters in the story really aren't that interesting or engaging. I didn't find myself caring about what happens to a lot of them. Some dialogue and sequences from the characters come off as more than a little cliché and at times awkward to sit through. My mind started wandering at certain parts because I wasn't immersed with the characters, or because I knew what might happen and was waiting for it to draw out. I don't know what went wrong when James Cameron the guy who wrote and directed Titanic and the first two Terminators but some re-writing in the script would of helped. Now I probably bashed this movie so much you think I hate it. Not so. As an experience it really is worth checking out for the sheer spectacle of it all. The visuals really are breathtaking to see and being the first movie in 3D (from what I know) that's good I recommend you go to the nearest imax theater to watch if it still is playing, or rent it. As a movie on its own though it really isn't worth collecting unless you want it for being so groundbreaking. The predictable story and bad character writing at times really do bring down what could of been a classic for me anyway. Especially considering its over two and half hours that is a long time to wait and watch something you know is going to happen.",neutral
427,"The most cliché ridden movie I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. This is the result of James Cameron taking the most transparent parts of proceeding Oscar winnings films, sticking them into a blender and pouring the resulting cliché milkshake onto film. It is tedious beyond belief. Within 10 minutes one can easily predict what will happen. I've seen less predictable episodes of The Brady Bunch. I wont rant about the one dimensional characters, done to death plot or the name of the mineral (unobtanium ??!?!?! hahahaha sorry), they've been covered adequately in other reviews.Let me just say pretty does not mean brilliant. Because pretty it is. However if I want pretty, I'll take a short trip to the country side. I wanted 3 hours of entertainment. Not 3 hours of staring at a rainbow.Avoid if you have a semblance of intelligence and expect artists to be creative.",negative
428,"I don't get why some people don't appreciate this movie for the masterpiece it is. It was by far the greatest cinema experience I've ever had when I saw it in IMAX 3D, and watching it at home on ultra enhanced hd is breath-taking.Everything about Avatar is stunning, a clear 10/10 for me, and in my Top 10 movies of all time alongside the likes of Lord of the Rings.The cast is perfect, especially Michelle Rodriguez who is brilliant in everything, and ultimately with Stephen Lang who delivers I think the greatest villain performance of any film I've seen. I'm so happy he's going to be in the upcoming sequels, which I'm so very excited for. Can't believe it's been 13 years since the first one, and we're finally soon getting the most anticipated sequels in history. So looking forward to them!",positive
429,"This movie was hyped. A lot. More than probably any other movie in history. This hype eventually piled up so high that the film itself could never catch up. But, shockingly enough, it came damned close to doing just that. Like Star Wars and The Matrix before it, this film marked the beginning of a new generation of visual effects, and like those films, delivers enough in other areas to leave an impression that was more than just skin deep. Despite this movie's singular flaw (the script), this cinematic titan delivered more than enough thrills to compensate for James Cameron's occasionally iffy writing.It also does something that no other film has managed to do before: it truly makes you feel like you are there, in its world, and you find yourself filled with a genuine sense of wonder as you try to take in Pandora's rich flora and fauna. The quality of the special effects has been discussed to death already, but this is the factor that anchors the film, the aspect of it that was the main source of the astronomical anticipation (other than the name ""James Cameron""). However, if visual splendor serves as this movie's anchor, then the ship is built mainly from two materials: story and acting. The story (or, more accurately, stories), though they have been told countless times before, seem to never fail to leave a mark on audiences, and the resonance of one in particular is felt almost too strongly today. The clash of science, commerce, and militarism make for some great scenes of dialogue and tension, and add a philosophical aspect to the film, especially taking the constant contrast between the human Pandora and Na'vi Pandora into account.Of course, the world of Pandora wouldn't be at all believable without characters populating it, and the actors fit their respective roles like gloves. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana work incredibly well together onscreen, and truly bring their roles to life with some of the most underappreciated performances of 2009. One final part of the movie that I feel was the most unappreciated is the soundtrack. James Horner's best yet, it combines most of the best aspects of modern orchestral scores with those of traditional tribal melodies to match the setting of Pandora, and as a result is some of the most purely beautiful music anyone who cares to download the soundtrack will ever hear. Though you only leave Pandora just under 3 hours after you arrive, Pandora will not leave you for a considerably longer period of time. While it may not have been the best film of 2009 in terms of raw quality, its emotional impact, outstanding direction, and truly spectacular eye candy easily make it one of the most entertaining.",positive
430,"I am a huge fan of James Cameron. I love all of his movies that he's directed....even this one. This movie was truly amazing. Truly! But it did have some slow scenes and sometimes I felt it was 40-50 mins too long.The story was well told...it was very different. Trying to keep it where it very real and not trying to make it so over the top where the audience just goes ""That is not the future at all."" This could happen in hundreds of years from now. Very believable stuff.The acting was fantastic. Even Michelle Rodriguize was fantastic! Every character served a purpose. No one ever felt pointless or left out. What I also liked about the movie is that even the action scenes (including fight scenes) were never overdone and it didn't try too hard to make it so action packed. Everything was just perfect...again...except the pacing.Excluding the slow pacing....this movie was fantastic. Fantastic last fight scene too! This movie is pure imagination! I hope it at least wins one Oscar. It should be nominated for 12 Oscars lol.8/10",positive
431,"2009 has been a year of soulless special effects films- Transformers 2, and GI Joe come to mind in particular. Military-centric and lacking in anything resembling a real character, it depressed me to find such emotionally cold film-making was making so much money.James Cameron is the remedy.As a director, he has often very successfully managed to balance intriguing and exciting film premises with human elements that made you care for characters- he has an amazing way of making you invest in the people he created.But Avatar, for me, represents a more mature James Cameron. In Aliens and True Lies Cameron, much like the Michael Bays of today, had a boyish fascination with weaponry and the technology of war. Now James Cameron, the man, expresses his disgust at these objects. This is NOT a worship of firepower- it is a damning indictment of it.Avatar has a story that acts as analogy for many things- colonialism, America's supposed war on terror, labelling Palestine's resistance fighters as terrorists, the human desire for profit vs the human need for environmental preservation. It is very much a product of our time, and it is hugely passionate in its execution. In my mind Avatar represents Cameron's rage.More that this, when we hear the horrified and angry screams of an invaded population, we hear our own frustration. The film had me in tears at some points, because of the clarity and resonance of its message.The film is not all doom and gloom- it is inspiring also. It demonstrates there exist universal principles that transcend race or allegiance of country, it celebrates spirituality, and abhors the arrogance of men and their guns. There were moments when the film gave me goosebumps.Please see this film if it feels like the world around you doesn't always show the humanity you feel it should, if you don't understand why people's lives are so expendable in the pursuit of oil, land or empty victory. It is a strangely validating experience to find so many of your feelings so poetically reflected. Thank you Mr Cameron.",positive
432,"OK first of all let me state...James Camron has made some of the best movies of the 20th century in my opinion. Aliens, The Terminator 1 and 2 Titanic, all of which are great movies. So I'm not here to bash Camron or his work. But I was less than impressed with Avatar.Perhaps the over hyping of this movie made me watch it with higher expectations that I should have had. Perhaps impossible expectations. But none the less. One thing about this movie that irked me right away was the recycled sound effects...A movie of this SIZE and SCALE used recycled sound effects? Many of the animals encountered in this movie sound exactly like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. The animation of everything was good...But it didn't blow me away like I hoped it would.Now the bad...The story...So unoriginal I almost couldn't stand it. It has this overwhelming ''save the earth'' message to it which I would rather not have crammed down my throat. It also reminds us that we ''Human beings'' are the aids of planet slowly and methodically killing the earth. Story alone gets a 2/10 score for me.Overall I can't rate this movie any higher than 5/10. I wish that I could. But I just wasn't as impressed by at is I felt I should have been.",neutral
433,"Landing at the convergence point between the advent of uncanny CGI capabilities and the peak of the 3D movie revival, Avatar was the right film at the right time to reap a swath of popular rewards. For one season in 2009, it seemed like everyone in the world was going to see this movie. Often more than once. It's the type of cultural lightning most mainstream filmmakers dream of bottling, then spend the rest of their careers chasing. Writer / director James Cameron showed tremendous foresight (and maybe an awful lot of luck) in waiting for the right moment to unleash his vision, having conceived the basic idea a decade earlier, and now may be showing a tremendous lack of the same in scheduling four very-belated sequels. But that's beside the point. For now, the future of this franchise remains unwritten and I'm just here to assess the ground level.As plots go, the first Avatar entry is simplistic and naïve. We see the glaring character archetypes for what they are, right away, and the blanks essentially fill themselves. The mean, self-centered industrial types can never understand the unspoken bond their mindful, tribal counterparts share with the land. Greed imposes upon empathy, inciting armed conflict. It's essentially a Captain Planet episode. Shades of gray pepper both sides of the argument, so there is a bit more depth here than in a Saturday morning cartoon, but not much. It's entry-level writing, establishing a rudimentary threat and then working loose suspense until the third act. Avatar's storyline will neither surprise nor enlighten, but that's not what sold the show, anyway.The film's real strength is in its knack for attentive world-building and its celebration of bright, colorful artistic representation. If this didn't look like it does, teem with life as it does, exploit the 3D craze as effectively as it does (Or as it did? Does anyone still watch 3D movies?), it wouldn't have landed with a fraction of the magnitude it once did. Its affinity for bright color and unusual hues, almost completely foreign in the cinematic language of the time, might be its most influential feature. Certainly, the creative minds behind Guardians of the Galaxy took notes and continued the trend. And the alien landscape of Pandora is exhaustively developed and realized. It buzzes, both literally and metaphorically, with biology. When the protagonist is staggered by his first exposure to the local fauna, we're staggered right alongside him. In this sense, it often feels like the cart has lapped the horse; like the storyline took a third-row seat behind the tantric urge to flesh everything out. So, while the spectacle of watching that six-legged, gill-breathing equine critter live and move is absolutely magical, its actual role in the story is limited to... er... living and moving for a few slow-paced scenes. After that, it's background fodder. The same is true of almost everything else on the map. There's an abundance of dazzling creativity, but no great underlying substance beyond the ""hey, we're all like, connected, maaan"" mumbo-jumbo. We're mesmerized by the beasts' intrinsic majesty, but any meaning we might take beyond the superficial is purely viewer-appointed. It's a billion-dollar tech demo, a wonderful place to dwell and take inspiration, nothing more and nothing less.And hey, that's not the end of the world. Sometimes it's okay to cast aside a deeper meaning and a richer cast in favor of a different set of features. I love non-narrative art films like Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. However, the trouble with relying so completely upon this brand of visual fidelity and computer imagery is, eventually, those bills come due. And, while Avatar's trees and airborne jellyfish and spinning, glowing lizard thingies have weathered the past thirteen years marvelously, its blue humanoid representatives are already showing their age. And those guys chew a vast majority of the screen time. As they continue to degrade, so does the associated movie magic, leaving audiences with a meager, barebones plot for sustenance. That just isn't a recipe for success. This felt thin but spectacular in the theater, but now? It's fading. How will it look in another thirteen years? How will the sequels?",neutral
434,"Avatar is James Cameron's science fiction epic that has broken the mold for movie making. For years we have been hearing great things about the progress and set backs for this film. Since 1997, Cameron has yet to release a feature length film, excluding some of his work with IMAX and his documentary/3D films like Ghosts of the Abyss. 12 years after he broke all of the box office records with Titanic, the most successful film of all time, Cameron has come back with a bang. A big bang. Possibly the biggest bang in cinema history.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic Marine, is sent to a distant planet to follow up in his brothers footsteps. The planet is Pandora. A world filled with strange, magnificent fauna and flora. It's a world filled with vibrant colors, breathtaking landscapes, and a tribe of intelligent life called the Na'vi. Underneath their village lies a rich deposit of a very rare and profitable metal. In order to avoid a hostile takeover, the military has permitted Dr. Grave Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her Avatar program to try and persuade the locals through education, compromise, and good will that they are not to be feared. The program takes the DNA from the Navi and humans and combines them to create Avatars. These Avatars allow those whose DNA is in the Avatar to plug in andDr. Augustine's science department is at wits end with Colonel Miles Quatrich (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), the forces driving the drilling and military presence. They share one thing in common; an interest in Jake Sully. Sully and has his hands in both pots. He is the only person who can operate his brother's Avatar and he has an obligation to serve his military superiors. Sully is put in the difficult situation of making contact with the Na'vi and giving information to both Dr. Augustine and to Colonel Quatrich.I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot and the characters. That was the one part of the movie I wasn't too excited about at the onset of the film, but as the story played out, I became more and more involved and grew to accept and understand the story. It sounds and looks almost too ridiculous, but trust me, it works.I have seen a lot of science fiction movies. I have seen a lot of 3D movies. Never before have I seen a movie like this before. The clarity in the depth of vision Cameron creates is astounding. A friend of mine compared it to looking through a window, rather than the movie popping out of the screen towards you. I couldn't agree more. Needless to say, Cameron waited just the right amount of time to make this one.What make the visuals so outstanding is the attention to detail on each individual effect. Everything from the mountains and tree tops in the background all the way through the foreground is so clear and detailed. It's astounding! From the very first moments of the film when Sully is lying down and water droplets surround him, every scene has something to wow the audience.The cast has a wide variety of actors, the biggest of which is Weaver. I expected a solid performance from her but I was surprised by Worthington, whose only screen credit I had seen prior to this was Terminator: Salvation. Lang and Ribisi too give excellent performances. Even Michelle Rodriguez does a fine job. The actors that we can't see, like Zoe Saldana and Wes Studi, do a fine job as some of the the Na'vi leads.I felt a certain enjoyment that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was like watching Batman or Jurassic Park again for the first time. A kind of thrill that you experience on a roller coaster. There is so much to fall in love with here. I would have no problem saying that this is the best movie of the year. It's almost in a class of it's own. Avatar is the dawn of a new age in cinema. Where we are not bound by the constraints of technology. It's proof that if you can dream it, you can do it. James Cameron sought out to create a mesmerizing, groundbreaking film and he accomplished just that and more. The doubters who thought he would fall on his face are now the ones picking themselves off of the ground.The future looks bright for big budget movies. With this new technology and new way of story telling, audiences can expect more high quality entertainment. James Cameron goes all in with each movie he makes. His next movie is called Battle Angel, another futuristic tale about a female cyborg rescued by a scientist. Sounds crazy. I can't wait.",positive
435,"I suppose the big selling point behind this movie was the special effects, and this film doesn't shy away from getting in your face with some of the most beautiful and amazing images I have ever seen.The amount of detail and love that went into the visuals is just outstanding. The scenery, the creatures, the Navi, wow!! If you see this movie, see it for the visuals.Now if only Cameron had put the same amount of care into the scriptThe plot for this movie seemed to borrow from a number of sources, the two standouts being Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas. I must defend Cameron, as it extremely hard to be 100% original these days, as most ideas have been used time and time before.Nevertheless, the plot weakened the overall viewing experience. I had a feeling I knew how the movie was going to end. And the movie went for a bit too long; unnecessary points in the plot could have saved the studios a LOT of money.But in the end, the goods outdo the bads. Avatar's visuals are a good enough reason to see this film, even if the film is more of a ""look what we can do"" piece rather than a piece of storytelling.",neutral
436,"What else can you say about James Cameron's Avatar than ""wow?"" The visuals are stunning and lead to a feeling of complete immersion incomparable to anything seen in the last decade. Ten years and hundreds of millions of dollars in the making, this film marks a culmination of technologies—the 3D experience and computer generated imagery. The last decade has seen visual effects dominated by computer created phantasmagorias which have led to greater flexibility in terms of directorial license and story-telling possibilities. Shots heretofore unheard of are becoming common-place, as the computer generated world of Pandora clearly demonstrates.Within moments of the opening shot, Avatar makes it clear that this will be a movie where the envelope has not only been pushed, but stamped, put in the mail, and delivered to a zip code on the other side of the galaxy. Minutes into the movie we as viewers are dropped into the jungles of Pandora and land in a quasi-military installation where a vast nameless corporation has set up a group of scientists and mercenaries to quell the native Na'vi. All of this is vast expense is undertaken to mine a mineral of unknown property which nevertheless sells for (presumably) incredible sums. (According to the movie ""twenty-million,"" but with the economy the way it is and inflation over the next hundred and forty years, who knows?)Into this world is thrust our protagonist who is recruited to replace his (deceased) scientist brother on the Avatar Project. This is the brainchild of Dr. Grace Augustine (played by sci-fi legend and Cameron alumna Sigourney Weaver) who wishes to establish a repertoire with the natives by infiltrating their alien culture with artificially grown avatars, combinations of human and Na'vi DNA that look a lot like their human ""drivers,"" but are nevertheless blue skinned and pointy-toothed Na'vi.The plot is pretty straightforward. Good guy discovers an affinity with the natives, uncovers a plot by the evil corporation (in this case their proxy, the mercenary commander played by Stephen Lang), teams up with the bows-and-arrows-wielding natives and through sheer willpower defeats the corporation. Through all of this the viewer is treated to a new world, a wholly invented (and quite inventive) ecology and population rendered in stunning detail that never fails to delight.None of these plot points are particularly novel and the specific details of foreshadowing are blatant enough that a conscientious viewer will at some point realize what will happen in ten or twenty minutes. But the spectacle of it makes these deficiencies less glaring than they could be. In fact, so engrossing is the movie that even when I noticed the narrative problems, I promptly dismissed them so I could settle back into the movie.Of particular interest though, is the way in which humanity is portrayed in this movie. Much ink has been spilled over the imperialist designs on Pandora, and the ham-handed way in which Cameron seems to pursue that theme; often these same complaints are addressed in the same paragraph as the very real criticism that Cameron lacks the characterization and plot depths that would make this a truly epic movie. To address those concerns, as a narrative, this is a plot driven story. That's all. As to the other complaints, a story like this must skimp on developing character in order to further its aim. Would you root for the underdog as heartily by the end if you had grown to love—or at least empathize with—several tangential characters soon to be killed in the uprising? Indeed, once the antagonist has been revealed as less the demon and more a human being driven by impulses and urges and rationalities that perhaps you even agree with, he loses your hatred. Military and political leaders throughout history have known this one simple fact, employed ably by storytellers: You must hate a man to kill him. Or in the case of Avatar, you must hate the antagonist to cheer for the protagonist.Similarly, when examining the anthropomorphous Na'vi I couldn't help but notice the references to the exploitation of the Indigenous American Population by American colonists (of many nationalities) and later the United States. Neither I, nor any of the sons of our fathers, can speak for the intentions of our fathers; we live with the consequences of their actions. Yet, we can learn from them. To this James Cameron seems most intent in the telling of his story. It is, in fact, the central theme.Innately we sense that it is unjust for the powerful to tread upon the powerless; it is a theme that echoes strongly with us, as cruelty seems often to have been perpetrated upon the weaker by the stronger. This feeling of injustice makes it easier to sympathize with, and then cheer for, the Na'vi uprising that eventually ousts humanity from Pandora.It is from this and themes like it that stories derive their power, for stories are the object lessons of morality, teaching us the value of justice, honor, love and hope. More than simply lessons, however, justice triumphing over the wicked, of love and honor victorious against violence and greed are tales which transcend their genre and medium. They resonate throughout history, reminding us of our place in the world, and of our place amongst ourselves. They are the myths that are told around fires, passed from mouth to mouth in an unbroken succession until they become legends placed on canvas screens suddenly rendered in depth by a brush made not of horse or camel hair but the digital wizardry of pixels and bits.But regardless of where and when they are told, it is the skill of the storyteller that paints pictures most vivid in our minds and allows them to transcend the bounds of time and resonate with us again. With Avatar, James Cameron has demonstrated that he is such a storyteller.",positive
437,"There's nothing new, and original, about this Pocahontas look a like, sci- fi movie. Of course beside, the Visual effects, the Sound, and the Art/set direction. That is worth the experience, and money well spent. Because, the whole experience, of the movie, is great it self. But there's nothing new about this movie, if you have seen a action/sci-fi or two, you would know, what will happened, and who will win. (Good VS. Evil). It's story, is simple, it's almost like Pocahontas, beside Pocahontas dose not take place, in a planet called Pandora. Worth watching, because of it's great visual effects, but will be forgotten, when a newer movie, with better effects, will take over.",positive

How did James Cameron's depiction of aliens degrade so much since the 80's? If you're gonna spend this much money to make a movie hire someone to write a non-laughable and at least reasonably original script? Or why bother, because plenty of people seemed to eat it up...Unobtainium? really? You couldn't think of a made up name for your space metal that you had to call it unobtainium? Whats worst of all, I have to wake up each day and come to terms that I live in a world where complete and utter crap like this is passed off as a good movie.",negative
439,"OK I went to see Avatar but I didn't expect what was coming. Story was perfectly executed, visuals simply amazing and I just can't find anything bad about Cameron's latest work. I've found out about it about 6 months back, no I'm not a fanboy. I wasn't particularly hyped neither. Saying that...This is most likely the best movie I've seen in my whole life. It has everything and more. There has to be a continuation, or ideally Cameron should make a trilogy. It's just so good 2 hours 40 minutes spent on watching it felt like an hour. It doesn't matter what movies you like, whether you enjoy watching sci-fi or not - you just need to see it for yourself be it 2 or 3D and you won't believe how good it is.",positive
440,"I went to see both the IMAX and the non-IMAX 3D versions one after the other today and I say that IMAX 3D is really the best. IMAX is more 3D than the other. It probably is because of the screen size and the projection power. When you are sooo into the movie you forget that you are looking at a screen (the boundaries disappear). In the meeting scene where the Colonel was telling the attendees about the build up of Na'vis, I felt like I was there myself. (This maybe a spoiler alert) Now the movie. After this movie, the movie academy should already add new award categories like Best CGI Character (Male) and Best CGI Character (Female), etc.",positive
441,"There are many opinions on Avatar. There are clearly believers, and fierce critics. The mere fact that so many people are talking about it, including myself, must mean that it struck a note with the masses. Any publicity is good publicity after all, no?Hmmm - Avatar. As many of you I had very high expectations, and to be perfectly honest, I was not disappointed. The execution is flawless and the visuals are stunning and mesmerising. The subtlety of the 3D makes it stand apart from the traditional Disney World 'jump in your face' sequences. There is however a small leap of faith to be made, and as pointed out correctly by many critics of the movie, the story is not really original. It has been told before, it is predictable, but then aren't all stories derived from an older version? There are only so many stories to tell and I can compare most 'original' movies to an obscure predecessor.If you let yourself be swept away by it, and ignore the 'intellectually superior' attitude that blocks you from seeing past the simplicity, you are in for a beautifully crafted love story, good vs. evil in its most basic form. Only this time it has a twist: the new technology allows you to be sucked into the story, but you have to be able to let go and enjoy the ride.If you would read the script of Star Wars before it was visually realised by George Lucas, you might have concluded the story was somewhat childish. And now this is heralded as one of the best movies of all times. It was visually spellbinding for its time, withstood the test of time, and all that with a simple and naive storyline we all came to love and cherish. What makes Avatar so different from this? Not much. The story is simple and stripped of all unnecessary character development to give the viewer an 'experience', 'an emotional feeling', and on that level, it is unsurpassed in beauty and sensitivity. It will have many teenagers look back with happy thoughts in their thirties of the time they saw Avatar on the big screen.Well done James Cameron for bringing us something old (that works) but presented in a way that is simply revolutionary. Kudos to you for writing the story yourself although it is not your forte. Lord of the Rings was the last time I was wowed, and a lot of that was the combination of story and groundbreaking visuals. But let's not forget that it was based on a great book, Star Wars nor Avatar are, which makes them - in my opinion - slightly more original. Did you ever wonder what LOTR would have looked like with Cameron at the helm?Finally, this movie is revolutionary and I starkly disagree with people who say it is not. Blaming the studios for substituting a good story with use of expensive technology and expensive special effects is a dated excuse. The technology is here to stay, and James Cameron has opened the road for many directors/screenwriters to take advantage of this technology as the studios are probably queing up now the business case has proved the investment to be a luctrative. Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg are already lined up for making movies using this very same technology - so to all people unhappy with the story - scripts with more depth are bound to come.Maybe not the greatest story, but one of the best cinematic experiences since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.I tell everyone: go see it without prejudice, and you might just LOVE it. I did ...",positive
442,"It seems whatever film James Cameron is involved in, it's always breathtaking, i mean what with his history of amazing films such asThe Terminator 1 & 2: Judgement Day Aliens Titanicand now he has created a film, that had so much of a buzz it became the queen bee of films, named AvatarAvatar which uses special cameras and exploits the use of 3D technology to create a spectacle of a film, honestly, when i watched Avatar in 3D, the only thing in my mind was....Completely Freaking Amazing!The Storyline is not some sort of massive, other-world, freaky, killing film, it takes a simple storyline of infiltration into ones nest and using its information for personal use but end up failing because the person that was sent to do it completely forgot about it and became a member of the family and didn't want anything bad to happen to it.Now i know it looks like such a massive storyline and the timing (over 2 hours) seems like it will last forever, but this film makes those 2 hours so spectacular you would wish it was going on for 5 hours. James Cameron was in Mr. Out Of This World for this film as it takes cinema to a whole new level.This film you MUST see, i would recommend to watch it in 3D FOR SURE, but if your happy with 2D still watch it & if you fail to watch it you ABSOLUTELY have to obtain it on DVD!! This is a MUST SEE!!Avatar - A*",neutral
443,"There is a fundamental error in Avatar, which director James Cameron refused to see when making the movie. The world of Pandora is brilliant and original indeed, but in no way does it justify alone an almost three hour movie. True art in cinema is rare and it combines a multitude of components such as storyline, character development, mise en scene, music score etc. Cameron focuses 100% in the technical part of the film-which is undoubtedly excellent and innovative-and deliberately neglects everything else. If one accepts that Avatar is a sci-fi adventure with no brains whatsoever, then he will have a great time watching it, but if one enters the world of Pandora with expectations of anything more than that, then he will be very disappointed. No problem here, except we are talking about Cameron, director of The Abyss and Titanic. Those movies had the technical brilliance of their age, but in the same time had everything else. Who can forget Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio calling for Ed Harris on the walkie as he descents in the dark depths of the ocean or Kate Winslet whispering in the cold and endless waters as she gazes Leonardo Di Caprio vanishing in the dark beneath her, while, just feet away, the titanic makes its final voyage to oblivion. Even when Arnold Schwarzeneger gives his mechanical life to save Eduard Furlog and Linda Hamilton. All these are moments that defined a filmic genre and an age of cinema. Unfortunately, in ten years time, we will still remember these moments, while all of Avatar will be lost...like tears in the rain...",neutral
444,"I had a feeling that this movie was going to be good, but seeing it now...I really can't describe how I feel about it. I can just simple say that I am in love with this movie. The visual effects are astounding. I would honestly say watch the movie in 3D, it helps you get a better feel of what you are seeing and feeling.The emotion in the movie is amazing, it's almost like what they feel is exactly what you will feel. This movie didn't just change my perspective on movies, because it really is the greatest movie of all time, it changed my perspective on life itself. The feeling that our world takes everything for granted, and in their world they respect everything. Look at everything on there planet as if it is sacred. Because in reality, everything is sacred.They cherish the lives of there people and everything else around them. They give thanks for everything, and even the things they've killed they pass them on with respect and love. Giving them the space to move on into the next life so peacefully. It's amazing how much our world before all the greed and money use to be so similar to that. I don't know about anyone else, but this movie changed my life perspective.It is a must see, I promise you won't regret it. I will be watching this movie until the day I die.",positive
445,"Well the hype for this movie was unbelievable with headlines buzzing ""12 years in the making"", and ""1000's of man hours go into just minutes of this movie"" etc. It was without doubt a very well marketed movie, because I certainly got sucked in being that it was literally everywhere here in the U.K.Still, James Cameron's goal is admirable. Where critics commented he was doomed to fail by making ""Titanic"" (1997), he managed to do very well albeit including a romantic subplot. ""Avatar"" definitely succeeds in the effects department, as it is without question one of the most beautifully CGI rendered worlds I've ever seen. Taking the novelty of 3-D (Usually being a method where an object is coming towards you), the movie makes very good progression when using it to instead aid and give the tropical world more visual depth (Although 3-D IS still a gimmick that I think will never catch on while glasses are involved).A young paralysed soldier is drafted into the ""AVATAR"" program, to take over the role of his recently deceased brother. His job is to infiltrate a tribe of natives on the planet ""Pandora"", whose home is on top of a large mineral source where small quantities are worth millions. However, will the time he spends with the natives change and alter him? Or will he be doomed to stand aside to let the corporations harvest the jungle? The story I have to say is flawed and in some areas is of course similar to other famous movies, most notably ""Dance's with Wolves"" (1990). But I still think ""Avatar"" has enough to be entertaining. Obviously more similar remakes and reboots are getting put out every year, and already in the same year ""BATTLE OF TERRA"" seemed to be ripping off Avatar and getting away with it pretty well. As far as casting goes, everyone does a solid job be it motion captured or not. Sam Worthington is growing on me here and there, and to see Sigourney Weaver on screen again certainly brought back a lot of ""ALIENS"" (1986) nostalgia to me.Other than that, it certainly falls flat in some areas. I don't know how well to rate Cameron as I writer, but the script doesn't deliver anything particularly memorable throughout the two and a half hour flick. Of course somewhat being the first of its kind, there's always going to be a level of higher regard as a success or failure. The kid in me wanted it to win big at the Oscars that year, yet looking back ""The Hurt Locker"" more than deserved BEST PICTURE.Final Verdict: As a technical achievement, ""Avatar"" is grand and gorgeous but unfortunately can't help but be a movie full of exposition, that is just ""showing off"" how far we've come only in terms of technology. All that said though, it is an enjoyable flick, albeit a very long one that makes you wonder how refined Cameron's planned sequels will be. 7/10. It's a lot of fun.",positive
446,"Avatar was really a spectacular movie. The special effects and cg graphics were awesome! It truly reflected the five years of work and millions of dollars that went into it. The story, although not very original, was very inspiring. The story is about a marine named Jake who is paralyzed waist down. His brother died, so Jake had to take his place. Jake has to go to this planet called ""Pandora"", where the humans are in conflict with the aliens. Jake, through the Avatar project, which put him in an alien body, learned more about the aliens and started to question how justified the humans were in coming to the planet. Jake even goes as far as to fall in love with a really hot alien woman (I won't tell you who, you will have to find out). I will not ruin the ending; I will just say that Jake makes a very inspiring speech to the aliens close to the end of the movie. That was somewhat similar to William Wallace's speech to the army in the movie ""Braveheart"". The characters were well thought out, designed, and animated. The cg aliens looked very real, living and breathing. The only real downside of the movie are the unoriginal story. Otherwise the movie was purely incredible!",positive
447,"For a $237 million budget, from a Three-Time-Oscar-Winning director, the first film in years to be shot in 3D, and hype that puts the seventh Harry Potter book to shame, I expected the best film of the decade when I bought tickets for ""Avatar"". It was far from that...I don't really need many words to describe the plot. I wont use the Smurf joke as that's been overused, but I can compare this film faultlessly to ""Dances With Wolves"". An OK plot, but a bit to weak. It's something that would be aimed at the same sort of audience as The Little Mermaid... The very cliché plot was disguised with 3D cinematography. Unfortunately though, if you don't see it in 3D, it exposes what's left of the film. Which is little. Hence why a lot of people I know fell asleep whilst watching it in 2D... though some did fall asleep during the 3D version too. It's real shame, because there were some great ideas, but they weren't developed enough.However, despite a weak plot, we are provided with some good characters, which is crucial in any film. We get to see plenty of emotions and opinions in this film, which off course leads to an exciting climax. There is an on-going battle almost from the word ""go"" between the scientists and the military. These are very well developed scenarios, with a clear and believable difference between character relationships. There are no pushovers, and pushovers are very good evidence for a lazy screenwriter. Character wise, everyone is really well developed, and Cameron has kept the realism whilst drafting his characters.As far as the effects go (which is what propelled this film to the top of the Box Office) some are outstanding, others are dismal. The space craft and explosions are neat, but the CGI and Motion Captured Na'Vi are awful. The tone of them is almost mono... but a film shouldn't rely on great special effects, which unfortunately, this film does.The acting wasn't that bad either. Considering there was some awful dialogue, the actors executed it well, as did the actresses. Stephen Lang played the bent Colonel Miles Quaritch brilliantly, bringing forward a great impression of a Military Commissioned Officer.The over hype, weak plot, bad dialogue, and some disappointing CGI doesn't deserve a $3 billion gross, but that's the way the film industry ticks. I don't like to heavily criticise films, as I know the effort that goes into making them. It's definitely worth a watch, but unless you are a huge James Cameron fan, I'd rent this if I were you. (Or record it off the TV)",neutral
448,"A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look ""photo-realistic"", as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness.",neutral
449,"My first ever review on IMDb...The Odeon booklet describes this movie as a ""tent-pole"" pioneer in the 3D format used. Some screens at the multiplex were showing this movie in 2D and as far as I could determine the 3D ticket price was the same (3D specs included in price)! Why would anybody want to see this movie in 2D??Being a die-hard trekkie, I knew I'd enjoy this movie and it didn't disappoint in any area. My last experience of 3D was those multi-coloured cardboard thingies from the 80's that never really set the scene alight. This was altogether something different with solid framed specs framing an absolutely perfect 3D experience. Sure, I'd rather the recent Star Trek movie had been my first 3D Real D experience... next time.The movie? Go see it. Don't d/l an AVI or even wait for the DVD/BluRay.

I don't know whether there will be another movie in my life going to replace this movie in my pick list. No wonder Spielberg was surprised for this movie.Absoluetly stunning.I love Pandora. I love the animals in Pandora. I love Na'vi. I love the sparkling trees in Pandora. For the 2 and half hours I was in a different world which I couldn't even imagine in my lifetime not even in my dreams. I really wanted to be a dream walker to that fascinating world.The cinematography is awesome. Special effects fantastic...awesome.spellbound. You can't even imagine drawing those creatures or plants or Pandora people. Whatever we kept as desktop wallpapers it comes visual before your eyes.The performance of Sam Worthington as handicap is awesomebut he got only limited scenes to performrest of the movie is taken by the ""Pandora Jack"" breathtaking performanceNo words.Neytiri---She took my heart :).I swear you can't find ""Zoe Saldana"" in Neytiri character. Brilliant performance. She performed so well she teaches jack about their culturetacticslanguagefinally fall in love with him.Sigourney Weaver---Dr.Gracy—absolutely stunning performance...she teaches to the children of Pandora...Learn from those peopleand finally she dies for them.Eytukan—Leader of the Pandora people.I likes his patient and love towards his people. Moat, Tsu'tey, Stephen Lang & Michelle Rodriguez done their part perfect.Pandora jack performance was awesome...he learn the language of pandoras and then the tradition and culture of those people. Each and every technique handled by those Pandoras was different and beautifully portrayed.

451,"The hype was definitely big; over 10 years in the making. The ultra secret film project that would push the boundaries of film making to its limits. With that promise, a whopping budget and James Cameron's reputation on the line, ""Avatar"" was born. At the start of his career, James Cameron brought to life his nightmare about an unstoppable cyborg killer, now he has realized his vision of a beautiful dream. ""Epic"" cannot even begin to describe this marvel of a movie. It surpasses every other blockbuster that has come before. Plus it has brains and heart to boot, two things other big special effects laden movies like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen tend to forget.Much has been said about Avatar's less-than-original story. In the year 2154 on a faraway moon called Pandora, the RDA corporation has been attempting to mine precious ""unobtanium"" minerals while fending off attacks by the local ""Na'Vi"": a race of tall, blue skinned natives clearly inspired by Native Americans. Enter Jake Sully, an crippled marine who is sent to replace his brother in the ""Avatar Project"" which involves transplanting the minds of humans into artificially created Na'vi bodies in order to facilitate better inter-species understanding between Na'vi and Humans. But Jake is given new orders from the corporation; infiltrate the Na'vi tribe, learn their secrets and convince them to relocate before the military is sent in to remove them by force.Similar to his previous work on Terminator in which James Cameron took a typical horror/slasher movie structure(unstoppable killer going after helpless teenage girl)and tailored it into an all time classic, Avatar's story is, at its core, just a mix of well known cinema clichés. The story of a soldier who is taken in by some natives and ultimately fights with the natives against his former comrades is nothing new, having been done most recently in ""The Last Samurai"". But Cameron manages to bring all those familiar elements together and craft a sweeping tale that is as compelling as the world it takes place in; it is not the individual elements, but the end result mix that works so well. On the surface, it is a grand science fiction fantasy adventure that anyone can understand and enjoy. Dig beneath that surface and you have an entire cast of interesting characters as well as clever allusions about the recent war in Iraq, metaphors about corporate globalization, and even deeper philosophy about an individual's life purpose.A word of warning though: Do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch this movie unless you watch it in its full 3D glory. While most 3D films ""pop up"" in your face, Avatar does a different approach. Instead of popping out, it immerses the viewer into the visual experience with a realistic field of depth thanks to a technique of filming that mimics the way our eyes perceive distance. This revolutionary filming method makes the magnificent CGI world, creatures and characters all the more majestic to behold. Forget Star Wars, forget Lord of the Rings, AVATAR is the new benchmark of visual effects excellence. Even the more hardcore fan-boys of science fiction would be drooling at the attention to detail the production team put into fleshing out not just a never-before-seen world, but original creature designs and even an entirely new language for the Na'Vi(and let us not forget the most realistic portrayal of robotic mecha in the history of digital films). After a short while one would would forget that the Na'Vi are just digital effects and come to emotionally connect with those lovable yet tragic creatures. That is the extent of realism that the revolutionary CGI and amazing acting gives to the digitally rendered Na'Vi. The human characters are also perfectly cast and even the ""bad guys"" have a certain appeal about them. (special mention goes to Stephan Lang's character of Colonel Quaritch, easily embodying the definition of ""bad ass"" and giving ""Apocalypse Now""'s Colonel Killgore a run for his money.) While almost Flawless in its execution, only one personal nitpick would be that perhaps Avatar would have worked better with a longer running time or split into two movies. The final act where Jake goes from outcast to Na'vi savior in 10 minutes felt a little bit truncated and more time could have been spent on Jake Sully's back-story, but those are just minor nitpicks if one wanted to be really fussy.Emotionally engaging, thrilling, entertaining and breathtaking. Avatar is James Cameron at his best; showcasing his abilities as an blockbuster movie director who can balance action with emotion, bang with brain. Battles are edge-of-your-seat thrill rides, beautifully choreographed and filmed, bringing ""awesome"" to a whole new level. From start to finish, Avatar succeeds at everything it set out to do and easily lives up to the hype. Avatar is not just a film, but an entire world born from the mind of James Cameron, created from scratch and ripe with possibilities. It is an indescribable experience that one should not miss out on. Future blockbuster directors would be hard pressed to live up to the standards set by this grand modern masterpiece that would easily become an immortal classic in no time.",positive
452,"OK, so I made a first attempt at some sort of review of Avatar and failed miserably. I tried to make it sound to fancy, filled it with a bunch of crap, blah blah blah. Anyway, I have to say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen If not the best. Now, I know that is quite a bold statement but hey, I'm the kind of person to make statements like that. To a sci-fi/fantasy geek like me, Avatar was THE next big thing, the movie I waited a year for. I ordered midnight tickets to the IMAX, got there and hour early to pick out a good seat, etc. I literally sat through the movie with a huge smile on my face. Never have I felt so satisfied walking out of a movie.Now a lot of the complaints focus on weak story and weak acting. To be honest, the acting in my opinion was fine. I'm not going to say that I will bow down to Sam Worthington but all the actors did a great job, particularly Zoe Saldana. I don't know if it was their portrayal, or the way the characters were written, but I found myself actually caring for the characters. Call me cold-hearted, but I couldn't have cared less if Frodo died in Lord of the Rings. The only people I cared for in those movies were Gandlaf and Aragorn. I don't like over-emotional characters, it simply bogs down the story. In this movie, I found myself caring for the main characters, on the edge of my seat during the finale.One of the amazing things Cameron does is he has the guts to kill off nearly any character. He killed almost everyone in Aliens, everyone but the main in Terminator, and killed of poor Leo in Titanic. When characters started going in this movie, I got a little nervous for the leads. That tells me something! The fact that I was nervous for movie characters indicated to me that these were characters I truly cared about, that I wanted to live. In regards to to the story, ye sits predictable but so is everything. Originality is not in the destination always but in the journey. Just because we know the ending doesn't make the scenes leading up to it boring. I was engaged by the entire movie start to finish despite predicting what would happen.The music, although I hear it copies a lot of Horner's previous work, felt perfect to me. I consider myself I bit of a movie music snob. I believe music can either make or break a movie, its that essential. It has to provide a great ""feel"" if you know what I'm saying. Some scenes in this movie left me in awe not only with the effects but the music as well. I love the use of choir and chanting in a film's score and there was plenty here. It just made me feel as if this was truly an ""epic"" movie, I don't know how to explain it.I am not going to claim I am some movie critic and know all. I certainly don't and I am not here to analyze this film for all it's worth. I just know that a movie never made me feel this way before. I have seen it three times and I am dying to see it again. I listen to the soundtrack on an hourly basis. Hell, the IMDb page is my internet homepage and I regularly visit the Avatar Wiki. When I have left the theatre each time, I feel depressed, wishing I could see more, wishing our world was more like Pandora. I felt so connected throughout the entire movie that it was just frustrating to leave. Any movie that makes me feel this way is certainly considered by me to be one of the best movies ever. It's something I feel rather then something I can analyze. 10/10",positive
453,"When I was 10 years old, I remember seeing Terminator 2: Judgment Day in the theater. And when Arnold first saves John Connor from the T1000, I recall the vivid awareness that I wasn't just watching that Summer's action Blockbuster. It was something more. At the time, I didn't really know or understand that feeling. But years later, when I'd revisit T2 it would click into place.I wasn't watching a movie. I was watching a Dream.Across the years, I've been blessed to encounter a handful of other films that gave me that same feeling—the feeling that I could close my eyes, and awaken to a new world of distilled imagination. Blade Runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Metropolis, and Nosferatu are a few names on that short list. Early in Avatar, when paraplegic Jake first links with his Na'vi avatar and races across the Pandoran landscape, exhilarated to be running again, I leaned forward in my seat and smiled. Once again, I wasn't watching a movie. I was watching a Dream.Avatar uses the classical narrative structure of a man who must step beyond his culture, become one with a society alien to his own, and ultimately make a stand with his new brothers. And unlike previous telling of this tale, Jake can literally step outside of his human skin and take on the form of a blue-skinned and golden-eyed humanoids called the ""Na'vi."" Neytiri, a female Na'vi, guides Jake in the ways of her tribe, and as they make this journey together a bond forms between them. ""I see you,"" she whispers to Jake. ""I see you,"" he whispers back the way two lovers might exchange ""I love you""s. And there couldn't be a more appropriate expression of affection for these characters. ""I see you."" Director James Cameron wants to open his audience's eyes, as Neytiri opens Jake's eyes, to the breathtaking sights of Pandora. But unlike visual effects masturbations like G.I. Joe and Revenge of the Fallen both of which throw CGI out randomly in an effort to create the most/biggest/boomest explosion, Avatar aims to recapture the child-like wonder of experiencing a *vision* that, to quote Manohla Dargis, ""really is bigger than life."" Another director would be content to show the majestic floating ""Hallelujah"" mountains in the distant background, but not James Cameron. He goes further and invites us to climb them with Jake and the young Na'vi hunters. After dangling perilously from vines and rock faces and clawing our way to the top, Cameron then lets us ride on the back of winged dragon-like creatures, the Mountain Banshees, and soar above and between this magical landscape of towering miracles and impossible valleys.But more importantly: amidst the overabundant spectacle, Cameron never loses sight of that child-like curiosity driving all fantasy. Do you remember staring at the cover art of your favorite book asking, ""What would it be like to fly? How exhilarating would it be holding on to a Banshee for dear life while it dove 300 feet straight down? To feel the roaring wind rush past with the intensity of a hurricane as you fly—really, truly, honestly fly?"" James Cameron remembers asking those questions.He's filled the world—the vision—of Avatar with sights both grand and subtle. This is a movie that will go full throttle into an epic battle where a legion of Banshee-mounted Na'vi fly fearlessly through the airborne mountainscape while the military gunships unleash a hellstorm of missiles, and yet it also has the patience to let Neytiri reverently pause to observe where the drifting Seeds of Eywa fall. It will show you giant colorful dinosaur-like creatures smashing through trees in the all but obligatory stampede sequence, but look closely when the Na'vi get ready to ride a Banshee and you'll see gill-like orifices through which the creatures breathe. The world of Avatar feels bigger than life, yet I felt like I could reach out, grab a sample, and take it with me.Is Avatar perfect? Far from it. It blatantly contradicts itself during the climax and brushes a little too close with propaganda in places. But like a dream, it didn't matter. When you've looked across the Pandoran landscape at night and absorbed the mystical beauty of the self-illuminating flora, when you've felt the thrill of watching Jake command the meanest predator on the planet and unite the Na'vi tribes, when you've *seen* Avatar  you don't care about its logistical faults.It's a movie about sights, and James Cameron isn't shy about that point. It's the heart of the film. It's in every frame—in the very fabric of the film. Hell, it's even spelled out in the dialogue.""I see you."" In the cold mechanical adult world of unforgiving cause and effect, Avatar is the movie to reawaken the forgotten child of so long ago. The child who believes in searching for undiscovered frontiers to explore, who believes dragons and magic exists, and who believes dreams are real. It's always refreshing finding out our inner child is still alive, that the jaded real world hasn't killed him off entirely yet.Thank you, James Cameron.",neutral
454,"I enjoyed this movie, and I think it does get a bit too much hate, I don't think it's quite as forgettable as many people claim. This is one of the most visually stunning blockbusters I've ever seen. The backgrounds look fantastic, the world is believable and well designed. The character CGI doesn't hold up as well for me, but it works. Some of the characters were likeable, but the dialogue wasn't memorable, and I have easily forgotten the characters. 67/100.",positive
455,"First of all, no review can explain what you will experience with Avatar. If you haven't seen it, go and buy your ticket... now! I cannot imagine this movie being experienced on anything other than the big screen and of course in 3-D!! Don't miss this chance because DVD/BR won't do this justice.I've heard people complain that this story has been done before, that it wouldn't be any big deal without the graphics, and plenty of other absurd statements. Obviously these come from people who want to spark arguments or from those who didn't want to like the movie in the first place. And please realize that I've read these statements on the Message Boards, not from actual Reviews. Of course the graphics and special effects make the movie what it is, but the creativity, imagination, and brilliance that went into this masterpiece are not all in the form of shooting arrows, or intense chase scenes.James Cameron's masterpiece is like nothing I've ever witnessed in my life. He's created a whole new planet and a whole new species. The Na'vi have a world complete with their own language, culture, beliefs, and other life forms inhabiting their home. For almost any aspects of human life, Cameron has given the natives an equivalent. By doing this, he allows you to really care for the characters, and share their emotions/concerns. (This also helps him to deliver a not so subtle message).OK, so there are quite a few Hollywood ""cliches""- the love story of two opposing cultures is obviously apparent. But is it possible to create a movie that is entirely original? ... I personally don't think so. At least not a movie that will appeal to various audiences.I believe that this movie sets a new standard for what should happen with the movie industry. A film of this quality doesn't come around often. In fact this film is the FIRST of it's kind, and I don't see anything coming close to it for a very, very, very long time! Even if you watch and don't find Avatar to be your kind of film, you can't deny the thought, talent, and creativity put together to make this movie. And of course, the mind-blowing visuals!! Go to the theaters and pay the full $13 ticket price for Avatar in 3-D, (or I-MAX if you can get to one) because $13 is an extremely small price to pay for witnessing this milestone in cinema history.",positive
456,"Right then lets just preface this by saying that i am a big fan of Camerons genre work to date, Terminator, Aliens etc but Avatar in NO way stands before those movies as an equal.Yes the visuals are technically flawless, and i appreciate that this film was made at all, in a increasingly re-make happy Hollywood it's encouraging that avatar pulled in the crowds, BUT (and it's a big but) there is nothing in the story that hasn't been done and said before, where is the ORIGINALITY ? (spoilers) soldier starts fighting for the wrong side, attempts to infiltrate the locals, goes native and swaps sides, leads the locals in epic fight back and gets the girl, it's all been done so many times before (Man Called Horse, Last Samurai, Silent Running, Dances With Wolves and a dozen others i could mention) we know Cameron has the nounce and weight to pretty much make what he wants so why stick to such a weary formula?.I haven't read all 3000 plus reviews for this movie (God Forbid) but flicking through the titles i was struck by how many people raved about what a revolutionary movie it is, how it will change the way movies are made and how ""Real"" Pandora was, just to straighten things out a bit the answers are NO it isn't, NO it wont and NO it wasn't respectively. Of course this film has taken a zillion dollars already so i am obviously in the minority, however here are a few specific points that i will take issue with1. Where is the character development? 2. Where is the damn backstory?, WHY is earth dying?, what does unobtanium DO? HOW was Pandora discovered? 3. That ""Epic"" final battle.....waaay too short 4. That pesky cockpit glass sure changes density fast! 5. That whole ""Living world"" thing, just didn't cut it for me, it was like watching an animated Roger Dean album cover.But the one thing that kept me from immersing myself was the fact that a big part of me was screaming IT'S A CARTOON, a well made cartoon certainly but at no time did i feel that any of it was ""Real"", this is now i believe the most successful film of all time and all power to Cameron, but c'mon Jim for the next project let's have something that's REALLY out there......please",neutral
457,"Avatar is an excellent movie by any standard, but in 3-D it truly stands as the new gold standard in fantasy and/or sci-fi entertainment. Multiple elements make this a great movie: good story line with moral depth, interesting characters that we can care about (and the real brilliance here, of course, is that the avatar characters are as interesting, if not more so, than the ""real life"" characters), fabulous rich cinematography, seamless CG and special effects, and of course venturing into a brilliantly colored, multi-dimensional and mesmerizing world we've never seen before. In a packed theater, the end of this film came with enthusiastic applause from almost everyone in attendance -- interestingly, the last time I experienced a really identical experience was Titanic. Go figure! What more can be asked of a movie? Only the future will answer this question.",positive
458,"James Cameron's highly anticipated epic, Avatar, raises the question: Are special effects enough to launch a new era in filmmaking? In terms of storyline, the plot offers nothing new: once again, greedy Americans are exploiting new lands for valuable resources, and disturbing the natives. The protagonist, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), works for a big corporation but soon finds himself befriending the natives, falling in love, and growing distant from his people because he identifies with the natives' way of life more than his own.Sound familiar? That's because this story has been recycled time and time again. We see it in our history in the settlers' treatment of Native Americans, and it is the plot of the 1990 film Dances with Wolves. Cameron has acknowledged Avatar's similarities to Dances with Wolves, which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Taking into account that Cameron's own Titanic won 11 Academy Awards, you can see where this is heading.In Cameron's rendition, the natives are a species of alien called the Na'vi. Essentially, the aliens are a gimmick; aside from their sparkly blue skin, extreme height, and tails they are completely uninspired reincarnations of Native Americans. The Na'vi even dress like ­Native Americans, use bows and arrows, live in close-knit family tribes, are spiritually connected to nature, and are threatened by the imperialistic, capitalistic white men because they stand in the way of precious resources. With this story set in the future in outer space, Cameron had the opportunity to formulate truly new and creative creatures but instead opted for imitation and unoriginality.Avatar deviates from its predecessors, though, in its simplicity, character development (or lack thereof), and tone. The distinction between good and bad is riddled with clichés and one-dimensional characters that make for a predictable outcome. While the film could have emphasized Jake's moral dilemma, he actually has no trouble deciding his loyalties, showing how Avatar sacrifices reality and the truth about human nature for the formulaic ingredients of a feel-good audience pleaser. At the same time, Cameron spoonfeeds the audience environmental awareness and lessons on the dangers of war, making Avatar preachy and, at times, tedious.Of course, the film is not without its merits. Cameron himself modestly told The New Yorker that his special effects work is ""the most complicated stuff anyone's ever done."" And he has succeeded in creating a new world of sparkling colors, fantastic creatures, and breathtaking landscapes.Does a film this unoriginal deserve the accolades it is receiving from audiences and critics alike? Is it really a breakthrough in filmmaking? Filmmaking is an art with many aspects, special effects being just one. We will see come Oscar time what the Academy thinks, and only time will tell whether Avatar becomes a true classic.",negative
459,"So, I'm not a reviewer but just got back from seeing the Movie and whilst I didn't go WoW! I must comment on the completeness of the film.what feeling I had walking away was Humanity... and it took an alien nation to show it.The 3d effect was good without making you feel ill, and the alien landscape was amazing. The acting was excellent and the dialogue was very natural, OK there was a few cliché's but hey it just reinforces the characteroverall though I was fully immersed in the film and didn't feel that there was any weaknesses. and would look forward to a sequel",positive
460,"I would like to ask a question: is there someone in the audience who witnessed the first coming of 3D in the sixties? I would really like to read some reactions from adults back then. (Not just for the sake of comparisons, technological or others. I am not even sure if it is cultural the same way, cultural differences aside.)It surely is sweeping. It is mind-numbing in a way, or more ways if you will. Yet the audience reacted in a strange way, I mean the audience from Athens, Greece, where I saw the film, 3D and all, and this is what I would like to share, since everybody will make his own experience on watching the film, and then will react to the reviews. So, this is it: let's say that the film risks to get short-circuited into an allegory of a choice between the ""real"" and a virtual reality, with the hero switching between ""bodies"", like in a game, as some detractors would probably say. My question was: when the point comes, for it was galloping towards us in the climax, will the hero choose his invalid body and thus validate his existence as a hero, or regress to the virtual realm and as such deliver us to the deadlock of a fantasy world? Although this remains unresolved in a way at the end, even titillating us with the promise of a sequel, and here I go back to the bizarre reaction from the audience, are we sure we want to go to the end of our fantasy world? It surely is entertaining, but is it all the way?When Neytiri saves Jake Sully from suffocation, and they, then, just before the end, meet for the first time ""as they really are"", the audience burst out laughing, as if this was gruesome and incongruous for the sake of the love story. As if everything else in the story could be awesome, or agenda-ridden, but not what happens between a male and a female, even though, well, they are of a different species. It reminded me of a TV ad that appeared some years now - girl wanders in the woods, encounters a frog, kisses frog, frog becomes prince, prince looks somewhat dubiously girl, kisses girl, girl becomes beer, he drinks beer. You guessed it, the ad was for a beer. So, the question I would like to pose is: what does a beer taste like on Pandora, is the gist of the film?Please tell me.Open my eyes.",positive
461,"Let's begin with the story. Many people I have heard are complaining about how the story lacks depth, how it is unoriginal, and even copies the ideas of other movies that were made after the story of Avatar was created 12 years ago. To say that a movie does not have an original plot is an easy argument in the film business today, if you take how many movies we have now I'm sure you could find one that fits with every other one. This is beyond the point. The story of Avatar was to show a crisp example of the greed driven brutality of the human race, which is becoming a more popular topic in video today. Often in films today you see a lot of gore, sexual humor, sex, or drug use to depict a writer's point. None of this can be found in Avatar. This movie took a plot concept that so many other movies have been attempting to use, stripped it of all popular techniques of the culture today, and made it into a beautiful film.So, what made the movie as good as it was? The VISUALS. Certain scenes in this movie that show the nature of Pandora will literally bring you to tears. I am finding it hard to understand why this factor is being overlooked in reviews when in reality it is the driving force as to why this movie is so amazing. The point of a film is to put the viewer in a situation that is otherwise hard to imagine, correct? Every single person upon leaving the theater, including the people I went with were dreaming of living as an Avatar in the world of Pandora, as the main character was in the movie as well. This movie took every detail of the terrain, and lit it up with fireworks, creating the most spectacular case of eye candy you will ever experience.After watching this movie, you will not have goosebumps and your blood will not be racing because of copious amounts of action as it would be in Transformers or such. Your jaw will be dropped and your imagination will be on a roller coaster ride through your own vision of Pandora.My final advice to you, pay the extra 5$ and see this movie in Imax 3D, trust me.",positive
462,"This is the M.O.A.B. - The mother of all Blockbusters.Finally, a movie that lives up to all the hype and expense, and then surpasses all my wildest expectations. Hats off to James Cameron for creating this marvelous spectacle that is the Epic of Avatar.This movie is so incredibly well executed from beginning to end. I consider it the perfect film. The story is an old tried and true plot, but with a fantastic sci-fi plot. The effects are phenomenal, and at times visually stunning...beyond words.Folks, this is a film an a massive scope...Epic to the extreme...not to be missed. Do not wait for it to come to hove video. This one needs to be experience on the big screen and in stunning 3D. James Cameron has now joined the ranks of the big Director-Gods, such as Lucas and Jackson. This one is one for the history books as the greatest sci-fi epic of them all!",positive
463,"the visuals are great even superb, however like titanic it is fatally flawed and like titanic in 1 years time people will vote this either best film of all time or worst film of all time. it is neither . the hype however is not matched by the film, a good cartoon is still only a cartoon. if anything this shows up the major problems with this kind of film. however much you try to make a cgi character look and act like a real actor it can't be done, try going to see a real live play twice and see how the actors vary and improve performances. Here we have the nearest a cartoon can get to a real film, that is Cameron's triumph, but a hackneyed script and weak dialogue make it seem like a bad episode of star trek or lost in space. This may be the way forwards for film but not yet!",neutral

Not enough energy was spent on telling a story or character development...The story stays through in that the good guys win over the bad and that history repeats itself ....I am not sure why the lead scientist, a strong female, concerned about the natives, has to SMOKE...Maybe a good sum (for product placement:tobacco industry)was giving to the director to help pay for the film....even though he is said to be rich...Often films do well because there is not much else going on....and the media focuses on it....They do not give equal time to all that comes out and only (mostly)american films...",neutral
465,"avatar is a revolution in 3d cinema as well as 2d,almost the entire movie has been made using computer graphics,and to say the least,they are stunning if not mind blowing.the environment created by the design team is very well thought of and a lot of attention has been given into intricate details.as far as the story goes,it is a little predictable but does not effect the thrill watching the movie by any means.the action sequences are electrifying and the viewer gets a feeling of actually being inside the movie.Acting has been top notch,from the human actors that is.the animated characters have been made in such a way that they look more real then their human counterparts.other than the impressive graphics and story,the moral of the movie is also a very good and makes the viewers think.the one thing i can guarantee about avatar is that you wont leave the cinema halls disappointed.in fact you will want to pay it another visit.watching this film in 3d is a must for anyone who enjoys watching movies.for those who don't,it is still worth the ticket money.",positive
466,"I, like everyone else, went straight away to see this movie on the big screen. I saw it within the week of it coming out. It was a spectacular film from a visuals point of view. But taking into account the storyline and acting, the movie was weak. The story was clichéd, like everyone else on here has pointed out. Also, the acting was very wooden. The only aspect which saved the movie from being a total failure was the A class special effects and CGI work from Weta workshop in Wellington, New Zealand.I hope that Avatar 2 will be an improvement on the trollope that was served up.",neutral
467,"I've seen some of James Cameron's movies. Titanic is powerful, AND SO IS AVATAR! I can't really call it a film. It's beyond that - IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ADVENTURE! I was more than interested when I saw the trailer, and after reading the plot outline on IMDb, I HAD to see it! At first, I was interested with the opening sequence and the mining operation on Pandora in the year 2154. The Na'vi had my eyes fixed on them throughout the entire adventure! I want to join them and I offer my love to them! In fact, blue is my favourite colour! Everyone involved with making this masterpiece did exceptionally brilliantly! I walked out of the cinema filled with excitement! When Jake explains how, when you're dreaming, sooner or later you have to wake up, I was thinking the same. I agree with this, but not if the dream isn't a dream, but reality. If I had to choose between following orders and protecting the Na'vi, I would choose to protect the Na'vi. I shared Jake's experience of not wanting to go back to Earth after seeing how amazing Pandora was, hearing words like, ""You have a strong heart,"" and ""One life ends, another begins,"" becoming one of the people – and falling in love. I have a strong and loving heart, and I learn things quickly. Love is a powerful sweetener to an incredible adventure.I enjoyed the scenes where Neytiri shows Jake how to fly the Ikran. I would say, ""Yah!"" with excitement before taking flight. My FAVOURITE scene is when Jake is initiated into the Omaticaya, and he and Neytiri choose each other. I LOVE the dialogue in that scene, and the romance is amazing! I would choose Peyral because she is a good hunter. (Who am I to choose someone who has already chosen?) I'm a good dancer and would use my moves and skills whilst learning to become one of the people. I also enjoyed the battle scenes, and I could feel the emotional outcome when Hometree was destroyed, (I was saddened by that) but to be honest, there were times during the adventure when I thought it would end, but I'm glad it didn't. (I know that James Cameron has confirmed the possibility of two sequels.) I LOVE the scenes where Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other clans to repel the humans. The final battle is very entertaining and the effects are incredible! I enjoyed every moment of it and felt as if I was in it and fighting alongside the Na'vi. I also felt a wave of relief and some pleasure when Neytiri killed Quaritch and saved Jake. I feel this way when good triumphs over evil. I remembered Titanic and was hoping that Jake would survive - and I was SO pleased when Neytiri saved him. That's another scene I TOTALLY LOVE - with the attack repelled, Neytiri and Jake reaffirm their love as she sees Jake in his human body for the first time. It's so beautiful! Love's complicated!As I watched the remaining corporate personnel being expelled from Pandora, while, Jake, Norm and other scientists were allowed to remain, it reminded me of a play I performed in in 2006. I'm VERY happy at the end when the clan performs the ritual that permanently transfers Jake from his human body into his Na'vi avatar. At some points in the adventure, I was actually hoping that would happen. I'm VERY pleased that it did! The ending's not bad at all, but I reckon that after Jake was transferred into his Na'vi avatar, Jake stood up, Neytiri smiled at him and they kissed. The people would then cheer!The experience is incredible and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for any sense of adventure! The words, ""I see you"" are powerful and effective and if I were transferred into a Na'vi avatar. (I would LOVE to actually!) those would be the first words I would say. The song ""I See You"" is also powerful and very effective. Thinking about it now, if I were with Jake at the end of the film, as a Na'vi avatar, I would say some of the many words the song involves. Speaking of the music, I noticed at times during the adventure, I heard two of the notes from Titanic's theme.I find that parts of a POWERFUL adventure stay with you after it's over, but this adventure is eternal! After the experiences I went through a few years ago, I'm NEVER going back to how I used to be. Love is my FAVOURITE emotion and it's EVEN STRONGER now that I've seen Avatar. Whenever I saw any stills or clips of Avatar, they struck my heart like love lightning - love SO strong! I have a strong heart and I believe that the power of love, more than just an emotion, but a strong feeling and/or affection, also plays a vital role in facing danger, having no fear, protecting others and standing together as one! Don't feel lost in love. Have the bravery the stand up and let it flow like a river of honey! Become one with the power of love! If your dreams become reality, and you are on Pandora, walking or flying with the Na'vi, you may see me there.Love, James.",positive

469,"Confused already? No? Well apparently millions of people weren't either,when they declared this to be one of the best movies they've seen in their lives,and then presumably bought a second and third and fourth cinema ticket to see this.I am not one of those people.I was confused.And amused.And pardon me for saying this,but I had to wake up the latent retard in me to be able to enjoy riding flying dragons,some unidentified horse-like hippo,a Jurassic something and a whole world apparently perfect. Well,that bothers me.Nothing is perfect.Even when you're high,you know that you're going to have a hang-over.Those Navi's were so perfect that it made me suspicious.The movie doesn't show this,but i bet they were into something really nasty,like attacking other tribes and raping all the women.And I bet they had their way with those flying dragons.Yes,I'm talking zoophilia with a dragon.Nevermind connecting neuron pony tales,how about connecting some penis and dragon pussy.Disgusted already? Now you know how I felt when watching Avatar.Oh yes,the CGI was ground-breaking.Let's hope next time Cameron just employs hundreds of Indian and Chinese computer programmers to give us Avatar 2, no actors,no common sense,no plot,just a diluted message and just computer generated Navis being perfect in their perfect world.",negative
470,This is a MUST SEE movie in 3D and preferably in IMAX. James Cameron was very wise to wait for computer animation to catch up to his vision because OMG it's spectacular!There are more than a dozen animation studios world-wide who all contributed to a realism of graphics that has never before been so natural. Amazing considering that most of the movie is based on a new planet with all animals and most plants having totally new characteristics.The visuals and sounds/music is immersive & realistic. The story will leave you satisfied. All mature audiences will love it.This is NOT a typical multi-part comic book movie that always leaves you hanging.Go see it on the big screen and enjoy the BEST movie of all time!!,positive
471,"Why I say that? Let's see: First the story was simple. No big twists, no million story-lines, no needless happenings. No too much love and no incompetent characters. No cool heroes, no bitch-like girls for show. And no airy, flippant characters for bringing boring jokes and making the movie awkward.Second the CGI is masterful and it is through the entire movie not just for some big scenes. From the first leaf to the last water drop, all exist. When a plane crashing to the trees, when the birds flying over the water, it really happens, you don't feel it's just CGI. Amazing.The clichés? Well, there are elements in the movie we already saw in other movies, but who cares? We already saw Titanic before Cameron's version, and we saw movies about prisoners before Shawshank Redemption. If somebody shots a good photo of a sunset, nobody should shot sunsets ever more? I don't care about clichés when they are in perfect balance with the other components of the movie.Overall, this movie is well balanced with good characters, a unique CGI and unique way it brings the well known message about protecting your environment. (10 is for perfect not just excellent.)",positive

473,"Its basically the visuals. I could see why this film took 12 years to make. The plot is relatively simple. Its like the good conquistador and the natives just before the rest of the Spanish arrive and rape, pillage, plunder, except the natives are blue not brown and the Spanish are Earthlings. The visual effects are crazy son! Its an entirely lifelike world created in a desktop. There's a detailed explanation to every fictitious wildlife. However watching this you realize that the imagination is only limited to whatever we see. Everything in the film comes from something we have seen before. Native tribes, tigers, rhinos, lemurs, horses, wolves and giant birds. 12 years of work went into it so the hype didn't fail. One thing. This movie is called Avatar, a word from Hindu mythology, did it have anything to do with it? Possibly, because there were BLUE PEOPLE in the movie!",positive
474,"Went to see the movie last Saturday at the local I.M.A.X. This is the first chance I have had to write the review, even though the movie and its impact on me has been in the back of my mind since the experience.Experience is the word, this movie is epic, beautiful, engaging, exhilarating and quite simply fantastical.The slight extra cost to view the film (IMAX 3D) was worth every penny and a load more.Visuals are simply stunning from the off. The 3D is extremely impressive from the start and instantly you are emerged in the movie/experience.Yes the story is the same story we have read/seen many times, however the way its presented and told is very well done. Good pacing, great direction and an brilliant score help the 3hrs pass in a flash.So is the movie the groundbreaking event its hyped to be? Well you will have NEVER seen anything quite like this before, so in that respect it is. The effects are almost perfect excluding a couple of frames here and there.James Cameron just knows how to entertain, arguably better than any modern day director/movie maker? Avatar is yet another strong tick in his resume. Personally this could be my favourite Cameron movie in fact.There is nothing I didn't like or enjoy about Avatar. All the cast were fantastic, even though some where only CGI character they still did a great job. Nobody in the production of this movie let the side down.10/10 An epic of the modern day. Quite simply puts a lot of ""event movies"" to shame. Watch this then watch Transformers 2. Night and day.The King of the World is BACK.",neutral

This is entertainment friends, exciting, action packed, engaging, romantic, funny, its report card is all As, it passed every class.

Add to that the jaw dislocating effects and top it off with great actors doing their best work and Jimbo's done it again.Is this worth my Pounds, Dollars, whatever ? wholeheartedly YES, even if your not normally a sci-fi kind of soul, its much more than that, see it 3D, see it Imax, just see it, it really is that good.",positive
477,"Above average fantasy & SF movie. Could be superb if it didn't push it's message too hard. I don't mind a movie with a message. But at times, Cameron pushes the message too hard and it feels like Greenpeace forced him to do it with a gun pointed at his head. It reminds me of the forced learning of the catechesis, that one didn't make much of a difference too.",positive
478,"Avatar is a HUUUUGE wow... stunning, spectacular and the cinematic experience of the new generation. It's once in a life time experience and a film which would change the way movies are made forever. Kudos to the master James Cameron for bringing us this visually stunning treat. It is a film meant to be seen in 3D and multiple times. One time viewing is not enough to absorb all the details and visuals shown. The visual effects are eye-popping and jaw-dropping. Though story could have been a little better. Given that Cameron is master of sequel (T2) I would be anxiously waiting for a sequel. Also given the magnificent place Pandora is, it needs another film to be discovered fully.",positive
479,"Especially once I had seen it, for myself, I was able to understand that the allegation of racism is completely ridiculous, as I understand this allegation/criticism made against this film. I do think that some of the characters in the film, specifically the Colonel, definitively, & Parker, probably, are at least bigoted in a way that borrows rather heavily from the racism inflicted upon the 500 Nations people of the Americas; but, that doesn't really make the characters racist, such as & specifically, in the way that those who inflicted the racism, of Manifest Destiny, etc., were onto the people of the 500 Nations. Yes, there's a similarity there; but, it's not the same thing. Although, a definitive argument against this is when the Colonel asks...""Hey, Sully, how's it feels to betray your own race?"" On the whole, the bigotry is about speciesism...not racism. So, maybe the Colonel is a racist apart from what it is actually about for the movie as a whole.Another important difference is that this film uses a corporatist justification for the bigotry, theft and murder of & from the Na'vi. The bigotry, which was undeniably racism, inflicted upon the 500 Nations people was predominantly Manifest Destiny, which was a religious - Christian fundamentalist - justification for the rape, murder & theft of & from the 500 Nations people. Yea, maybe it is splitting hairs to say that this one is racist & that one isn't, when the differences, religion, species not race, are relatively meaningless when you really look at it. But, even if the bad guys are racist in this film, at least it's the bad guys that are racist & not the good guys and not the film as a whole.Probably the biggest flaw about this film is that there is no attempt on the part of the characters to make a thoughtful examination and comparison with & between what is being done to the Na'vi, in this story, & what was done to the 500 Nations people, in reality, & if that also had been a part of this story. If that conversation had taken place within the dialogue & between the characters during this film I think that while the film may still have received some criticism, specifically from bigots, it would have received praise, overall, for tackling the subject.",positive
480,"My fianc√© and I bought this while on vacation for something to watch in our hotel room, figuring after all the rave reviews that it would be a solid choice. By the end, the two of us were slack-jawed - not by the effects, which, granted, were very visually attractive, but by how a movie so formulaic, so full of ridiculous clich√©d one-dimensional characters and simplistic dialogue, could be the talk of the world. James Cameron has an amazing eye for aesthetics, but he seriously need to find someone with a gift for writing scripts, specifically engaging dialogue. Everything about the plot, from Sigourney Weaver essentially reprising a watered down version of her role in Gorillas in the Mist to an evil army commander who reminded me of a sad caricature of every 'ignorant, war hungry army guy' ever made, the characters just... don't matter. It's saddening that this movie is sliding by on its visuals to such a high rating. If you want to watch the exact same story, only with more moving dialogue and far less bloat, rent Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest. Cameron pretty much ripped off the entire plot from it, anyway. I dread the sequels...",negative
481,"I will not lie, i did not entirely agree with the messages that they put into this film on many many levels but because of everything else that went on in this movie i find absolutely no reason whatsoever to hold that against it. I watched this movie not more than ten minutes ago and found that it was the most entertaining, gut wrenching piece of art that i have ever witnessed. There were scenes that made me feel pains of sympathy inside my stomach along with the characters of the movie as well as times were i wanted kill out of hatred. The dialog could have used some work as well as the story line but it doesn't matter whatsoever. I will go to see this movie many times over and you should to, it is big it is bold and it will knock your socks off making you completely forget any price that you paid to go see it!",positive
482,"One of the best films ever made. Avatar is full of emotion, interesting story lines, great scripts, and beautiful, incredible landscapes, creatures, and everything else. Cameron worked extremely well at bringing Pandora and the Na'vi to life. The expressions on their faces are the most real I have ever seen in animation. It's like watching actors! It's also nice to see a film with smaller actors...it gets repetitive seeing people like Brad Pitt fill 5 different roles...Sam Worthington is a great role for Jake Sully. Jake is hilarious and ignorant at first, but soon becomes a very big role model for the Na'vi. The films effects are incredible and the storyline, even though it has been done before, has a new ""fresh"" feel of it. This is the way movies should be made!",positive
483,"This movie was full of amazing effect, acting, etc etc as everyone has been saying. However there are 2 things about this movie that completely blew my mind. Firstly, the amount of creativity in the world they put on the screen. WOW! How do you come up with the plug in tails, the tree with the ancestors' voices, the animals, all of it! And its extremely amazing how realistic it all looks as well.One thing that I hope I'm not the only one seeing is the connection between this movie and the Native American hardships from the past. The culture of the Navi resembled something like the Native Americans who worshiped various aspects of nature and believed they all were connected. And the whole destruction and mourning seemed a lot like the Trail of Tears we learned about in high school.Anyway, I'll stick to the topic and say that this is really an extraordinary movie which truly deserves all of the praise and profit its getting. Here's to the return of sci fi!",positive
484,"It's been 12 years, and the VFX of Avatar still stands strong as a pioneer in the industry at its time. I enjoyed the plotline, even as it started to drag on a little. I really appreciate and admire Cameron's efforts to bring the alien world of Pandora to life, and the planet feels very real and vivid. I'm disappointed it's taken so long for a sequel to come out.",positive
485,"I liked JC's return to the big screen here - it is pretty epic but I really hope they keep the world to just this one movie as it's pretty much told everything we need to know. I wasn't too excited about seeing a 60% SFX / 40% live action split but I was pleasantly surprised by this product (saw the 3D version). Some of the plot lines a seasoned veteran can spot coming a mile away but that doesn't detract from the above-average acting and stunning computer visuals. I think the greatest challenge to any SciFi ""thinker"" like Cameron has always been in creating an ""alien"" world that is wholly unique, not just another movie filmed in Hawaii or the Sahara - I think JC accomplishes that here with all his little details in the terrain and the alien environment. His alien natives are well developed though obviously borrowing a TON from man's world history. You can easily relate the situation in this movie (the Big Bully versus David) to much of what's already been made of humankind - America forcibly taking lands and driving out the Native Americans, the British/German/Belgium/France/Spain/Portugal/Italy rape of Africa - sad to note but we're no better to one another let alone to this peaceful alien race. That aside, Avatar plays it well - perhaps a bit too ""eco-crazy"" for those Republicans out there - but a great action movie at its core nonetheless. The 3D version didn't add much to my overall experience BTW - it really just adds a little visual depth with the camera target staying in focus while the entire scene is ""layered"" in front and behind the target. So you'll see passing leaves and embers moving about in front of you - nothing too distracting/overtly cool there.",neutral

489,"Avatar, the groundbreaking film by James Cameron, presents audiences with a visually stunning world that pushes the boundaries of modern filmmaking. It undoubtedly offers a unique and immersive cinematic experience, but beneath the awe-inspiring visuals, the plot feels forced and lacks smooth transitions between scenes, relying heavily on familiar and stereotypical tropes.First and foremost, the film's visual effects are nothing short of exceptional. The lush and vibrant world of Pandora, brought to life with remarkable attention to detail, is a true visual marvel. The imaginative flora and fauna, combined with breathtaking action sequences, transport viewers to a mesmerizing alien landscape. Cameron's use of cutting-edge technology and 3D cinematography enhances the immersive experience, making Avatar a groundbreaking technical achievement.However, where Avatar falls short is in its plot execution. While the film presents an intriguing premise of humans versus the indigenous Na'vi people and explores themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes, the narrative feels formulaic and predictable. The characters, particularly the human protagonists, often fit into stereotypical roles and lack depth, making it difficult to form a strong emotional connection with them.Moreover, the transitions between scenes can feel abrupt and disjointed, resulting in a disjointed narrative flow. The pacing suffers as a result, as the film tries to balance the spectacle of action sequences with the need for character development and world-building. It occasionally feels as though certain scenes were included solely for the sake of showcasing the visual effects, rather than serving a clear narrative purpose.Despite these flaws, Avatar's strengths lie in its technical achievements and immersive world-building. The film's environmental message resonates with viewers, highlighting the importance of preserving our natural resources and respecting indigenous cultures. The attention to detail in creating the Na'vi culture and language is commendable, providing a level of depth to the world of Pandora.In summary, Avatar's stunning visual effects and immersive world-building make it a must-see film for its technical achievements alone. However, the forced plot and lack of smooth transitions between scenes detract from its overall impact. While the film manages to deliver an entertaining adventure, it relies on stereotypical character tropes and fails to reach its full potential as a truly groundbreaking narrative. Nevertheless, Avatar remains a visually impressive spectacle that left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.",neutral
490,"The real theme of Avatar is the megalomania of the director. He thinks he can create a world from scratch, and he thinks of this world as Paradise. The only problem is that beauty comes from within. Bloated with megalomania as he is, his vision of Paradise comes across as Hell instead. I found the viewing of Pandora excruciating. There was a persistent sense of nausea throughout. It was meant to be the essence of beauty. But blue men with long tails undulating behind them are a utter perversity to the eyes. The garish plant life reeked of poison. The animals combined insect, reptile and mammal, bringing out the worst features in each. How anyone can conceive of this concoction as beautiful is beyond me. Compared to this the slimy aliens in Cameron's earlier films are tame.In truth, I am suspicious of anyone who calls Pandora beautiful. My theory is this: There is something ugly inside that is compels them to say that Pandora is beautiful. They take into consideration the budget of the film, the fact that it's made by the ""king of the world"", that it stands as a testament to human ingenuity (technology, CGI and so on), that the film becomes the byword for hype, that it promotes the cult of celebrity, etc. In other words, those who find Pandora beautiful are also those who idolize the megalomania of Cameron. It's all a matter of worshipping excess, and if you do, you find Pandora beautiful. Otherwise you say, Hey, why are those slimy tentacles sticking out of all those animals on that planet? Yuck! The rest is a thinly disguised critique of the American invasion of Iraq, or more generally the military industrial complex. But of course it is hypocrisy through and through. Hollywood excess is an integral part of the military industrial complex, and Cameron is at the vanguard of Hollywood excess. He's a hypocrite, and no wonder his vision comes across as so ugly. Of course, not many people will say so. Not if they are worshipping at the altar of pride and excess. So Cameron taps into the general malaise and makes a lot of money. That's all there is to Avatar. It's a testament to greed and megalomania. In this universe of excess there is a ""paradise"", which the film tries to recreate. If you live in that universe you will find the vision beautiful. If you don't, it is the very definition of repulsive.",negative
491,"""Avatar"" by James Cameron is arguably a perfect film judging by its methodological approach, and from a technical standpoint it still stands unrivaled as a feat of the vision of a director. Add to that charming characters as well as a touching theme, and a great film is in the mold.The film is a mere spectacle to look at with well-deserved visual effects winning the team an academy award. Cameron did a fantastic job at writing, directing, and editing this film into a smooth script with excellent punchlines. The production design is overwhelming is still to this day practically unparralelled with incredible attention to detail from the sky to little bugs flying around in the evening air. The score by James Horner is nothing short of magnificent and fitting very well with the grand visual scheme of the film.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and others deliver excellent performances, all of which are portrayed in very natural ways in spite of the sci-fi avatar-driven production.Avatar has received a lot of hate for its seemingly adapted screenplay from Pocahontas. Rather than focusing on the plot this is a film which really utilizes the narrative in new, constructive and creative ways. As a statement in cinema history, I believe ""Avatar"" is a brilliant example of a director's vision for a film which at the time of its inception molded the state of the art.Highly recommended.",positive
492,"I was originally a little harsh in my first review of ""Avatar,"" believing that the film was too reliant on its visuals and CGI to make up for its one-dimensional story. However, after having watched it a second time, I noticed that the flaws didn't seem as big as when I first watched it, while the film's pluses shone even more.As many reviewers have previously mentioned, the quality of the visuals are not up for debate. Pandora is wonderfully realized; you can see that James Cameron was obviously inspired by the Amazon rainforest for his fantastical, near-dreamlike visions. The floating mountains, as well as the floating waterfall, seem to be like Angel Falls broken up and thrown into the sky (I don't think it's coincidence that Cameron had Jake Sully serve in Venezuela once). And as for the Na'vi, there were a few moments when they seemed photo-real. Cameron has had a long history of getting the CGI to look as close to realistic as possible, and just like in ""T2"" and ""Titanic,"" his attention to the graphics pays off.Another thing I noticed was that the acting was mostly solid by everyone, and that there seemed to be no weak performances (something I could not say about ""Titanic""). While there are no standouts, both lead and supporting actors and actresses seem very in tune with their characters and with each other. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana carry the film well, and their romance even felt a little touching. Sigourney Weaver isn't as strong here as she is in some of her earlier roles, but she's fine nonetheless. Stephen Lang also gets to chew the scenery up as one of the meanest soldiers this side of Colonel Kilgore.As for the plot, it's pretty similar to ""Dances With Wolves."" Only Jake Sully and (more or less) Neytiri feel developed into three-dimensional characters, while the rest of the cast either lack dimensions or only serve for important plot points. There are also a couple of hokey, heavy handed moments during important parts (kind of to be expected from Cameron's pictures). Perhaps another rewrite would have fleshed out more characters and cleaned up some of the dialogue.Still, it works. Because Jake Sully was well developed, I felt engaged in his quest to get to know the Na'vi better and, eventually, defend them. I was always impressed by ""Avatar's"" visuals and CGI. While I wouldn't call ""Avatar"" one of the best film's of 2009, I will say it is definitely one of the most entertaining, and represents another solid hit for Cameron's attention to great visuals and superb CGI.",positive
493,"Let me start by saying i went to see this movie in 3D which i would say made a huge difference. You need to go see this movie in 3D version while it's in theaters, no exceptions. The Movie has a good story line and it was action packed. Visually this movie is mind blowing and you will feel like you on a drug minus the negative effects drugs have. I am not promoting drug use or nor have I've done drugs and just using as an metaphor to describe how trippy you feel. You kind of feel you are really there in outer space and your actually in the forest with these vibrant colors. I am glad my gf assisted a pond me going. It's a good movie despite the so-so or weak movies that are currently out. I believe this film with have the same branding style that the matrix had, because before both films we never saw nothing with a signature like it before. I don't want to give anything away ...i just want to say bravo to everyone that worked on putting this together..well worth my 14 dollars",positive
494,"I went in hoping for a good flick, but instead was mesmerized for 162 minutes. After it was over, it took me a few minutes to peel myself off the theatre chair. Having seen well over 10,000 Fims in my 53 Years, i now have a new #1 movie, by the unassuming name of AVATAR. Let me preempt the nay sayers; To LOVE this film, you need to appreciate at least one or more of these Genres; (1) Epic Sci-Fi / Fantasy, (2) Action Adventure, (3) Sub-Text Morality stories, (4) Love Stories, (5) War & Technology, (6) Mind-Blowing special Effects, (7) Superb storyline. Amazingly, my wife & 2 teenager children would have none of this, and were not willing to even give it a chance, all they saw was silly BLUE people in the ads. It is their LOSS, as it is irrelevant to me if it is not their type of flick. I assume that Moviegoers that accompanied a Fantasy fan,& do not like these genres, have dragged down the rating from the rightful #1 position. If you do have an appreciation for the listed genres, this is an absolute MUST SEE in the Theatre in 3-D movie. Travel 100 Miles if necessary, you will not regret it.I have become very JADED over the last few years. Many movies & TV Series have been ""Pretty Good"", but nothing recent has Blown me away, like this new classic. The Original Star Wars on opening day was the first time i was this in AWE of a movie. Raiders of the Ark on opening night, was the next time i found myself overwhelmed by a mere movie. Only every once in a while is a film SO GOOD that it was worth living an extra 30 YEARS just to see it, & this was THAT film for me. It was so darned good that i had Shivers going up & down my Spine thru much of the movie. The 3-D was so good it almost felt like i was inside the film. I was pulled right into the Fantasy Storyline & wept for the characters. It is so far ahead of the recent competition, it might not be surpassed for decades to come. Go with another Fantasy fan, & hold on to your Socks ...",positive

I've never ever, not once in my life, felt like crying during a movie, not even when I was a kid, and no, not even for The Lion King. But Avatar got to me like no movie ever did. It was such mind-numbingly beautiful and poignant experience that I felt awed just by being in the theater.It's embarrassing and strange for me to even say this, but when I got home, Avatar had me in tears. I may write a coherent comment later, when I have the words.James Cameron, you humble us all.",neutral
496,"Avatar is known as the movie for making the newest three-dimensional screen experience, directed by James Cameron. Avatar is also known for the incredibly high box office, which tops all movies below. Avatar is from my point of view a bit overrated. I understand why people liked it, I liked it too, but I don't think it deserved so high popularity. It was good, but it could be much better. The tale of the high blue Smurfs begins, and the dangers they have to go through and defeat. The plot is basically about people who land on a planet, where they discover new species and unique animals. They have to fight them, and one of the sky-people (Humans) become friends with the blue high Smurfs and together they will fight back their territory. I mean, sort of a story like that we have got a million times. The story is nothing new, but the movie did the great job with the visuals. The visuals and effects were amazing. The locations and the magical world of Pandora were fantastically made, very colorful and looking very real, what I think is very cool. It's amazing how many plants, animals and languages they could make in this movie. Everything was explained in detail, everything was worked in detail, so the visuals made their job, and I have to give a big applause to the crew that made it. The nostalgic, dynamic music soundtrack did the job in here, too. The Avatar Theme is something that I can remember very good. The acting, let's be honest, is not on the highest shelf, but they did the job as good as they were supposed to do. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver were my personal favourites, played their roles best and with emotion, they played most real, if you know what I mean. I can see that the moral they try to put in here is that you have to protect nature and take care of the people that you love mostly. Something that you can learn from this movie is very clear in here. But if I have to be completely honest, this movie was ok, a bit overrated, but I think it is still a fun experience and something worth watching anyway. If you want to see a science fiction movie once, this can be a good one.",positive

Never before have I seen such detail in textures and animations in a film like this, it was flawless! This is hands down one of the best films ever conceived in todays technology. Just to explain abit (No Spoilers) about what it looks like, there is next to no difference at all between the cg rendered avatars and the human actors. facial expressions, the lip sync, motor skills and physics. Everything is so well blended you can not help but stare in awe at this movie. So stop reading this, get off your computer chair, grab your keys and get to the movies.

498,"Avatar is considered by some to be the greatest film of all time and I do say that I disagree. While it is the highest selling, I do not think it is the best by far. There are plenty of good things about the film. There are a few good acting performances that made the film better. Obviously the effects were incredible, breathtaking to say the least. It would be stupid to say otherwise. And for once a film wasn't mediocre in 3-D, Avatar got this accomplished well.However, I feel cons outweigh the pros for this installment. First off, the clich√©s killed me, such as ""Unobtainium"" and ""Pandora"". That was a minor annoyance compared to the plot. It was so obvious and predictable that is was hard to try to get into it. I felt I was watching a laser light show rather than a movie: beautiful, but no substance. I do think that the movie is was too overrated. Far better ones came out that year and this year. While it obviously raised the bar in effects miles ahead of where it had been, it just couldn't take you in like a magnificent movie does. I believe it is simply an average movie, not great but not too bad either.",neutral
499,"In the 12 years since his mega-epic turned into a 'Titanic' even at the box-office collections, James Cameron has been busy transforming his childhood fantasy into an epitome of Hollywood's celebrated creativity standard. Drawing inspiration from several sources including George Lucas, Wachowski Brothers and Peter Jackson, Cameron created an all new world of unprecedented sights and sounds in Pandora where the Na'vi live in spiritual harmony with all of Eywa's beings. Humans, as always, have a selfish plan that would require displacement of the native race for extraction of a precious resource 'unobtainium'. Pandora's lethal atmosphere and the need for a humane approach prompt the invading Humans to back Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver)'s scientific technique of infiltrating Pandora with Avatars created by mixed DNA of Humans and the Na'vi. Thus, a paraplegic ex- marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is chosen for this experiment and while he lays in the sealed chamber, his mentally connected Avatar lands on the stunning surface of Pandora. Jake's mission is to provide military information about Pandora to his commander while he engages with the natives to gradually become a part of them and eventually convince them to relocate. This engagement reveals to him the the sheer enchanting beauty that lies within the homeland of the Na'vi. The bioluminescent forest grounds, the eccentric creatures that ram through the woods, hounds, little apes and the Banshees that soar over the majestic floating mountains of Pandora are all exotic creatures that are vividly depicted by the trusted WETA studios. Jake befriends Neytiri, a Princess of her land who, with her big golden eyes, big pointy ears and defensive snarls in moments of aggression introduces him into her world. The following tender love story between them is only disrupted by the urgency of Jake's real mission with an unreal deadline. Human greed gets the better of Jake's selfless attempts in salvaging the lair of the tribe and so, War is declared.....James Cameron leaves no stone unturned on Pandora. His exhaustive attention to detail is simply overwhelming to the eyes that are hopefully wearing the 3-D glasses! With a plot that will by no means get him even an MTV Movie award, Cameron keeps us entertained through the 2 hour 40 minute duration of the film by making it a non-laborious tour of delight, exotica, fantasy, destruction, battle and victory. The plot could have been more convoluted to excite the nervous system or draw more sci-fi fans, the dialogues could've been more epic than generic and our world could've had a more unpredictable future but Cameron caters his Avatar to a wider audience with simplicity in those aspects while the focus of the entire cast and crew was to create the special effects, perfect the depth of field of objects for 3-D, delineate every detail demanded by Cameron's fantasies of another world and make sure it all looks awesome on IMAX. Avatar is a showcase of tomorrow's motion picture. It sets a new standard in special effects for films and with its beautiful hues and colors, makes an absolutely stunning journey into a fantastic adventure on Pandora. Do your best to catch it on IMAX 3-D..... else, just be jealous of those who did.9.19 on a scale of 1-10.",positive
500,"I expected better of Avatar. I saw advertisements of it everywhere and then when it came out, I watched it because that's what most people do. It was boring. It beat doing nothing...by a little. The logic of this movie is very confusing. The idea that we will be able to get transferred to other bodies is an excellent idea, but the way they portray makes no sense to me. They do it to be able to infiltrate and kill the blue inhabitants of a planet that is not Earth. Then of course the main character falls in love and that affects how the movie ends, because he gathers an army and kills the people. As doing so, saves the planet and stays as the blue man he was transformed into for the rest of his life. The effects were really good in this movie. That deserves a compliment. I also like what they did to the planet to make it look different from ours (especially the giant tree). All in all it was an OK movie.",neutral

It's not garbage, it IS stomachable.. but it was definitely not good or ""brilliant"". Actually sub par is a good way to describe it. It was a let down considering how much hype this movie gets.How can i hate a movie that is a tad under average? well my hatred of this movie stems from the fact that everyone think's it is a masterpiece, and the sad part is, i think half of these fanboys only like it because they're supposed to like it. I could sit here all day and list reasons why this movie is garbage, but instead i'll just leave you with a quote from my English teacher before every power point assignment: ""Visuals and extras do not make a powerpoint, content does- don't waste your time with special effects, animations, background, or transitions until your message is perfected.""",neutral

503,"A lot of words has been written so far in relation to Avatar so it makes no sense to write the same again. I fully agree with people who claims that this particular movie lacks innovative plot, subtle script an so on. But who cares?! The sole purpose of this movie was to introduce REALLY stunning visual effects and the purpose has been achieved in 200%. Leaving the cinema I felt like 30 years before when I saw Star Wars for the first time. And I don't care if others claim Avatar is shallow in terms of intrigue.I made however quite interesting observation. I have scanned through opinions of people who rated Avatar 0 of 10. More then 30% of ""worst"" opinions has been written by people who did it for the first time. Another 30-40% has been written by those who previously have written maybe 3 or 4 opinions. It was also quite interesting to see what kind of movies they referred to. I have found maybe 2 or 3 persons whose attitude was quite ""stable"". They had also write quite negative opinions for other SciFi movies - well I can understand that. They do not like this kind of art. I have found however one person who knocked me down. He has given Avatar a 0 score and at the same time rated Transformers at 7 or 8. With all due respect Transformers are in every aspect inferior to Avatar. Special effects - fine but Avatar is a class for itself. Screenplay - give me a break. Transfomers are so childish, infantile I couldn't bear some parts of it. And finally actors. Avatar is not outstanding if acting is concerned but at least there are no superheroes like MacGyver able to defeat a huge army of adversaries with a lighter or swiss knife.",positive
504,"I saw this movie today after having wanted to watch it since it came out. The movie is one step beyond in animation technology than anything else I had seen before, it is impossible to tell the difference between the real footage and the special effects. This innovative technology allows for the movie to become real, specially if watched in 3D, and brings the spectator closer to the movie, so much so that it almost feels you are actually inside the film.Apart from its astonishing visual effects this movie delivers a very well developed story from beginning to end, and although many people will say this is the typical invade the indians movie, there is clearly a lot more behind it. For starters there is a clear criticism toward the draining of natural resources of less developed nations, only for the benefit of those who have power, without the consideration for the people and the homes they destroy in the process. There are also a lot of environmental ideas behind this movie, and can be clearly observed on the relationship between the Na'vi people and their surrounding nature, also on the way they relate to other animals.Overall this movie delivers more than fantastic visual effects and story, but also takes the next step and delivers some moral values.",positive
505,"Avatar: beyond the bandwagonA Critical Analysis.I was wondering why the name Avatar first, checked Wiki and got this as an explanation, In Hinduism Avatar or Avatāra (Devanagari Sanskrit for ""descent"" viz., from heaven to earth) refers to a deliberate descent of a deity from heaven to earth, and is mostly translated into English as ""incarnation"", but more accurately as ""appearance"" or ""manifestation"". 1 In the movie however the Blue humans were considered as humans and Humans were like Gods from Above Earth. Hilarious but acceptable.Then I checked Avatar on Google on its uses. The proliferation of avatar's second meaning can be traced to Second Life, a multiplayer online virtual world, where players fashion their own online personae called avatars. Yahoo! implores instant messengers to ""Express yourself with Yahoo! Avatars"" (barely customizable icons) — a synonymy of online personae has emerged.2 Now here we have James Cameroon imagination coming to reality on celluloid as Avatar. Yes most expensive film ever made, and most talked film of the decade perhaps the century. Jim became the God. However for a movie which lacks the thrill, punch lines and above all a nice story. Anyways none of the previously released movie of Cameroon has a great story. He relied more on technology and always believed in pushing its limits. And he has done a marvelous job by doing Avatar. Avatar is not an animated movie, as assumed by many. But its graphically made like 300,Harrypotter series and many so what was new here, nothing even the hype was same like before a little more glorified. The entire world crashed for Bandwagon effect. I also read some critics saying that ""Avatar"" story is too simple, one Gujarati critic Jay Vasavda wrote that the story was kept intentionally simple so that the audience can be visually mesmerized instead of getting diverted with the complexity of the story. It means that he wants to convey the message that James Cameroon is not smart enough to handle a complex story with visuals as great. Either one has to take a back seat. Poor Jim. I consider Jurassic park and Matrix for bringing cult status by technology. Avatar is just an extension with extra hype. I don't have to visit movie theatres to see technology and no story. Jim tried to put the Navis expressions in the frame but again it was too plastic and digital that it lacked passion and yielded too many yawns. A kid will surely enjoy the movie for its action and adventure. T2 was a masterpiece and so was Titanic. Avatar is obviously better than piranha's II, Abyss, and true lies. Increasing heights, changing colors and decreasing few fingers can convert a human into navis. The funny part is that you have a tail and a plug-in like tentacle. The plug like is like a male multi threaded pin plug which you can plug into horses, UFB(Un identified flying birds). To tame anything even plants all u need is to pull and plug. The glowing jungle looks mesmerizing but is kept too dark and bluish. The philosophy of transmogrification looks so insipid that you may feel a sense of easy imagination adding some extra masala off your kitchen self. Calvin's transmorgnifier box was only better to scare Hobbes, but we are not stuffed toys. The Human chief looks very ill and too inhuman in the actions. There was a clear antithetical between good and bad, Humans were not humans and the non-Humans were like Humans. Jake was the link between these two worlds, fevicoled by a bollywoodish love story. Guy meets gal in the jungle. With his childish calm and naughtiness win over her heart then fight with the world to win over gal's society. DDLJ rings the bell. Not exactly; but a bell is a bell and it may sound akin.",neutral
506,"1 for storyline, 10 for visual effects and cinematography makes 5.5.A lot of reviewers already stated that the story is rubbish. I will not explain my view on that because i agree with all of them.Imagine to see a beautiful world, colonized by humans. Imagine conflicts between local people and the newcomers, technically superior. Imagine a fight between the sympathetic locals and the evil humans, which the locals win. Hurrah! But that's not the way it usually goes.Imagine when history books mentions that the native American-Indian people defeated the Europeans. We would all be surprised, because that's not the way events occurred. Instead of that, it was pure genocide of ""rightless"" people. It would have great if Avatar was a movie in which it demonstrated humans destroy a beautiful planet for their own benefit. Just the way it happened to current USA, Australia and more. We would all be stunned because the outstanding visual effects would have demonstrated so well how we react when we think we own someone else's place. But no, just a stupid love story and the humans flying back to their mommy's.",neutral
507,"I had a considerable amount of reservation in m y mind before going to this movie. The cause consisted in enough good movies this year already (the same District 9 etc.) and thought that it might very well be another kind of a Terminator 4 like CG movie with no real spark behind or worse yet - some kind of 2012 (sorry - this is a failed movie despite the spectacular effects). I had it before entering the cinema and exactly before the movie started. Then it all disappeared. It got me sooo much that I watched it twice in the theater, ad perhaps will go to watch some more.Another one of those few that should never be forgotten. Spectacular, out of the box thinking, super 3d stunning sound.I would tend to think this one is the winner of all times.Thank you James.",positive
508,"After revisiting the film after so many years it still has some really beautiful shots and scenes. The story isn't particularly unique and there are some striking similarities to the animated film ""Atlantis"". The similarities are so striking that the characters almost match character for character with the only difference being one is animated and the other live action . Both movies have the invaders attacking an indigenous group for a lucrative power source. The indigenous group in both movies even use their connection to the power source to ride their methods of transportation in a very similar way. The only difference being in Atlantis they use their power source necklace and in Avatar they use their tail.Looking at the overall picture, it's a fine story, but is heavily carried by its cinematography.On a last side note I did find it a little odd how quickly Jake Sully was able to move up the ranks despite his questionable actions. He managed to go from informant snitch that cost the lives of many of the indigenous to essentially the groups leader all by successfully mounting the largest banshee on the planet . Sure he helped redeem himself to an extent with his actions by the end , but I certainly wouldn't declare him a full blown hero either as was the idea.",positive
509,"I'd heard a lot of hype about Avatar, about its innovative technology and groundbreaking special effects, about all the anticipation, about the strong reviews and very strong opening weekend and Golden Globe nominations, and as much as I was intrigued, as much as I was wanting to see it, I was a little apprehensive. More often than not, hyped-up movies disappoint me, or at least underwhelm me. But this time, the hype was right. And this is one hell of a movie.True to the hype, the special effects are astonishing. And the 3-D used in the film was spectacular. Visually, it's one of the most amazing films I have ever had the privilege to see.Now, some people had indicated prior to my viewing of the film that the story and dialogue were a little weak. While I won't say it was the best-written movie of all time, and while I wouldn't hold my breath for a Best Screenplay nod at the Oscars, it was far from a bad script. At least, it didn't distract from the movie and leave a bad taste in the my mouth. Whatever it lacked in originality it more than made up for with the way it sucks you into its world and takes you along for a ride.And its world is well worth being sucked into. Such depth, such sheer creativity, in the world and its ecosystem, is unequalled. As alien as Pandora is, by movie's end, it seems perfectly natural, and the beauty and grandeur of its scenery and life-forms is staggering.Finally, the acting was competent, and ""right"" enough not to distract, though, again, Oscars are unlikely. The music is another matter; I expect Horner will at least get a nomination for his powerful score.Basically, all the individual pieces of this film are well-crafted, and they all seem to fit together into one tapestry that surpasses just about everything else in the movies of the past several years. I won't say it was 100% flawless, but whatever flaws it did have were minor, and completely shadowed by the magic of this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will eagerly await its DVD release. Highly recommended.",positive
510,"Don't get me wrong, technically Avatar might be one of the most spectacular movies created to date but if you see it from a movie stand point it falls between average and good. The acting was just horrible, the story we've seen/heard of several times for example dances with wolves, the last samurai. Maybe James Cameron should have spent more money on better actors instead of spending useless amounts of money on the technology. I can't believe that he took 4 years to make this movie. I am very disappointed. I think that Avatar is a very overrated movie and should not be in the top 250 at all, James Cameron is just an average director and Avatar was just another average movie with bad actors like Sam Worthington(Jake), Stephen Lang(Colonel) and always trying to be cool but is actually retarded Michelle Rodriguez(Trudy). I also must say that whoever wrote the script for the actor was either a red neck or a college bully. I see, you see?(Wtf)Overall I think James Cameron is just like Michael Bay, he only knows how to do one thing right and in this case its the animation/technical part of the movie and he left out the basics such as good actors, solid story line and obviously a good script to go with all of that. I watched this movie a second time before writing this review.",neutral
511,"Without doubt the most hyped and publicly marketed film in the history of contemporary cinema, Avatar has since dominated the big screen in all corners of the world, going on to generate over $2.7 billion in revenue and giving director James Cameron the highly- respectable title of having been at the helm of both the most, and second-most, financially successful cinematic endeavours of all time. Avatar takes us more than one hundred years into the future, where the Earth (played by the United States) sends a group of Marines to mine the foreign planet of Pandora for an extremely rare MacGuffin known as Unobtainium. Involved in this operation is the crippled Jake Sully, who is given the task of fusing his body with a cloned native in order to gain the trust of the planet's Indigenous population, the Na'vi, and convince them to flee their home in to accommodate the excavation of their sacred site. Along the way, Jake becomes more than friendly with the Na'vi princess Neytiri and begins to question the underlying motives of his employer.For many cinema goers, this film offered a comprehensively positive answer to the most debatable of movie topics: can a film made with the budget of a small (or, in this case, not- so-small) country which is made to appeal to the masses also be embraced by the critical community?Unfortunately, I'm not one of those believers. For pre-hype about Avatar to include such claims as 'it will revolutionise the way people watch and interpret cinema', it's fair to say expectations were pretty high. I walked into the film expecting a heavy dose of originality to complement the many socially conscious themes suggested by trailers, and ultimately implicated in the film's plot (including a criticism of America's involvement in the occupation of Iraq, as well as the need for us all to make our thumbs a little greener).What I got was same-old, same-old, Hollywood production-line stuff. A plot recreated dozens of times in different environments, coupled with a 'romantic' sub-plot lacking any sense of depth meant this was 'just another movie' in my eyes. I'm always open to give two thumbs up for innovation in film and, quite frankly, would have had no problem in seeing the closing credits roll following Jake's refreshingly insightful monologue about how 'we all have to wake up sometime.'Of course, the film dragged on for another 45 minutes, climaxing in a fierce battle scene allowing the special effects crew to show off to their heart's content, which was, that's right, thrown in to appeal to the masses.Despite this, I am impartially obliged to list three positives to come out of what was otherwise a disappointing film. Sam Worthington's portrayal of Jake Sully was, while by no means Oscar-worthy, leaps and bounds ahead of his previous enterprise in the dreadful Terminator: Salvation. The attention to detail offered in terms of the mannerisms of a paraplegic was something I was worried would be pushed to one side in the scope of such a grand undertaking, but Worthington did the role justice.Secondly, Avatar has given 3D cinema the push it needed to avoid being just some flavour- of-the-month promotion, and I for one am glad to see it hang around. Avatar is the first, and by no means the last, blockbuster to accommodate this revolution in filmmaking. And speaking of revolution, no one can voice their opinion on Avatar without mentioning the visuals. Not since our encounter with a real-life T-rex in Spielberg's suspenseful 1993 roller-coaster have computer-generated effects taken such a huge step forward. Now if only JC and company could have formed the plot, character development and dialogue to match.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",neutral
512,"I'm not really that old, but I've seen quite a few movies in my day. After Lord of the Rings was completed, I wondered if I'd ever be truly excited by a motion picture again. Well, James Cameron has done it with Avatar. There are the obvious cinematic innovations to acknowledge: carefully used 3D, the new motion capture technology, etc. The film just simply LOOKS great. I found myself giggling with joy at the pure beauty of so many of the scenes of Pandora (the alien planet) and its fauna. Cameron's time deep sea diving has obviously fired his imagination for strange and wonderful creatures. There is solid acting (particularly Stephen Lang, as the Colonel, who somehow pulls off a gritty depiction of a now very clichéd role), and there wasn't a single line in the script that had me checking my brain at the door. (There are some recycled lines, to be sure, but I didn't find them distracting.) Score by Horner was subtle, yet still moving. Frankly, though, what worked more than anything for me was the overall storytelling. A number of my friends were disappointed with the ""gone native"" tale, that has been ""done to death"" through previous works like ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Last Samurai"", but I didn't find it old at all. Rather, this is a fantastic re-imagining of the age old human tendency to colonize and obliterate other cultures and environments. Cameron is definitely spinning us a morality yarn, but it is one that cannot be spun enough times, and he does make every effort to make this iteration the most beautiful you will ever see. 10/10 p.s. Without any intentional hyperbole, I consider this to be the finest movie I've ever seen.",positive
513,"Avatar sets a new standard of movie watching. It's said before and i agree. Avatar is beautiful, new, fresh, amazing. The 3D is so natural, we are on Pandora with Jake. The story did we see before, boy meets girl. Its like Matrix, its like Dances with Wolves. Weve seen this kind of story's a hundred times. But it doestn mather. Its not that important. But every scene breaths love for cinema. The 12 year of waiting for a new Cameron was worth every day. And now we wait for more amazing movies. But first we have to see Avatar. And see it again, and again. This movie should be seen by everybody who loves cinema. AMAZING!",positive
514,"Back in the summer when i first saw the trailer of this movie, i thought why not i don't see this, it seemed like a mass production blockbuster Alien movie, with 3D screen, but i was wrong.. This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life.The movie is delivering an idea, i didn't think that i will find great performances from the actors and actresses in this movie, i enjoyed every second in this movie, the details are just perfect and i really think that this is James Cameron's masterpiece... Sam Worthington as Jack Sully, did a great job in this movie as an ex marine on wheeled chair,from the moment he was connected to his avatar he managed to give the viewer 2 different characters and did them both perfect. and Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, she managed to deliver emotions(Happiness, Sadness,betrayed, loving) through a computer generated character, and i think that was awesome . Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, she proved that she is a legend i really enjoyed what the art director did in this movie. i loved the every creature on the Planet Pandora, the soundtrack was awesome, i never though about been touched by two aliens in love. This is a must see movie, you cannot miss it, i rate it 10/10",positive

Maybe the best movie I have ever seen and God I have seen a lot. Definitely the best visual effects ever!!!! A little bit of crumby dialog but other than that the whole thing is a TEN. This movie has everything great acting, story, action, and effects. You must see this movie in theaters preferably in IMAX. The creation of the Na'vi is amazing above all the other things. I wish I were one of them. And an amazing love story also completes the film so everyone who goes will be satisfied. Yes, the story is one that we have heard before and is really nothing new but, it is a story we love and is told in a whole new way. Avatar is doing right now what Star Wars did for its time.

Now it is a very buy the books story, the movie often gets compared to Pochantis or Ferngully. But a movie telling the same type of story is nothing new at this point. So I judged on how well it told said cliche story and in my opinion it did amazing. The setting is absolutley beatiful,the creatures wild and filled with beaty everything is so creativly made, ending on am enderenalizing finale. But the length of the movie is felt and some characters being played by very talented actors still manage to fall flat to me.

518,"James Cameron's Avatar is the reason why I love movies. Avatar revolutionized my viewing experience once more just as Star Wars did.Starting with the plot and characters, others were right about the lack of originality in the story and some underdeveloped characters. I thought the characters weren't for us to know them but to 'feel' them. It was as if I was with Jake and Neytiri every step of the way, it was like a 'bond' as one of the movie's many themes suggests. I thought the story was told very well.I haven't seen Dances with Wolves but I could compare the film's story to Disney's Pocahontas. You could easily point out who is mirroring who and pretty much what's going to happen to them. Still, this was executed wonderfully that even if you knew where it's all going you still feel the thrill. Somewhere in the middle I lost my way for a while then quickly got back as things started heating up. I pretty much understand now why some people didn't like the movie for it's plot and character development. Overall having seen it my way, it's Epic. Acting is credible on both the live and computerized characters. The indigenous Na'vis looked and acted so real that you'd sometimes think them as better actors than the real ones. Not that the real actors did a bad job or anything like that.The visuals are nothing I've seen of before. I almost forgot to take a breath, my brain was stimulated to the awesomeness that is Pandora. A very unique and memorable experience. Ten years in the making resulted in nearly flawless detailing. It's worth every buck. This isn't just eye candy, it's an eye buffet.",positive
519,"Avatar was decent at best a snooze fest at worst.The FIRST 4 MINUTES
The first 4 minutes were really promising.
It gave us exposition but in a creative way in my opinion.
They set-up well who Jake sully is and it was just something i wanted to point out.CHARACTERS
All the characters are pretty bland.
The main character Jack Sully has no character arc nor any depth.
He was promising character with him not being able to use his legs and all that they could have gave him a desire based around that but after watching the movie i knew it wasn't possible cause Jake has a lot of desires.
First one is learning their culture which he succeeds in with no hardship.
Second protect the Tree.
So he shifts desire not having a clear and true goal which is pretty bad.
And he never changes during the adventure maybe a little bit but it wasn't enough.
Neytiri is also bad, i mean she has a character arc but it's not that good.
She first can't trust Jake and is pretty hostile with him, but then after sometime for no reason they start to like each other.
There was no conflict between them to they just like each other so that the plot can move forward.ROMANCE
The romance between Jake and Neytiri is actually not bad.
They like each other and then there is a conflict between them that pushes them away from each other and then they love each other again.
Yes it felt rushed but at least it's better than how Divergent or Incredible hulk or Twilight handled it.VILLAIN
Miles is a bad villain.
His motivation i think is that he dosen't care about those blue people and he does it for the money.
He dosen't really have any depth that make him a good villain and his death was really anti climactic.CGI
The cgi is very good and they put a lot of time making it look good.VERDICT
It feels like they focused more on the visuals than the story telling which made the movie not that good.
I checked RT on Avatar and they said that the story telling isn't that good but because the visuals are amazing it's a 8/10.
Ik RT is just a bot that and ik how RT works but whoever wrote that are stupid people.
They were aware of how decent it was but they ignored it.",neutral
520,"Have IQ's dropped sharply while I was gone? The overwhelming special effects of Avatar simply cannot hide the vacuousness of its story. As just about anyone who can read has noticed, the plot is a rehash of the ""civilised man goes native"" fable popularized from ""Last of the Mohicans"" to the present day (I'm sure even the ancient Egyptians have a version preserved in hieroglyphs somewhere on a dusty temple wall). The CGI is realistic enough that you can become engaged with the digital characters... except, then your attention is focused on the story. Which is almost as lame as a 6th graders summer vacation essay.I did not see the movie in 3D as I assumed it would be pointlessly distracting. I have seen polarized 3D movies before. Starting with one of the first, ""The Bubble"" in the late 60's. The peak of this in-your-face technology was reached years ago in the 70's with the release of ""The Stewardesses"". Nothing in this movie can compete with real 3D boobs.",negative
521,"I have been looking forward to seeing Avatar in 3D for some time now, so when I arrived at the IMAX theatre in Wimbledon on Saturday, my expectations were extremely high.Unfortunately this meant that I wasted the opening 5 minutes scrutinising every detail of the beautifully created 3D environment. Thankfully this was short-lived because once the story and characters grabbed my attention there was no looking back.I spent the next two hours and 40 minutes glued to my seat completely and utterly captivated by a truly unique and visceral experience that has left me aching for more.The basis of the story may not be the most original with similarities to 'Dances with Wolves' and to a lesser extent 'The Matrix', but this in no way impedes what is fundamentally a beautiful story of self discovery. The characters are engaging and the story is extremely well paced considering the length of the movie and at no time did I look at my watch and wonder how much longer the film had to go. In fact it was the opposite, as the story progressed I found myself worrying that it would end all too soon.I'm a huge fan of James Cameron so should not be surprised by just how good this film actually is, but the love and attention that has been paid to every single element of this film is evident, from the fantastic environment to the character relationships, it delivers on every level.Thank you James Cameron for giving us such a beautiful work of art, it really is something quite special.In case you didn't get the message: DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE.",positive
522,"I was beyond impressed, this movie was good in so many ways that it is hard to know where to start... So I guess it will be with the CG - These were by far the best effects I have seen in an movie, the integration of both live action and animation was seamless, I recommend it to be seen in 3D, because I caught myself swatting at what was 3D bugs flying around. The storyline was long but kept me involved so as not to become bored, and though I was warned it was kind of a ""Tree Hugger movie"" I did not get that, there was much more to the story than that, and should wake people up to how we should treat each other. My nest step is to see it again in IMAX-3D.",positive
523,"For some reason I decided to read the ""Hated It"" comments before writing my own. Almost without exception this pompous crowd opined that AVATAR was merely ""eye candy"" and nothing else; e.g., so-so script, acting, storyline, ending, etc.""Eye candy"" has been an feature of film for awhile now, only somewhere about 100 years, when audiences gasped at the moon beings in "" A TRIP TO THE MOON"". It was certainly scary candy to the early 20th century viewers who ran out of the theater when the train directly approached them on screen. We were still eating movie ""candy"" when the Mighty Kong climbed the Empire State Building. The rubber suited creatures in ""THE TIME MACHINE"" had me afraid for weeks. I also caught a buzz on the film that journeyed into the human body in a yellow submarine, certainly a thoughtless piece of fluff. Personally my ignorance is demonstrated by having loved, at 12 years old, a""JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH"" and other Jules Verne adaptations, not to mention just about any other flick starring dinosaurs, space creatures and dudes from beyond the grave.I might also point out an relatively unknown director named Steve Spielberg who has produced an abundance of mediocre fodder full of tricks and sentimental effects that captivated and pulled tears from a sap like me. It seems you cerebral brainiacs see right through those gimmicks that have me leaving the theater with tears and/or smiles.Why, I should've told my kids to dry those eyes and/or wipe those smiles off their faces and get down to some serious business!Message to the snob egghead crowd who believe themselves above a jolly good time. Stay home. Most of us wouldn't enjoy meeting you anyway. Apparently you were born 30 years old, infertile and over educated. If by some some chance you academics managed to actually parent a pre-teen who you took to the movies and who remained enthralled by AVATAR for the rest of the day, be sure to sit him/her down and instruct your son/daughter that such was just industry junk. I'm sure he/she will be the better for it.PS: To you nerds who believe me a complete idiot, Read some of my reviews on low budget domestic dramas and other stuff.

524,"As a prolific reviewer here, I have on many occasions encountered what I call ""first release shock."" Essentially a film so off-the-beaten-path, so unique, so different that, instead of appreciating it for what it is, initial viewers go into a sort of shock and become numb to what they are watching.This film is the poster child for that syndrome. On its own, it is one of the most daring, best written, best acted, best SFX'd, films of all time. It comes from a man (Cameron) who is known for blockbusters, but this is easily his greatest work.This film should rate a perfect score regardless of the rating system. But as explained above initial viewers did not know what to make of it. And the cost of the film became an issue for the studio when the numbers failed to meet expectations.It is not the job of the reviewer to worry about studio receipts. The job of the reviewer is identify brilliance and recommend it. See it six or seven times, it just gets better. One of the greatest films of all time and also timeless.",positive
525,"When Avatar first came out I didn't understand all the hype. I saw it in the cinema, and thought it was okay. I had very high expectations. I was only 16 years old then. I watched it a few more times afterwards, and thought much the same. It was very beautifully done with all the visual effects and with a story you've seen before, with the spy switching sides once he falls in love with an enemy, the foreign culture or the society he's invading.I am now 30 years old and just watched the movie again before the sequel. I noticed other things this time, and saw the film with new eyes and with different perspectives. I can understand others who think the film's story is clichéd, which I myself used to think and to some extent still think. It IS a predictable story. But... It's about so much more than just that. It shows how evil and disrespectful the human race is towards nature and other cultures. That humans can destroy something as beautiful as Pandora, blinded by greed and lust for power. Just as it is in reality. But reality is worse, since we are doing it to our own planet. This made me rethink the movie and made me appreciate it more than before.Movies are a lot about personal taste too, of course. This is certainly not a perfect movie, but I think it was better now than previous times I've seen it. I agree that the visual effects on the Avatars don't measure up to today's standard, but it did back then. Now I'm going to see the sequel.",positive

I was pleasantly surprised & came out wanting to watch the movie again & again.As the other comments have said, this movie is an experience.

527,"I was lucky enough to see Avatar with my friends on opening day. I wasn't expecting much, but I was hoping for a good film since James Cameron has directed two of favorite films (The Terminator and Terminator 2). When the movie finished, I was disappointed to say the least. James Cameron proved with the Terminator 2 and the Abyss that he could direct a movie that has good special effects and a good story, but Avatar is all about the Special Effects. The story is clichéd, Dances with Wolves in space pretty much sums up the whole movie. I knew almost instantly that the Colonel was going to end up being the bad guy. It's a shame that James Cameron didn't worry much about the story when writing the script, especially since he claimed that it was going to be the movie that reinvented movies. Three things saved this movie for me though, the acting, the special effects, and the last battle scene. The acting is great, some of the best acting I have seen in the past year. The special effects speak for themselves. Not once did I think that I was looking at CGI aliens, they look that good. James Cameron knows enough about Directing to show the good parts in the battle, instead of it just being a whole bunch of close up shots. In my opinion, had the movie been a little more focused on the war, it would have been a lot better. One minor thing that bothered me were the zoom in shots. It seemed like the cinematographer was using a hand-held camcorder, and they do this effect several times. It isn't one of the greatest films of all time, it should at best be placed 250 on the Top 250 list, but it isn't ""bad"". If you ever have about three hours to kill, spend it watching Avatar if you haven't seen it yet. If you have already seen it, I really don't see the point in watching it again.",neutral
528,"Very well made movie. The plot and storyline were epic, the visuals were stunning, and the music was also very majestic. It had an interesting twist with how you sometimes have to ""wake up"" from some of life's interesting moments. The movie had good action scenes and cool futuristic military equipment. Unique characters and some decent humorous moments throughout the film. There's not much bad to say about this film. It's practically one of the most thought out and detailed movies since almost any of the Star Wars films. And it all looks even more stunning on a Blu-ray disc (no joke at all, every detail is clear compared to other films on Blu-ray). I'm quite anxious to see there sequels when they come out.",positive
529,"This film, with that kind of world building, visuals and narration style, feels more like a triple A video game in story mode than a movie in retrospect from the twenties. But concerning that this movie came out at a time when smartphones weren't even a thing, one can only imagine how pioneering and groundbreaking it was at the time of initial release. The film struck a fair balance between telling the story while sprinkling in the underlying themes, with the advantage of powerful and striking visuals, helped elevate the emotional impact and bring out the message from the filmmakers as they obviously intended without making the movie feel too much like propaganda.",positive
530,"---May contain spoilers--- OK, so here we have Avatar, the most monstrously-hyped, obscenely expensive and ultimately biggest let down of a film in history.I'm not gonna lie, I was completely blown away by the fantastic visuals and thought. The CGI and special effects are breathtaking...I accept. However, this film just fails to deliver on so many levels. I would like to think of myself as one of the few individuals that saw this movie who was not blind to the glaring limitations thanks to being absorbed into the aesthetically pleasing elements of this film. NO THANKS!I am well aware that there are numerous reviews on the site that equal disaffection to the movie as I do but I had to chip in with my two pence because the fact that this film as become the highest grossing film of all time worldwide is not at all surprising but is utterly disgusting. The staggering global revenue of this film doesn't mean anything. What do you expect when you have a film twelve years after James Cameron's last cash cow of a film, Titanic, that swept the Oscars and generated obscene amounts of money? I suppose we can thank James Cameron for taking almost $300 million and producing a cinematic experience that is so vastly inferior to The Lord of The Rings and Star Wars in terms of imaginative scope. Thumbs up Cameron! I have to admit that the film had stacks of potential after the first half an hour. Sam Worthington, who played Jake Sully, an ex-marine who is sent to the world of Avatar as a one of the locals, falls in love, has to gain the approval of her father. I don't think we have ever seen these concepts in a film before. Oh wait...yes we have. The film, however, transcends shamelessly into a catastrophic blend of CGI-fuelled emotional emptiness and mediocre acting, excluding Stephen Lang, I liked him. The films ending is laughable! Truly pathetic. I cant remember ever being so bored watching a series of mindless explosions and gunfire in an imaginary world. Well done Cameron.So there you go, Avatar, an unbelievable visual extravaganza that fails miserably in every other aspect that film can. I will be extremely disappointed if Cameron pips his ex-spouse Kathryn Bigelow for the Best Director and Best Picture awards at the Oscars, not that the Oscars get many things right.Oh yeah! Almost forgot, the Avatar's live in a huge tree! Brilliantly inventive and exciting...oh wait on second thoughts, not so much. Calling Avatar a masterpiece and a breakthrough in cinema is bordering on unforgivable. 2/10 A point for the visuals and a point for the film actually being made.",neutral
531,"This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don't like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God's sake. This is full of spectacle, ""humanity,"" and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I'm surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren't complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren't as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.",positive
532,"I wont go into plot details, I will just tell you my feelings about this film, because it is so powerful I wanted to share this. I have now seen this film twice. The 1st time I saw it I rang my eldest son he asked me what I thought of it, I see many films love the cinema, my response was simple, It was the greatest film I have ever seen. He saw it the next day, I asked him what he thought he said the same. The 3d is stunning the story while simple is emotive during the film you are fully engrossed by the characters and their inter-relationships, it fully captivated me. I am going to see it for a 3rd time at the IMAX. My only fear is that I now expect even more from my cinematic experiences in the future. This is a classic and another brilliant film from Mr Cameron",positive
533,"The ground shook, and the crowd cheered. They wept. They gasped. They laughed. And finally, they applauded. What they experienced was something only a master can make, an adventure so spellbinding, so memorable, and so exhilarating that it's worth holding your bladder for almost 3 hours to sit through. It's worth tearing up behind 3D glasses. It's worth admitting that to your friends later. Finally, it's worth telling people that you saw this movie. I'm lucky to say I was a part of that group.Can anyone possibly set the bar higher than James Cameron? I think the only one who can set the bar higher is Cameron himself. He described it as his masterpiece, and that it is. Make no mistake: when seeing Avatar, know that you're witnessing cinematic history. Something directors like Peter Jackson only flirted with, Cameron mastered. Not only is Cameron's creation of a character astounding, but what truly sets Cameron apart from the rest is his ability to create a whole new world, where you can escape to, learn from, and bond to. At first, you'll be asking a lot of questions. ""Who's he?"", ""What was that?!"", ""Is that real, or CGI?"". But soon after...I can't say at what point, because I imagine it being different for each viewer, you'll become immersed in Cameron's beautiful Pandora, as he opens the box and reveals a beautiful new world to us as viewers.There are two kinds of Visual Effects, in my opinion. The first kind is the ""Transformers"" kind. These effects are the kind that wow you with their showy exterior, but are just there for entertainment. The second kind is the kind that enhances the background, works within a setting, and improves the overall viewing experience. Cameron did it with Aliens. He did it with Terminator 2. He did it for Titanic. And now he's done it again. At this point, he's just showing off. Cameron's incredible immersion into the world of Pandora is what makes it work. Without it, this is just some other alien movie. Cameron's impeccable attention to detail, such as whenever our characters are roaming through a forest, or flying on a winged beast...this is what gives the movie its life, its energy...which is what the entire theme and point of the movie is. Life is connected through us all, and Cameron's incredible work will bond every viewer through their love of movies and the very escapism Cameron provides.You'll notice that I've spared you a plot description. I believe this movie is best viewed with little or no knowledge. It helps with the immersion. Don't watch a trailer. Don't read a synopsis. I will say, however, that the true stars of the film are Zoe Saldana and Stephen Lang, who will undoubtedly go down as two actors who played their classic-in-the-making characters to perfection. Yeah, the screenplay is not a truly original product, and the film does play out in a semi-formulaic fashion...but this doesn't matter. It's the experience of Avatar that will move you, by what you're seeing, what you're hearing...and what you're experiencing. A beautiful score makes this seamlessly edited film flow even better, while the colors of the movie, so bright and vibrant, assure the viewer that they're about to have the most unique movie-going experience of their lives.I can't really recommend an experience like this more than I already have. I was on another planet for almost 3 hours. This is truly a movie to experience, a movie that makes us glad that we live in these times. It's the best motion picture of 2009, and one of the most revolutionary, immersing, and incredible movies ever made. I can say this without a doubt. Do not miss this.",positive
534,"I can't remember a time when a movie has ever lived up to its hype, but this one did. Avatar is a stunningly beautiful movie, but beyond cinematography and special effects there was excellent acting, very engaging characters and gripping storytelling. While some may consider the storytelling somewhat cliché, I would respond by saying that the simplicity of premise is more than made up for by the masterful way in which it is presented. This movie is simply a cinematic masterpiece and if there is any justice it will garner a lot of attention from the academy. It was easily worth the increased ticket price to see it in IMAX 3D. This one is a must see.For parents - you don't have any worries with sex or nudity in this one. The PG-13 is definitely for the violence, though even that avoids gore. Mostly explosions and some big alien creatures. Besides the violence, there's a little language, but really nothing you wouldn't encounter on television.",positive
535,"It's got the same balanced mix of cliché and easy watching pleasure as a Disney animation. Somehow it's a workable blend of military high-sci-fi in a Halo fashion mixed with the messages and visuals of something like a Miyazaki animation.Its obvious dialogue and simple plotting allows breathing room for the pioneering CGI and 3D and even though it's got a hefty running time, it's breezy and not as bogged down as it's other blockbuster counterparts. (See: Any Transformers). Here the CGI and technology is used to create believable, breathable worlds with stunning photo-realism. It's a great push forwards instead of the prior sterile all-CGI worlds before.Watching it on 3D Blu-ray for the first time, and it's really pleasurable. Considering it's influence on 3D, it doesn't push large objects such as characters to us. Instead the image is pushed beyond the window with sumptuous layers. It's always normal and always impressive. It's easy to forget you're watching 3D in a way that feels natural and is an absolute compliment. I think much of the reason 3D had failed is that many filmmakers neglect this subtle effect and instead push objects to us in obvious ways but like good score or photography, 3D is best used when it enhances and doesn't distract.Remember Sam Worthington? Because I didn't. Considering he's proven himself largely hollow and charmless, here, with the right character, it's easy to see why Hollywood glommed on to him so quickly. His Jake Sully is inquisitive and childlike, always eager to try hard. Enjoying himself. Despite him being a Marine, it's a refreshing change to the macho hogwash or teen angst of its peers. Saldana is great also, understanding how expressive and appropriately animalistic and charismatic she needs to be.But it's so obvious that Cameron wants to make Pandora the main character. And at that he has succeeded entirely in creating a world that I enjoyed visiting, learning more about, and want to visit again. Cameron has managed to create a world that is so utterly believable physically, which is the hardest part, with a sort of unified design and created ecology where I feel like I get it. The design overall is a little exaggerated much like in animation, the Robots are a little comical and everything is dialled up to 11, but why the hell not. The Na'vi faces are absolutely superb and flawlessly mocapped in a way that is hard to appreciate these days.So the simplicity of Avatar, much maligned, is a strength in many ways I think. It's exactly like a fun rollercoaster; colourful, brisk and yet a little bit longer than you want it to be but when it's over you could maybe do it again.Fun like a ride. I have to say I'm fully ready and willing for Avatar 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and whatever plumb new depths of Pandora and forge new cinematic technology.",positive
536,"Samuel Common ENG 101 WP#3 May 24, 2010 James Cameron has given us some of Hollywood's most notable films in history. His work is as diverse as it is compelling. From 'Alien' to 'The Abyss' his films are full of action and are intelligently crafted. As with many Hollywood action movies the plot and dialog often suffer as if that aspect has to be sacrificed in order to make way for the boom and bang of the film. With Cameron this is not the case as one of his greatest achievements 'Titanic' proved in 1997, which went on to be the highest grossing movie of all time. Hard to believe that one could do much better than 'Titanic' but one better believe it. I saw Avatar at the Arizona Mills Mall Imax in 3D with my fiancé'. Arizona Mills is a family oriented shopping and entertaining Megaplex. We were exhausted that day and didn't really want to go but we had already purchased the tickets. Despite not really having much of an idea what this movie was about going in we had heard that it was nearly 3 hours long and I couldn't imagine ANYthing that Hollywood could make that would be worth over 2 ½ hours of my life but I was pleasantly surprised. Avatar is not a movie, it's an experience. The characters are are REAL, you identify with them and their plight. Jake Sully (the main character) and the audience become one, we connect to him and his emotions, we actually care about whether or not he succeeds. The visual experience of Pandora is breathtaking. The audience is given a real treat, for nearly 3 hours we are no longer on this planet. No longer do we have the burdens of our jobs, the stress of the economy, the turmoil of our conflicting government, and all of the other things that weigh us down here on this planet. For nearly 3 hours we are in Pandora a beautiful, vibrant, pulsating planet that is alive and glowing with life. I couldn't help wondering if the Garden of Eden wasn't something like Pandora. I don't wish to spoil this experience for others so I am purposefully excluding details of the film, but if you are in the mood for something so new in it's concept, so creative in it's story and so beautiful in it's design then Avatar is the movie that you are looking for. 11 stars out of 10.",positive
537,"Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since Titanic Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clichés but somehow making it work. The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me wonder how much a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed to deliver. If you haven't seen Avatar(how?) you should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker.",neutral
538,"Sigh. Where to begin. This movie - the story I mean - had enormous problems right from the start. Jake's brother gets killed for ""the paper in his wallet""? What, paper money in 2154?? And where exactly did he get killed? On Pandora? A small corporate-military-scientific installation? Crawling with common thieves/murderers? Come on!And it goes on from there. All sorts of questions relating to the events and characters are never explained. What on Earth is unobtainium (an unoriginal term) used for, since it's so expensive? No explanation. The characters are total cardboards, incapable of mustering any audience identification or sympathy, with no cool lines, no good acting performances (except Zöe Saldana's), no nothing. The story is predictable and made up of clichés. I liked the ""Gaia plug-in"" thing they had, but having all the animals rise to the occasion at the end was just too Disney. The greatest plot hole was that the military could just have nuked the site instead of using a conventional assault. When they get back there next time, they'll probably do exactly that. So no proper closure, nor believable behavior, given the available technology.There were some cool scenes, sure. But without a good story and good characters and capable actors, cool action is utterly meaningless. This was a pretty package with no substance, just what you expect from average, mainstream Hollywood fare, made by a director who's compromised his integrity for money. The script sounded like Cameron wrote it when he was twelve, way waaay before getting around to mature and masterful work like Aliens and Abyss.This is the kind of movie that, because it contains something new (the CGI), will be a big hit now, but in just a few years it will be outdone by other movies and quickly look dated, and the cheesy story will relegate it to history's dung heap, deservedly forgotten.I had hoped this would be the SF movie of the decade. As it is, it's unintelligent schlock which will probably be toe-cringing to sit through a second time. What a freaking shame. 2009 only had four really good SF movies: District 9, Star Trek, Surrogates and Battle for Terra (which may have been made in 2007, but was released in 2009 - it is a much better version of Avatar than Avatar). Avatar certainly doesn't make my top-250 - nowhere near.6 out of 10.",positive
539,"Many reviews have stated that Avatar is unoriginal, that it is simply 'Dances with Wolves' in a different planet. Reviews who have stated this, also mention that the script is weak and that the characters need to be developed. I have realized that there are really two main viewpoints to those who have seen the film: 1) you observed and focused the ups and downs of the film (like a reviewer) 2) you did not observe and focus, instead you watched and 'lived' it. Now that I have put this into perspective, I believe the reason why many of the reviews state that the story is unoriginal, the script is weak etc. is because the reviewers fail to experience the film in its entirety. Reviewers are paid to review, their job is to highlight the ups and downs of a film, focusing and scrutinizing every detail. With Avatar, reviewers are not going to pay the film its full appreciation because they lack what is necessary to enjoy this film, which is to leave behind their ready and prepared criticisms. For those who had a viewpoint as no. 2... Well done! You appreciated the film as a whole, and truly did experience living in Pandora for two and a half hours, and that's what Cameron intended for his audience-to immerse themselves in this fascinating world of Pandora and experience the sorrow, laughter, anger and joy while watching Avatar. It is truly a film like no other, and what a film it is. Well done, Cameron, for delivering us another masterpiece.",positive
540,"with a 8.9 rating at the writing of the comment I would think this this movie would have to be something of a revolution. Alas , how far from the truth. The technological innovation in CGI makes Pandora no more real than Discovery channel documentaries. And a predictable pedantic storyline just does not go down my throat. This is a must watch movie just for the CGI. Nothing more , nothing less.More over there is nearly nonexistent acting. The characters are cardboard cutouts.All of the characters either murderous villains or sacrificing angels.More suited for a Disney family movie. It is neither the movie of the decade or anything. Hell it will struggle to be movie of the year.",neutral
541,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. I should have known by the way people talked about the ""looks"" instead of the plot. Imagine this film without CGI and it probably would be just another Saturday morning cartoon. If they had to use old-school costumes and make-up this thing would have fallen flat.The target audience seemed to be the kids who watch Saturday morning cartoons. The story line would only challenge the brain of a 6 year old.But let's cut straight to the heart of the matter: the CGI. OK, so the computer can create some neat images. Got it. But I find beauty more in the Discovery channel's ""Life"" and ""Planet Earth"" then in this movie. For example, the characters walk like those in Sim Life - jerky. The characters were nowhere close to the ""alive"" imagery of Toy Story.The beasts with the thick-skin were just another mutant thing and the ""horses"" were blocky and weak. The flying birds were the only exception to nice flow and appearance in my eye.And consider the way the final fight scene showed a robot (think Iron Man) that moved better than a human being can...all by a joystick. The thing weighs tons but moved like a ballerina. Please! When it reached above its head to grab the main character I started laughing...don't tell me the thing has eyes on the top of its head or a brain to operate it. Sad.Scene after scene was met with a furrowed brow. We have Weaver's avatar looking like a poorly animated Tomb Raider. We have Weaver wrapped in green vegetation (when, how and why left unanswered). We have futuristic helicopters (sort of) but old-school wheelchairs.We have a smelly alien somehow getting in good with the planet's inhabitants. And not just fitting in, but moving up the ranks to one of the top leadership position.We have a red bird (the rest are green-blue) that didn't pick him, broke the rule of ""only one bird"" and I'm not sure that was enough to convince the people that this fainting stranger could now lead 2,000 to victory.We have sleep pods that have a big red button on them, but in the future we obviously can't shut them down any other way. We have helicopters that can leave a military installation (with big doors) without resistance and without any pursuit.We have a big tree as the home that is destroyed and THEN we discover other clans exist and don't live in trees. Do they hook up their ponytails to the water, grass, or clouds? The race comes across as passive since they sat around and waited to be over-ran, yet every scene of the daughter's suitor indicated warriors. At the beginning they were feared for their size and poisoned arrows, but by the end the wooden sticks were laughed at. Which is it? Seriously, this was a cartoon. And had I sat down one Saturday morning to watch it with my nephews I would have wondered when it was going to end. Yuck.",negative
542,"""Avatar"" is, for all intents and purposes, hardly on the same level of visual medium as a ""film"". It is, it was, to me, an experience. An experience that I happened to witness in a movie theater (luckily enough in an IMAX 3D theater)...and during this experience I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I got excited, but most of all, I was entertained. Entertained, entertained, entertained.I knew going into the theater that Avatar would be cliché. I did. And I didn't care one bit. I was too preoccupied with the mind-blowing experience before me to care about how stupid a line was or how well I could predict the plot. With Avatar, it really doesn't matter. And to say this film would be nothing without its effects is like saying orange juice would be nothing without the orange. In other words, the effects cannot be separated from the film, NOT BECAUSE the effects make the film, but because story and effects go hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in a way that is not only appealing to the eye, but for the most part, the hearts of the mass audience.In a way, Avatar's plot not being the most original thing in the world was a good thing. Suppose it did have some wonderfully complex story - would I have enjoyed it as much? Probably not. It doesn't make Cameron lazy for not using original ideas...I mean, Pandora itself is pretty original for film-making (name a movie where a world has literally been created). This is the man who dreamed up the idea for Terminator, we know he has original plot ideas, he didn't need to prove that to us with Avatar.Avatar is probably the greatest film experience, ever.",positive
543,"I saw the movie in 3D. It was a night I was very sad because of bad family news, I was doubtful if to use the long time booked tickets. I have to say that during the movie I completely forgot all my troubles, I was in another world, much better then the real one, full of magic things and landscapes. This movie for me is a fantastic journey, that let your heart flight free in your child's fantasy. I think Cameron and his staff have done a fantastic job, writing a new page in movie history. I don't care the plot is not new, I like if good wins over the evil, but this is a true masterpiece, the future of movie will change. The 3D in the future could be improved.",positive
544,"I went to see Avatar this afternoon in 3d, and I must say; it was simply one of the most mind-blowing experiences I've ever been subjected to. The special effects were completely out of this world, and the attention to detail was astounding. Pandora is absolutely beautiful and it's crazy to understand that someone had the imagination to create such out-of-this-world imagery. The story-line was strong, and the characters where easily relate-able. What I believe to be, completely original piece of film-making, and a template for many movies to come. The three hours weren't a drag either, I was never bored. Fantastic Performances by Sam Worthington and Zoe Salander as well as an impressive supporting role performance from Giovanni Ribisi I suppose there's nothing more I can say thank to tell you to watch it and see it for yourselves!",positive
545,"I loved avatar and I'm happier than anyone there's going to be a sequel but I must say it was a ballsy move to, after over a decade, not only make a sequel but confirm 3 more movies that are going to follow that without waiting to see how the sequel does. In preparation for that avatar was re-released in theatres so I went to watch it.It really was a breath of fresh air, something completely new in the genre. It's shocking it wasn't 'based' on a book. I've come to then learn it's a scifi retelling of the colonial history of north and South America with the conflicts between the military groups and indigenous people. Made me appreciate the movie even more now.The faith and beliefs of the Na'avi made it more than just an alien movie with big guns and exotic forests because there's actually something worth fighting for, something to lose. There were stories to tell, one of which Jake Sully's who in my opinion didn't really feel like an actual marine, it's not down to the actor playing him but more of how his character was written. That's literally the only thing I think it could have done better.There was great action, most notably in the third act when it became just an action flick. Coupled with the great cgi it was really captivating to watch on the big screen, as well as the beautiful scenery all throughout the movie. I was most impressed by how well everything is thought out, it's not just some other ambitious sci-fi that relies on it's visuals and action scenes. A lot in Pandora was based off things and ideas of animals, tribal culture and how people people treat their faiths, these are things we're familiar with in real life or other sci-fi movies, so it felt like you could relate with it but still had a unique feel.Adding to concepts that felt familiar, Jakes addiction to his avatar life which could be compared to someone into virtual reality or games, reminds me of Ready Player One. So as much as this was a unique sci-fi it felt like a coming together of every sci-fi book and comic you've ever read, as James Cameron himself said.There was also a love story being told, a bit generic with someone falling for the enemy after realizing they aren't on the right side; but I'm a sucker for romance so even though it isn't as a prominent feature of the movie it was still important to the plot and I loved seeing it.Nearly 3hrs long but it went by quickly as it wasn't plot heavy, could've been squeezed into a shorter runtime but why would you want to. I wasn't as emotionally invested or in awe as I was during my first viewing but this was still a beautifully made and captivating science fiction masterpiece, and I'm looking forward to watching The Way Of Water.",positive
546,"Visually unassailable!  Acting, directing, special effects are ALL top notch!  However, the theme and subtext leave everything to be desired!

James Cameron is a genius when it comes to entertaining us with one of the most memorable ways possible... through cinema!What i liked the nost about this was not just the cast but the story, this tale is so entertaining that it keeps you engaged in this epic story that you just feel no matter the time you bave to finish what you started.What an experience this truly was, an experience that is best deserved to be shared, you really need to see this if you havent yet.Highly recommend! Great film!",positive
549,"The dialog, plot and overall action of this movie was unremarkable from a story standpoint. In fact the dialog was downright bad. Some lines were picked straight out of previous movies, including Cameron's Aliens, such as a Sgt. calling his troops ""ladies"" which has been copied to death in other movies that followed Aliens, making the dialog sound dated at times.The story was also predictable and formulaic and we've seen it all before... humans come to a new world, want something, and take it at the expense of the natives. Sci-fi fans that like sciencey plots that challenge the mind will find none of that here.Even much of the action was repeating what worked for Cameron before, like the famous scene in Aliens where Ripley is strapped in a loader doing battle with Mommy Alien. Star Wars, Iron Man and several other movies have used the loader-type artillery machines, and Avatar does too, particularly in a key scene near the end, delivering the message that you've seen it all before, and now you are seeing it yet again.For all of these reasons I found Avatar disappointing in a way I wasn't expecting. I expected more out of Cameron's writing. But Avatar did have one major strength that will ensure it is a huge success, because no other movie has it... and this is where Cameron put all his marbles.Avatar has a planet no one has seen before that is filled with exotic forests, plants and animals that are entirely original and fascinating. Cameron's wild imagination explodes in the habitat of the Na'vi, and will not likely disappoint viewers. The time involved in creating such a lush world with so many different life forms and plants boggles the mind. (And of course he invented or helped to invent much of the technology to film it too.) On this count, Avatar rates a 9.5. With its story getting a 5, dialog a 4, and the movie being overlong for the story it told, I'd give it 6 or 6.5 overall, but it will probably be a 6.5'er you will enjoy, despite its many weaknesses.",neutral
550,"Years ago when Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was released (2001), it set a benchmark for rendered animated actors in a movie. I remember reading about the hundreds of hours of rendering time it took to make and was in awe of the animation. Man have we come a long way! Thanks to Moore's law, computing power has nearly tripled since then and the complexity of animation that's capable now blurs the line between CG and live-action & effects. Cameron has reportedly spent MILLIONS of $ on this movie and it shows in every aspect of the movie. Cameron is a master at telling a story and what I HATE in a lot of movies using live action and animated/CG characters is certainly absent from this movie. I SO hate it when some CG monster pops out at the actors and it HAS to roar (or do some OTHER formulaic action that's been miserably repeated ad nauseum in other movies) and stands there for a few seconds looking menacing and THEN it attacks our main character(s). I think Cameron must have did some homework and observations in nature to see how animals and such respond to threats and aggress in the wild. That part I feel he got pretty bang on and you CAN feel hair rise up on your skin and some semblance of what the character would probably be feeling. One example is when Jake accompanies the two scientist as a guard and is chased by some kind of creature. You can literally feel the panic, the branches banging on the characters face, and the wind as the creature takes swipes at him. I also like that the character's CG looked about 95% lifelike and not hyper-rendered or ultra-fluid. We CAN see the state-of-the-art in Avatar. The CG animation is ALMOST 100% like-like. Better than anything we've seen to date. When you encounter an animated actor in other movies, you can tell right away they are animated as they just don't have that certain human gait to their mannerisms and expressions. Cameron has pulled an ace out of the hat with the CG in that respect. I would guess a LOT of characters in the movie had some kind of motion-capture applied to them as they appeared vastly more realistic to what we recognize as motion and expression in the natural world. OK, on to the story and other elements.I can see some of the elements of what people say with regard to Last Samurai and Dances With Wolves BUT this is not THAT kind of movie. If you don't want to know TOO much of the movie, skip this part NOW! We learn that humans have pretty much plundered and rendered their own world sans ""green"" and have traveled 6 years (light years?) to a planet called Pandora because it has this stuff called Unobtainium (probably because it's unobtainable on earth, could have had a better name but I ""get"" why it's called that, slight allusion there) that goes for 20 million an ounce (or some such measure of weight) and the aliens are sitting on a mother-load of it. The human have been trying to court the aliens to swindle them...I mean, relocate them so they can dig up the Unobtanium. That's as much as you'll need to know in terms of premise of the movie. So with that, you can see the allusion to the ""white man"" coming in and taking away the Native American's land for a few baubles and beans. I think it was Cameron's intent to liken the aliens to Native Americans as it gives the story a bit of accessibility and digs into our collective past and how we treated the Native American's when ""we"" arrived. What it boils down to is Cameron saying to his audience that we as humans need to do a much better job of taking care of what we HAVE rather than progressing towards being a people who take from others and will ignorantly kill anything and anyone just to get what we THINK is ours.Overall, I don't agree with others saying this is the Star Wars of this generation. I thought the story was worthy of Cameron's name and his production and direction of this movie will not be rivaled ANY time soon. You will not notice the 2 1/2 hours length of the movie. Yes, it is THAT good. I look forward to watching it on BluRay or in 3D to see what I am really missing. If you walk away from this movie thinking ""stupid CGI, pro-alien, and anti-human"", you missed the whole point of the movie. BUT, if you walk away thinking that even if we ever live long enough or advance far enough to explore other worlds, we should always remember that if there is life already on another planet, it was there, long, long, LONG ago before we showed up.",positive
551,"AvatarThis motion-capture film is directed by James Cameron. I saw it in 3D Imax, and I recommend that version for the effects. The plot is nothing special: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.Our hero is Jake Sully, and he's a paraplegic whose twin brother died. His twin was scheduled to control an avatar on the planet Pandora, an avatar cued to his DNA. Since they were twins, Jake can take his place but hasn't had the training, so we get to watch Jake get all the stuff explained to him so we know what's going on. Obvious plot device. Generally, the planet Pandora has a mineral we want for commercial purposes, but the planet is inhabited by people who are connected physically and spiritually to the entire planet and its biosphere, and these people don't want us taking their stuff. Jake is sent to the planet's surface where he assumes the shape of a local inhabitant through the magic of science - he's an avatar with full mobility again. His goals are (a) get the inhabitants to agree to us taking the mineral and (b) failing that, discover how to destroy their home most effectively so we can take the mineral with least cost (in lives and money). Naturally, Jake falls in love and becomes one with the planet himself. He leads the aliens to a successful uprising against the hostile corporate take over.The plot has been compared to ""Pocahontas"" and ""Dances with Wolves."" I'd guess that's fairly accurate. It's not a bad movie as movies go - good action, great effects. The bad guys are too cartoonish for my tastes, and the ending is deus ex machina, which I didn't like. However, the 3D Imax experience overwhelmed my sense of good film and gave me enough pleasure to like the movie.The effects people and the art and visual designers really knocked my socks off. One of the problems with computer-generated imagery and motion capture movies is the sterility of the ""sets"" and the lack of grounding of the characters in the world they're supposed to be inhabiting. When real people walk the real ground, they affect the ground - when cartoon characters walk on the ground, there's no disturbance. ""Avatar"" gets around this in part by having a world that is phosphorescent, so when the characters step on things, the things glow. In other scenes, however, the computer-generated characters float on the ground without interacting with it. There's no real feedback from the environment to the characters.The visuals were compelling - I got a little motion sick from some scenes, just as I would have in real life. The 3D camera work really works - I felt some of the objects were definitely in front of the movie screen - and Cameron didn't play it for cheap thrills. (They were very expensive thrills.) I think ""Avatar"" is a major step forward in motion picture production, comparable to the coming of sound and color.There are, of course, problems. Motion capture means we see computer-generated characters. Whether you care about what is basically a cartoon is not something I can predict. I don't foresee motion capture as a wave of the future, but that may be a reflection of my generation rather than an accurate forecast. My habit has been to see and care about characters played by Jimmy Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Morton Downey, Jr., George Clooney; Meryl Streep, Audrey Hepburn, Tilda Swinton, Ingrid Bergman.Additionally, the bad guys were so overdone they left me vaguely sick. There were no redeeming virtues - the bad guys were bad all the way through. We had no background that gave us reasons; we had no internal struggles with what would have been right. I'd contrast these cartoons with Heath Ledger's The Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" His character was fully developed, and we understood his evil and felt sorry for him. In ""Avatar,"" Quaritch and Selfridge had no depth.Ultimately, the world Cameron created and the story worked for me. I think, though, that seeing it in 3D Imax made a significant difference from watching in 2D. I recommend seeing the film in 3D if at all possible. I think the 3D Imax effects cover up a lot of sins.NOTES ABOUT IDEOLOGY AND SOME American OBJECTIONS. SPOILERS.Some Americans see this movie as anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-religion. While I'll lend some credence to those points of view, they're overblown. I've read about pre-literate humans and their rituals for thanking the animals for sacrificing their lives so that the humans might eat them, and the aliens in ""Avatar"" have this same ritual. I think having it here helps establish the world of the aliens and connects me to it: their world is the world of our Stone Age ancestors, where everything is connected and life is lived among creatures who have a right to exist. This is the basis for the objection to taking the minerals from the planet. It all has a right to exist. By casting the villain as corporation with military muscle, Cameron picked an obvious target. He did it badly, though, and that's my objection. It's possible to read the movie as a rant against the rape of our planet. It's possible to read the assault on a Stone Age populace as an attack on American military ventures in the Middle East. It's possible to see the exposition of the alien ""religion"" as an attack on American monotheism. I though it was just a movie with good action and great special effects. It wasn't good enough for me to take seriously as a metaphor for anything. From my point of view, the people who were offended by the movie tell me more about themselves than they do about the movie. Your mileage will vary.",neutral
552,"Is there any creativity left in Hollywood? This movie is like a collection of clichés we've seen over and over again. It is pure escapism and nothing more.Why would we focus on earth when we have this blue planet where we can simply start over again. So far the idea of the movie add some battle sequences and a few million dollar special effects and you have yourself a blockbuster.What I really don't understand is why the na'vi people are almost exactly like the native Americans. I think you would at least try to cover up that the movie is just like ""Dances with wolves"". Except the character development and engaging story of course. A good film if you have some time to kill and don't want to think to much. Butt I cant help thinking it could have been so much better with some more creativity and thought.",negative
553,"You know the story from the trailers, you know the director has been working on it for the better part of two decades. So the question is this the film that revolutionizes film? 3-D films in the past have been notorious for breaking the fourth wall needlessly, but Avatar is full immersion 3-D. At no moment do you look at the Na'vi and remember you are in a theatre. Some critics complain that the run-time is far too long, but when Jake is spending time on Pandora you feel as if you are emotionally invested in each and every one of the people and places.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paralyzed former Marine joining the Avatar program after the death of his brother. With his new Avatar he can walk again and once he infiltrates the Na'vi and convinces them to move away from their land based on a very valuable deposit of Unobtanium, Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) promises to get Jake's ""real legs back"".Avatar is one of those moments in film that cannot be missed, this is bigger than Lord of the Rings, The Dark Knight, or any movie of this decade. This is the wonderment in cinema that has been missing for so long. Cameron firmly establishes you into a new world filled with some of his old mainstays. There is no lack of strong female characters - something that has been lacking for far too long. If you didn't know any better you would almost say Sigourney Weaver's Ripley had returned in the form of Grace. Zoe Saldana's Neytiri is going to launch her career in a way that Star Trek didn't. Instead of playing the eye candy she embodies a brave warrior that drives the story and rehumanizes Jake.Welcome back James Cameron, we missed you.",positive
554,"Amazing movie. The most fantastic movie I have seen in 20 years. As a matter of fact ever, since there is nothing like it. Just go and watch it. I went in expecting something special, and it really is something else. Absolutely fantastic universe created here. The visuals are absolutely stunning. And all the details are mind boggling. This is really a movie where you cannot give people an idea just by describing the plot. They just have to go see the movie. I just want see the movie once more. My son who's 11 years old said the same. He could not forget this movie, and want to go see it again. It is not the story but the way it's presented. A must see.",positive
555,"After being out of the public eye since Titanic(1997), his comeback film Avatar proves to serve him right.Way forward in the future a crippled marine(Sam Worthington), becomes apart of an experiment, When he is hooked up to machine, it can put his mind and soul in the body of a 8 foot tall blue alien, and has to go undercover on there planet, to get some of there resources, but things change when he falls in love with one of the alien warriors(Zoe Saldana).This film is quite a masterpiece, it's mind blowing in any effects and storytelling ever. Sam Worthington who stole last years Terminator Salvation from a cranky Christian Bale, really does well here. So does Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver. A great comeback for James Cameron.",positive

557,"It represents a conflict pretty much like the one between the native-Americans and the European colonists. The Navi with their culture, religion and way of life resemble well to the American Indian tribes. Only that the movie shows not a thing about wars between the Navi tribes, that are a fact in the history of native-American tribes, and that contributed in a significant way to the extermination of the Indians by the European immigrants: had they been united and acted like one nation it would have been much more difficult to destroy them (see also what J.F. Cooper says about those wars in The Last of The Mohicans and what Karl May says in Winnetou on this topic). Could an underdeveloped and non-industrial population win a war against a highly technological society? Definitely not! Yet Cameron comes up with that insurrection of all living things on the planet against the humans, which resembles somewhat with the way the Jedi in Star-Wars manipulated animals - and even some intelligent, yet not too intelligent beings - in order to turn the tables. Otherwise, I appreciate as very significant that the humans wanted ""unobtainium"" on that planet, which is a transparent pun, rendering well the reality that man always searches something that is unobtainable. Yet the unreal aspect is that those Navi are presented as some that ""are living their own dream"": no conflicts, no unfulfilled desires. That doesn't match any population in the history of mankind, which leads us to the conclusion that, if such a thing really exists, it must be on another planet. The special effects save the movie, that otherwise wouldn't be worth a dollar (unlike other movies, that are rather low budget, but show more real things).",neutral
558,"Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, T2. The man named James Francis Cameron has etched his name into sci-fi genre (and as a film-maker par excellence) with almost as much intensity as Hitchcock did in the suspense/ thriller genre. We know that he makes technically brilliant and supremely entertaining movies. I wonder why he blanked out on the most important aspect of movie making on this one - and no, I'm not talking about life-like CGI or agile animatronics or even 'human-emotion capture' computerized actors. It's a simple story: it's 1500s in 2100s. It's the oft-told tale of Europeans coming to the new world and taking away the pristine goodness of it all. I won't fault the story, simple stories are good. We connect to those. Now, narrative - I'd have liked to think that Mr. Cameron thought that all of us weren't 8 year olds (no offense meant to the 8 year olds!). We are required to suspend belief not just on the fact that a completely alien ecosystem evolved sentient beings who are strikingly similar in all aspects (physical, cultural, psychological) to humans, but also on human race's own progressive cultural evolution as well. The marines are caricatures from a bad Vietnam-Era movie, the corporate boss is from an equally bad 80s investment bank ('screw the science, I gotta make me some money baby') and we are still letting vets ride around in wheelchairs that are driven using the manual power of their hands. The psyche of avatar-wielding protagonist is never explored fully. What makes him 'switch-over' to the other side (some emotional complexity please, it needn't be a Christopher Nolan a la 'The Dark Knight' but just a little more internal confusion might be more, well, human?). And Pandora is many things, it's beautiful, scary and enthralling - but there's one thing it's not: it's not alien. It's just an idealized recreation of how 'jungle people' would live dreamt up by a bunch of people who live in high-rise condos or sprawling houses. At the end of it all, I'm left asking - why aliens? Why did this movie have to take place on the moon of a giant planet many light years away? This story could have been more than adequately told in umpteen number of 'conventional' settings: Incan Americas, India of early 16th century,West Africa of late 17th century. I have too much respect for the director to think that the answer is - because we could put a CGI super-tiger that looks like it could have a T-Rex for breakfast fighting an animatoric robot on a giant 3-D screen. But from the looks of it, the answer is probably very close to that.",neutral
559,"this movie is a visual masterpiece. In essence a virtual magic mushroom trip if you have ever seen the allman bros in the beacon theater you will love the colors in this movie , the story was very emotive and there was a lot of subtext that involves our present and past worlds, basically I look at this movie as a message of love,and also as a labor of love .The bar has definitively been raised for other filmmakers , the 3-d is out of this world,the sound and background sounds were unreal and overwhelming , the actors were very well cast and filled their there parts extremely well.

560,"A visually brilliant if not stunning work, but let down by having a highly derivative plot line - almost a cliché - being basically a ''Reverse Pocahontas Guilt Trip'' - (i) Reverse Pocahontas - because the main protagonist fell in love with a native girl and who then went native (in Pocahontas its the native girl who fell in love with the foreign invader and went abroad). Yawn - haven't we been there & done that before? (ii) Guilt Trip - James Cameroon basically spent US$200mil filming a thinly disguised apology to the Taleban here. Switch ''Navi'' with Mujaheedin, switch Pandora with Afghanistan and the plot survives almost identical - as a thinly-disguised apologia rooting for the local insurgents combating highly-armed foreign invaders against huge odds in an asymetric contest. Its like Rambo - except that Stallone refights Vietnam to make Americans feel good, but in the Avatar it seek to make America's conscience feel bad.",neutral
561,"Yes, the story may be predictable, yes, the message may be predictable so if you are one of those people looking for a picture ""with depth"" this may not be the movie for you. If you want ""drama"" and well developed ""dramatis personae"" then stay home. This movie is for Trekkies, and Star Wars, Blade Runner fans. In other words, this is for the person who wants to be entertained. For the person who wants to see amazing graphics and action. For the person who wants to escape for almost three hours from the daily grind of daily life. I went to see this with my family and thought that it was and amazing blend of CG graphics and action and adventure. I was able to spend the time imagining living in another world far from the crap we have here nowadays. I recommend going to see it in 3D and I could only imagine what it may have looked like in Imax but since we don't have one of those near by then I'll settle for the ""standard"". But yes, if you enjoy wallowing in in ""drama"" save you money and stay home and watch reruns of ER or Hill Street Blues or whatever, but if you just want to have fun then for Pete's sake go watch this thing it WAS GREAT!",positive
562,"For a sci-fi thriller and special-effects buff that I am, this movie significantly lacked appeal.The blending of live action and CG was far from perfect. It lacked the refinement that was exhibited, for example, in animating Gollum, who supposedly was one of the triggers for Cameron to start working on Avatar again. I don't know if it was intentional, but the obviously fake graphics didn't do very well to help the suspension of disbelief and added more confusion to the actual character (animation vs. live action) of the movie.The shapes of the alien life-forms were done very well but the colours and textures were very childish, especially with all the glowing things everywhere. Human gadgetry was a mixed bag but the space shuttle that was transformed into a bomber was the most pathetic piece of flying machine design I've seen in a recent sci-fi movie.The plot initially had the potential of being very complex and interesting but the screenplay makes it degenerate into a very simplistic fairy tale, the height of which was Jake's riding of the Toruk (the most fierce flying creature on Pandora). At least we deserved to see how Jake accomplished such a difficult task, in greater detail.All in all, this movie had a wonderful fantasy environment that the viewer could enjoy for some time but fail to connect with thanks to a grave lack of effort in making the audience believe that Pandora could be real. The childish screenplay adds to further disconnect for adult viewers and, despite a good story, in the end it remains a popular fantasy geared more towards children.I can easily think of a dozen movies released in the last 10 years that were way better than Avatar for sci-fi and special effects.",neutral
563,"The special effects are fascinating, but the characters and plot are as trite as they can be. There's no message here that is not present in many Hollywood westerns, or any film concerning imperialist intrusion into a primitive way of life. To sum it up, If Whitey Wants Your Natural Resources, He'll Tear Up Anything To Get Them. From the 15th to the 19th centuries the world learned this lesson from the Spanish, French, Dutch, Portugese, and English. I laughed out loud when I realized that Giovanni Ribisi's character wasn't kidding when he referred to the object of his mining project as Unobtainium. That word has been used colloquially by motorheads for at least 35 years as a way of referring to any expensive, high- tech metal, especially titanium and magnesium. I don't know whether James Cameron thought he made it up, or if he heard a couple of bikers talking in a parking lot and absorbed it subliminally. Either way, it turned what was intended to be a significant scene into a big chuckle. The only reason I gave this overlong cartoon more than 2 stars is the fact that I admire the effort of the actors, as well as the technical expertise of the CG people. The fact that this was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards tells me that either: (A) the choices that year were few; or (B) the members of the academy have lost all taste and perception. As long as the viewer doesn't expect Avatar to be great cinematic literature. she or he can probably be entertained and not disappointed.",neutral
564,"Just got back from my second viewing of Avatar in the stunning imax 3D and it was even better this time around. I wont go into the storyline as you probably already have an idea of this and i don't want to add any spoilers. The storyline itself is simple but not unintelligent and keeps you gripped from start to finish. There is lots of action, battle scenes, sci fi, and a love story to keep you occupied. The special effects are amazing and the attention to detail is brilliant but this is not just a fx showpiece like 2012 was, there is depth to avatar. I just could not see how anyone could dislike this, the 2 and a half hours drifted by and left me wanting more. James Cameron truly is a master of movies. Perfect movie.",positive

Yes it is that good and anyone that reviews this badly either has not seen this incredible movie or... well quite frankly, I can't see why they would. It doesn't matter what kind of movie you like, it pretty much covers it. I'm truly glad that we have such a talented writer/producer as James Cameron to create such great entertainment. It might have taken him long to create this one, but it's certainly worth the wait! DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!",positive
566,"James Cameron did it again after 11 years of Titanic. His new directorial venture Avatar is simply masterpiece and sets a new standard in film making. However the story is bit inspired from Pocahontas kind of situation but this has been compensated by fast paced presentation of each developments & twists. I was in awe how 170 minutes passed because of crisp screenplay.The visual effects are perhaps the best since Lord of the Rings. On acting side, Sam Worthington as Jack Sullivan was convincing. His positive aura and decent look worked well. He is actor to watch out. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were also did there job effectively.The lush vegetation and ferocious animals of Pandora were breathtaking. Everything looked so real. The sound effects were also something I haven't experienced before and I liked.The entire credit goes to James Camroon and only James Camroon. The film does live upto its expectation.

Everyone from elders to kids were enjoying and clapping in the theater.Please don't miss this one in theater as big screen is better for this big venture (in terms of content and not budget).",positive
567,"Avatar is centered on the Human mission to a planet known as Pandora, in which it took just over five years to reach. In the story, Humans have depleted their resources at home and are in search of a new mineral on Pandora referred to as ""Unobtainium."" The native humanoid race on Pandora, known as the Na'vi, are resistant to humans and their machines and their guns. The Na'vi live in harmony with everyone and everything on the planet, and have ways of bonding with them.I don't want to spoil it, but it's worth every bit of the nearly 3 hours the movie is. The CGI is phenomenal, as everyone says. The story, albeit, has some obvious hooks to the roots of great movies before it. However, I feel like Cameron tells it with a brand new twist through the whole movie.I saw the movie in 3D, and the 3D was interesting although in my opinion not worth the extra five bucks I paid. It did bug me that they told me to recycle my glasses, especially since the DVD will likely have a 3D feature and I will be glad I didn't.Now, however, I am faced with a dilemma.

569,"Whether you just like Avatar or worship Avatar will seriously depend on how much you buy into its message. Avatar is actually a mediocre movie. The only reason some people are giving Avatar a 10/10 is because they're blindly accepting its themes. For those of us who are old enough and informed enough to know that: a) environmentalism is just another false religion b) most of the indigenous peoples of the world have embraced modern technology and the global economy c) the scientists who disagree with Global Warming are being silenced d) the population of the earth is going DOWN not UP e) global resources (such as trees) are not being over-used and can easily be replenished using modern technology... Avatar is just another piece of leftist, Hollywood nonsense. As many people have pointed out, the plot (and pretty much the entire script) has been ripped off from other movies with the same ""save the planet and tribal people"" theme. Personally, I'm getting tired of it.",neutral

The final battle scene is 20 minutes long and absolutely mind-blowing.The SFX are impeccable and he uses them well. Instead of just shoving them in your face, he weaves them into the story beautifully, and they come off effortlessly. Actors and director's credit, the performances came through extremely well. It's amazing how much of the actors emotions you could see through their Avatar characters. Zoe Saldana gave an especially emotional and strong performance, and you never even saw her real face",positive
571,"I was looking forward to Avatar. I saw it on the second day it played and paid the extra money for the 3D. I enjoyed it, but it's far from the benchmark film some have been claiming.First the motion-capture technology is fine when used to replicate body motion, but not facial expressions. It can duplicate basic broad facial movements, such as anger or laughter, but anything subtle is simply not there. You still relate to the alien characters as being animated and the earth characters as being real actors. We're obviously expected to not be aware of any difference between animated characters and real actors, but there is a substantial difference. There is also a huge lack of original ideas for both technology and the creatures inhabiting the planet. Star Wars, Alien, 2001 A Space Odyssey or even going back to Fantastic Planet, gave the public technology and environments which had never been seen on the movie screen before. It's not that these films were absolutely original as they did borrow ideas. But when they did borrow, for the most part, they were not from other films and so it was new to the general public. Avatar just borrows too heavily from other movies we've all seen. For heaven's sake, did the bad guy REALLY have to get into one of those giant robotic suits for the climactic battle? Technologically, there is nothing in here that compares to the first time the public saw the space station wheel in 2001, or the H.R. Giger sets of Alien, or the giant planet walkers in Star Wars. Then there are the animals which inhabit the planet which look far too similar to earth animals. Basically, the alien tigers look like tigers and even the dinosaur-like creatures, well, look like dinosaurs! And the action scenes, somehow didn't generate the excitement they should have. For example, when they were flying on the backs of the giant bird-creatures, I never felt the particularly thrilled by it. A flying scene like that should have made you feel a sensation of vertigo. I was thinking that it might have been because the jungle environment was so strange and foreign that you had no sense of height the way you would in a city scene when buildings give your mind something to relate to. But I think there may have been a bigger reason. Greater importance was given to hammering home the message of the film, rather than simply being caught up in the action. So, flying on the backs of the birds was to show ""the majesty of the natural world"" instead of just the thrill of it. And the battle scenes were not the battle scenes in a Star Wars film, because it simply more important to feel the sorrow and horror of war. Compare the actions scenes in Avatar to Dark Knight and there is no comparison. The only place Avatar excels is in the depth and detail of the planet. The jungle is probably the star of the movie. However, I could just go to an Imax showing of the real Amazon jungle and get the same experience.If you keep your expectations reasonable, you'll probably enjoy Avatar. But this isn't the new Star Wars.",neutral
572,"I've seen this film twice in 3D and was completely blown away each time. Hands down the best movie of 2009! It totally lived up to its hype and deserves all the credits and praises it's received.Surely it's not the most original story in movie history (then again what really is original these days?), but it's still a good story and it's very well-told and beautifully executed. The movie is also very easy to follow and easy to get absorbed into. If you like most people who have seen this movie, you'll be automatically lost yourself in the world of Pandora after 10 minutes into it without even realizing it. The CGI is the most realistic and beautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. The details are just so exquisite and breath-taking. It's hard to believe all the creatures and sceneries on Pandora was digitally created! It totally put films like Transformer 2 or 2012 to shame in the CGI department, not to mention the former had a much better story than the latter two. I was so in awe the whole time with how lush and beautiful this movie looks that I kept thinking about the movie long after it ended. And the CGI characters they created for this film were very natural and realistic-looking! They may not be 100% photo-realistic but they're close enough. The ""Uncanny Valley"" is nowhere to be found on the Avatars or the Na'vi. You totally believe them as real characters with real emotions and souls, and you forget that they are computer generated after a certain point in the movie. In fact, I found myself related to those CGI characters much more than the real humans. James Cameron really get it right this time! The movie's visuals (as well as the 3D) are stunning without seeming gimmicky. The story, despite being slightly predictable (which happens to most great epic films), is fast-paced and engaging throughout the movie. The theme is inspiring and thought-provoking without seeming forced and preachy. I can go on and on. There's just so many to talk about! Seeing this movie just once wouldn't be enough. I've seen it twice and I still want to see it again and I definitely will. It's weired but that's just what this movie does to you (or at least to me).To those who haven't seen this movie: Don't judge on the advertisements, previews or internet clips, none of which did the movie justice AT ALL. This is the one film you have to see and experience for yourself. And don't let the hype affect your desire of seeing this movie either. The movie is hyped for a reason, and a good one. So what are you still waiting for? Get out of your friggin' house and go see this movie already! And you'd better see it in 3D, either in IMAX or regular theaters. To truly appreciate the beauty and the awesomeness of this movie, a 3D viewing is a must!",positive
573,"This is a truly spectacular movie to look at, but it is not a spectacular movie. While you are never convinced the CG characters are ""real"" (opposed to, say, Benjamin Button), the forest and its unusual foliage is beautifully done and the sweeping shots of the alien planet are gorgeous. The 3D is largely treated well, particularly in the aforementioned fly-throughs, but there are plenty of gimmicky ""look, Ma I'm in 3d!"" shots that I thought we would be past by now - when they occur you are jolted totally out of immersion. Golf ball, I'm looking at you.That aside, the plot is totally by the book. The characters and their interactions are shallow and predictable, and bring to mind the ridiculously cliché Doom movie. The actors know it too - their performances are stilted, unbelievable and self-aware. In particular Sigourney Weaver's character is god-awful. This all lead to the impact of the major events being strictly audiovisual, not emotional. Add one of the WORST ""call to arms"" speeches I have ever seen, and a scene uncomfortably like animal rape, and I left wondering whether ""Aliens"" was as good as I remember.This stuff I guess can be ignored, not everybody needs realistic characters. What really annoyed me were the array of small but noticeable plot holes and inconsistencies. Minor, but enough of them that I became more and more annoyed as the film progressed.Go see it for the 3D scenery and sweet tech, but don't bother bringing tissues (or your cognitive abilities, for that matter).",positive
574,"It's hard to review Avatar without reviewing its fandom and its author's actions surrounding it. So I'm not going to try: I will review this movie based on the fact that people consider it to be revolutionary and powerful. Because not only has this movie turned out to be a blockbuster, it has received rave reviews as well. I expected the former and was flabbergasted by the latter.It has all the elements of a good blockbuster: spectacular visual effects, a clear black and white morality, attractive stars and fast paced action. But in my mind it completely misses any qualities that might make it a critical favorite. So why is it anyway? What am I missing? Roger Ebert claims: ""It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message."" Now some people would argue that this message is brought so over the top and corny that it ruins immersion and makes the story too ludicrously black and white. I would go a step further: this has nothing to do with actual environmentalism and pacifism. This is just pretense, symbolical politics that has nothing to do with actual issues.Enviromentalism is not about being against evil corporations, but about offering an alternative and working for that. It is not about ""going back to nature"" but about improving our current society in such a way that it becomes more sustainable. In short: worshiping hunter-gatherer societies is not environmentalism, but escapism. It is refusing to improve your own society and instead idealize another.Pacifism, similarly, is not about fighting with bows and arrows instead of tanks and helicopters. And it is also not about joining a society in which no individualism exists, in which everyone must submit to the greater goal. How is joining the other side in any way connected to anti-war? If this is really meant allegorically, should Western pacifists go to Afghanistan and start killing NATO soldiers? Of course not. Cameron doesn't make his heroes kill the soldiers as a metaphor for killing them in real life, but as a metaphor for ""making them go away"". Oh, wouldn't it be nice if there were no more imperialists? Well, sure. But stopping imperialism by non-violent means is hard and frustrating work, not glorious pwnage. Again, pure escapism. No attempt is made to reflect an actual solution to a problem, but an imaginary totalitarian solution is idealized.Cameron speaking in his imagined language at the Golden Globes was a wake-up call for me. Don't pretend this is anything more than a pipe-dream people. This movie doesn't have a message. It just has an illusionary solution that nobody would want in real life.Once that smokescreen is cleared I hope some people might see the plot for what it is: wafer-thin. We know next to nothing about most main characters, even by the end of this over 2 1/2 hour movie. Why does Jake accept losing his human body and family/friends? How did he really relate to his brother? Why does Michelle Rodriguez' character switch sides? Why are (almost?) all people working for the mining corporation American? Why does Neytiri prefer humans? How does that affect her self-image? How did a young pretender get to run the mining corporation? And why do the Na'vi accept being led by a human? I could go on... for a 3D movie the characters are spectacularly 2-dimensional. One would expect quite a few transformational scenes in a movie about physical transformation: scenes in which different characters mourn the loss of what they leave behind, or curse their dependence on what they're gaining. You know, as happens in almost every episode of say, Scrubs or Lost. It's a cheap trick, but it makes your characters sort of human. And their dilemmas real and insightful. Instead of pure distracting entertainment. If anyone involved accepted that there is no depth to this movie I guess I would give it a 6 or even a 7. As it stands, the pretense of meaning makes the distraction much worse.",neutral
575,"An ex-Marine finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people.I'm a huge fan of James Cameron. The best film ever created is TITANIC, in my opinion. I'm not afraid to admit it. It should be no surprise that I absolutely loved AVATAR after walking out of the screening room. Now, did I walk in with a certain bias toward the film? Probably, yes, I would say. However, to be fair, the film surpassed the hype which made it out to be a revolutionary film that will change the course of film making of all mankind. And I will say this now: This revolutionary film will change the course of film making of all mankind.What makes this movie so revolutionary is that it sets a standard for 3D movies, and a high one at that. It not only puts the 3D to good use, in a way it contributes to the overall story than having things pop out every five seconds, but it is also successful at integrating motion capture with live performances in a way where it blows every previous films faulty attempts away. The technology is that good. Trust me. Technically, the film should be able to win every award dealing with it because, let's be honest, Cameron knows how to tell a broad story, especially in this size and scope.But what about the story? I've been rambling about how good the technology and the effects are, considering it has a budget of around $275 million. The story is sometimes predictable and clichéd. If anything, people usually commend Cameron's ability to tell a story on screen but don't put his screen writing skills as high as a place as that and I see why people would say that. There are many films this movie borrowed from, but you know what? I don't care. Every film is, in some degree, predictable, and I believe this and the earnestness to tell and end the story in a way that has been done before is what adds to the wondrous quality of the film.When I saw Sam Worthington in TERMINATOR: SALVATION, which came out earlier this year, I didn't appreciate his performance like many people did. However, in this film, I think he did a great job as the thick-minded character. Sigourney Weaver is in a role that is actually perfect for her but I'd assume Cameron wrote the part specifically for her, but I think she's great she's in a film that is good for her because her last few roles in the past few years have been very ""eh."" Zoe Saldana, I must say, did an excellent job as Worthington's love interest. She has this magnificent talent where you believe and feel every word she speaks.Stephen Lang plays a fantastic villain role, albeit a predictable and one-dimensional one. It's a character we all love to hate. Another character like that is played by Giovanni Ribisi, playing the ""captain"" who will never understand all the bad decisions he makes. Other actors I'd like to mention in this excessive cast are Michelle Rodriguez, Joel Moore, and CCH Pounder. For a film that is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long, the film doesn't have a dull nor slow moment, probably because a story this big should have this long a running time in order to tell it. The soundtrack by James Horner is magical but by no means one of the best ever.I found the film to be not only a huge spectacle but also a film with a story that is not so white and black and with characters you believe and root for. It also deals with some relevant, moral issues. It's entertaining, spellbinding, and a magical experience in 3D. Rarely have I ever found myself so entranced by a movie. AVATAR is the best movie of this year. See the movie in 3D not because it's better or cooler but because it's necessary. See it now. Run, don't walk, to your nearest theater. This is a movie you should see before you die.",positive
576,"Usually after sitting in a theater for almost 3 hours, you're about ready to wet yourself and your aching from sitting for so long. Not at all with this movie.I sat there totally engaged in the story and characters and I wanted more when it was done.The story/plot is pretty simple and straight forward. Humans are on a planet, humans want something off the planet but the natives are in the way. It's a story that has been seen before, but this movie makes it feel fresh and fantastic.Story aside though, everyone should see it for the CG. It is absolutely breathtaking. The entire environment, the native animals, the natives. You go in not really expecting to really care for these tall blue CG creations, but you completely forget they're computer animated.Their movements, facial expressions, emotions, everything was done SO well that you forget and can just enjoy the character.Highly recommend this movie. My husband and I are thinking about seeing it in 3D :)",positive
577,"While by no means a perfect movie, it's very, very good. Great entertainment. Great characters and although a rehash of an old story, and parts of it were a bit ho-hum, it's generally creatively massaged into a new environment, although I couldn't tell if he was going for a Native American experience or an African one. Character development lagged a bit and I thought it weird how Weaver's character had such a different personality depending on whether she was in her human shoes or her Na'vi ones. As far as the acting goes, nothing real taxing here and the cast did a pretty good job. Neytiri was far and away my favorite character, Jake coming in as a close second. TBH, the only thing that turned me off were those tails. Not sure why but there had to be a better way.All in all, great entertainment and even though there was some violence, no blood and guts so OK for younger viewers. I watched it twice on two different days because it was such a ""new"" concept, I wanted to be sure I caught everything. Enjoyed it the second time as much as the first time.",positive
578,"The full movie is take your breath away! I have to admit that it's quite easy to impress me, but when i left the cinema I was just amazed. First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think.The movie really impressed me it has the best specials effects you could ever seen, and the movie was really intense, with explosions screams, cries and other things. The action takes place in 2154 on Pandora who is the theater of the shock between human beings come exploit a rare ore and the natives population, the Na' vi who live in perfect symbiosis with their environment and try to defend themselves in front of the militarized invasion. The central character of the story is Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine which, via its adversity, is going to have to choose his camp with as stake the fate of the planet.The Surrounding on ""Pandora"" doesn't let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. The emotions displayed on the characters faces were incredibly detailed, especially Neytiri. It all looked so real.... The flying scenes were incredible, and the scenes when the humans interact with the Na'Vi were flawless. It was amazing. But what I liked the most was the scrip and the story between the Navi and the human ever if I particularly love how the actors were modernize. The scene which really gave me a big thrill is the final fight. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also.It looked so real... I really wanted it to never end .This was probably the first movie that I actually was disappointed that it ended. I spend a real good time watching this movie and I think I will remember oh it for a long time. Avatar was probably the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. The special effects were jaw-dropping, and i didn't even see the movie in 3-D.",positive
579,"Welcome to my Avatar review dear fellow Cinemania's.The story begins rapidly within 5 minutes you know exactly where you are in the story. It is not told very good, but if you pay attention you learn the background. We meet Jake Sully (Jakesully) a former Marine that does not have enough money to get his paraplegia operated (yes it is possible at that time). His brother was a very important aspect in the Avatar project. It is not really explained why he died, but because they were twins he could also control his avatar apparently. He never had training, but he agrees to go along to prove to his doctors that he still can do things he did before.Let me say one thing the first time you see Pandora it will blow your mind. You meet the General red neck (yes with three scars on his face) this made me realize that I should not pay attention to the story anymore. It is just so original. The first time he is in his Avatar it is amazing, but the scenes without the Avatars are not interesting. The Forrest is beautiful with a lot of colors, strange animals etc. There we meet the local Na'vi's who for a strange reason (they casted the sky people out a time ago) see in Jake someone who could learn their manors. So he gets trained by a Na'vi girl. Well it is not a great plot twist that they get feelings for each other, but like I said before you should not watch this movie for its story, because it is not good. After training for a while he can become a true Na'vi living at the Hometree, but the general who wants to gain unobtanium which is worth a lot of dollars for his boss needs to get those Na'vi away from the Hometree, because The unobtanium's biggest source is beneath Home tree the place where the Na'vi lives.After a while they get impatient and after hearing the blog of Jack Sully where he states that the Na'vi never leave the Homtree they decide to pull the plug out the Avatar project. He starts to bomb the Hometree. Amazing plot twist was that Neytiri(the Na'vi chick) gets mad at Jake, because he betrayed them, but because he was so connected to their world and was disgusted by the way they were bombed out of their home he decided he was going to help the Na'vi.To earn back their trust he tries to capture and connect to Turok Macho the biggest bird-like creature on the planet. He had trouble with connecting and capturing the smaller bird, but the biggest bird was captured quit easily for some reason. Same as those arrows the Na'vi shoot first have no affect on the glass of the choppers, but later they penetrate right through the glass. There are more holes in the story, but I will not mention them.He and the Na'vi came up with a strategic plan to win the fight from the Sky people. He and his friend find guns (Radom guns that fit to their much bigger bodies perfectly (?)And attack. To summarize Avatar you need to state this sentence: Avatar is Beautiful, but the story lacks. The story is just to plain and the same as so many other movies out there. It only receives a 7, because the graphics are stunning.",positive
580,"This was definitely a complete masterpiece. I can not name one single flaw with the movie. It had everything from amazing visual effects, spectacular acting, a story line that keeps you interested above and beyond, wrapped up into one amazing movie. The Pandora world Cameron has produced was so pure, beautiful, and surreal. The Avatar people were amazing and even the little details were genius work. It makes you want to become an Avatar and live in this fantasy world. I really can not even put into words how in awe I was of James Cameron's work. This movie spoke to me in so many different ways. I hope that everyone has a chance to see this!",positive
581,"The creation of a brand-new, unique world in Avatar is nothing less than spectacular. Clearly the film should get Oscars for Visual Effects and Art Direction.Unfortunately, the story is dry, trite and predictable. I spent the last 45 minutes checking the time and waiting impatiently for the number-one bad guy and the number-one good guy to fight it out (with the good guy winning, of course) and for our hero to get transferred into his Na'vi body. The dialogue was flat and and the acting painfully wooden. Hundreds of millions and they can't give us better writing and acting? But the biggest disappointment for me was the plot. Once again we are told that the only answer to violence is more violence. If even the peaceful Na'vi can't find alternative responses to aggression, what hope do the rest of us have? What a golden opportunity to show a fresh, nonviolent response that could have inspired us all to find peaceful solutions in our own life. Of course, that wouldn't have appealed to the 12-year-old boys who have hijacked Hollywood films. Violence and big-budget battle scenes have become essential – money rules. We have become inured to violence in our world and see it as the only possible answer. But as Gandhi wrote, ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Shouldn't film directors and writers take every opportunity to inspire as well as entertain? Even films made ""just to entertain"" inevitably instruct by the examples shown by their plot choices. So (yawn) once again we learn that the only response to violence is more violence. That we have myriad examples of this kind of response in life is no excuse. Peaceful solutions can only come about when we believe they are possible.",neutral
582,"The last time I thought a movie deserved a 10 star rating was "" The Color Purple ""; unfortunately we've had a plethora of bad to mediocre movies that have been made recently. Avatar takes the spotlight for excellence, innovation, creativity, character design and a legion of other qualities. The thing I noticed most about Avatar is the beautiful graphics the attention to detail; I also noticed with sheer awe is how well the actors and actresses acted out their part. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana were absolutely spellbinding in their roles; Zoe Saldana made me look at her acting ability in a different light with her playing Neytiri. She played a very compassionate, and mundane role in the movie so well that she should be awarded an Oscar along with Sam Worthington. Everyone played out their part awesomely; Avatar is easily one of the best movies made in the history of cinema. James Cameron is an absolute genius at work people; I look forward to similar quality movies made by this man.",positive
583,"One hallmark of a poor movie is that the experience significantly degrades upon repeated viewings. For all the spectacular CGI, incredible scenery, and highly imaginative landscaping, the movie bores repeatedly with one movie cliché after another. Do I need to count what was stolen from The Matrix, Alien/Aliens, Dances with Wolves? Why rely on what has become known plot twists and conventions? How could Cameron recycle so many overused ideas in one movie? Sure the concept had much potential -- but with the focus on the FX, the more subtle plot details get washed out in predictability. Of course, the movie looks spectacular, especially in 3D on IMAX. The movie could have been so much more...",neutral
584,"I walked in to this movie to have a good time, i heard about the superb visuals and great story so i thought well so many people cant be wrong. Even though i am well aware that movies heavy on CGI can be huge disappointments. I walked in with an open mind and having seen a lot of movies in my time i was ready to se what the fuss was about this one. The trailer or the movie pretty much gave away the ending, i knew from the get go that there will be a huge conflict between humans and Navi.As the movie entered the stage where Jake meets the pretty Navi chief daughter i knew where this movie was going....... Dances with wolves in space. Thing is Jake is from the start coming of as someone who really has no intention of serving any cause.....it would be far more interested if Jake was this hardened marine that has a change of heart and truly undergoes a transformation of personality....that is not the case here.The film is amazing in 3D but the characters are stuck in 1 dimension. The evil General was your stereotypical villain only out for blood and no mercy.Navis are your typical native population who se their lands destroyed and taken advantage of.The corporate evil guy is also very typical. Compare that to the corporate guy in Aliens whos true agenda we at first did not really se through......because of a good script. But in this movie the guy is directly portrayed as this money hungry greedy asshole.I knew what was coming and i was not surprised by anything the story threw at me, i felt rather unmotivated to sit through, the only motivation to do so was the pretty graphics.Even here, i will always be amazed by true stunt choreography, jackie chan and anything made realistically with real people than a bunch of computer programmers creating explosions and graphics behind their desks.You might think i hated the movie, no it was OK and a fun ride, easy to follow and enjoyable. But deep and surprising? Nah.....",negative
585,"Just a quick preface and caveat before continuing. I am NOT giving this a rating of ten for great story, script writing or acting (farrrrrr from it). I'm simply giving Avatar a ten for no other reason than it will be remembered as the 3D film that launched a new era in cinematography and movie making. That's it. Too much carping from the Cannes Film Festival crowd about it being crap because of it's shallow storyline (wading pool shallow, actually) and being a rehash of a classic theme (which it is). Really guys......do you go to a Spielberg or Cameron movie for depth? Even their attempts at serious stuff turns predictably melodramatic and overripe regardless how naturally serious the original material might be (Titanic, Shindler's list, Munich......etc.). For goodness sake, don't go to see these guys' work for anything more than sheer FANTASTIC (not to be believed, literally and figuratively) entertainment and an affective purge (have a good cry and heart thump).Now to business. The plot line is blatantly simplistic, yet classic: foreigner meets primitives, ulterior motives, love affair with chief's daughter (sleeping dictionary / Dances with Wolves themes), then betrayal, epiphany, motives change to altruistic, rescue of primitives, becomes one with the primitives.....you know the drill. Any other movie and that would be the ""mother of all spoilers"", but for this eye candy of a presentation the story is almost irrelevant.However, despite the predictable plot and storyline, this visual banquet has to be seen to be believed. I don't think I'll be able to watch a TV or DVD / Blue ray rerun without 3D enhancement technology. I guess that's the whole point: get us hooked on this stuff (no comparison to flat lander cinema for action movies) and then bring on the 3D TVs / Blue Rays / AV / etc. Lastly, 3D may inevitably be prerequisite for superior action and sci fi cinema, as well as sports, but it will NEVER replace or usurp the fundamentals of good movie making and acting. Personally, I don't want to see ANY of the classics remade in 3D (I didn't even like colorization......more like ""bastardization""). 3D is just a cool tool; that's all. So you puritans out there......just relax! See a good proctologist, lay down, roll over and say AHHHH! He'll have that CFF corn cob out of there in no time. Then you can enjoy life again. P.S. that last bit with the hanging O2 mask and last grasp / gasp scene was just way too ""Spielberg"" for this kid. That kind of stuff doesn't make my heart pound, it makes my blood boil.",positive

Hats-0ff to them...It speaks of the connection of oneself to every living thing outside. Its very concept has been beautifully designed and pictured.I have been watching this movie and all of a sudden, I was into the movie. It looked very real and I was completely involved. I even thought that such a 'pandora' world actually existed for sometime. Only at the end of the movie, I have to realize that its a 'movie'. Hope such a outer world really exists, we never knew. :) Seeing the publicity for the movie, I had the feeling that there is much unnecessary hype being created.

In the end all i have to say is, no matter if u are a guy or a girl, I assure u that u will be amazed!My final words: If u don't see Avatar in a cinema, Let me tell u, U have missed out on the experience of a lifetime!",positive

I was quite skeptical going in - I saw the early reviews here on IMDb, and was wondering if much of the hype could be coming from paid marketing shills.But, that is not the case. Its just a fantastic movie.I'm pretty jaded - I usually don't feel very satisfied with most movies. But this one was different. It felt like it lasted an eternity - but in a good way. It was as if you were there with Jake for the whole three months he spent with the Na'vi.By the way, the IMAX 3D was expensive, but it was worth it in this case if only for the sound and the high quality screen. I'm now curious how it looks in 2D.Don't miss this one.",positive
589,"James Cameron's Avatar is an endeavor of titanic proportions, no pun intended. It took upwards of 12 years and a budget larger than that of some third world nations to come to fruition. So... Was it worth it? Well, first of all, the script is lackluster. The plot is standard and predictable, the characters are cookie-cutter at best, overblown caricatures at worst. With a none-too-subtle message about the evils of technology encroaching on the natural balance.This was the part of the movie that didn't sit well with me. I'm the first to admit that the human race is full of arrogant jerks, but I'd like to think we've progressed as a species to the point where we wouldn't be willing and in fact blatantly eager to drive an indigenous people to extinction for our own financial gain. Maybe I'm wrong...But the message of this film seems to be, ""People are stubborn, greedy, ignorant, and violent creatures."" That constant message bothered me a lot, as did the characters who reinforced it. They're not just stupid humans. They're not just evil humans. Their adamantly uncaring and violent attitudes are physically abrasive. And there's few things I hate more than abrasive characters. I know enough irritating people in real life, without having to pay to see more.And then we have characters like Colonel Quaritch, who's not only evil and abrasively irritating, but almost totally devoid of motivation. Like Richard III, he is determined to prove a villain, and continues to be ruthlessly, sadistically antagonistic without any real reason, or at least not a good one. Unlike Richard III, he's not at all fun to watch. He's not so much a character as a personification of the Evil, Technology-Wielding Humans that the film seeks to vilify.On the other hand... The story may be lacking, the characters may be irritating, but the visual effects are stunning. The animators manage to create flora, fauna, and general topography for a completely alien world. The colors are vibrant, the details are exquisite. It's a unique and fascinating experience, incredible to look at.But then again, so was the movie Hero. And that one had a terrific script too.",neutral
590,"I'll admit that I was expecting a lot from this movie. I had heard about the huge budget and effort required to create it and had heard that it was a landmark movie that was going to take the movie business to a new level. I didn't like the movie at all. It was a trite straightforward drama with colorless characters, recycled elements, WOW factors we've seen before and a weak ""showdown"" climax.Ground breaking CGI: Big deal. I don't know about 10 year old kids, but I've seen so much CGI, for so long, that it's simply boring. Yes the glowing flowers and such were beautiful (even if the dandelion seeds were overused), but so what? Movies are best about things in our real world, like courage, loyalty and friendship. Glowing flowers are nice but can't carry a movie.Too many recycled elements from Aliens, Terminator, Star Wars, and Transformers: Weaver, cybersleep, the loaders, the veloci-copters, the gunship, the flight deck, the pilot, the sarge, the combat drop, the walkers (Star Wars). Even the guy that can't walk now being able to walk is from ""Lost."" Trite, straightforward and pretty ham-handed drama of the military guy against the ethical soldier against the scientists against the natives...Universal Soldier (Van Damme), Soldier (Kurt Russell).Avatar concept is old, and even more so now that that concept is recycled into the virtual reality gimmick: Sargon controlling Kirk, Kirk exchanging minds with that crazy lady that wanted to be Captain, Spock's Brain (where his body was controlled by a remote control), The Matrix.Weaver's character was a waste - she did not play a big part in the story and the part that she did play was sketchy. Weaver had been there how many years? Teaching them English? And she's still there leading the team even though the military is there moving? And the natives still accept her? Weaver is all hostile to the new guy right up until she puts him in the mind link chamber. Then they meet up on the other side and she's all smiles and charm towards him. Huh? The climactic battle was a lot like the Ewoks against the Empire in ""Return of the Jedi,"" right down to the grenades in the engines.The big revelation in the movie of the neural network of the trees fell totally flat. That was supposed to be a big dramatic moment but I think everyone in the audience, just like those on the command deck were like: ""So what? Is that supposed to mean something?"" There were only a few lines in the movie that supported that plot line and after the big revelation it was pretty much dropped.Characters were not colorful and well differentiated like in Aliens (All the characters were colorless: The wheelchair guy, his buddy, Weaver, the traitorous pilot, the native mother and father had extremely small parts, the native prince was colorless, even the princess was pretty colorless, the pencil pusher heartless bureaucrat, the Colonel was the only character that was almost good), there was no sparkling dialog like all throughout Aliens.It seems that some of the ""Wow factor"" of the movie was contained in the computer displays in the lab, especially the ones that could be swiped off the wall and onto a tablet PC. If they thought that would impress me....oh please. Spielberg already tried all that exact same stuff in ""Minority Report"" to equally unimpressive results and Cameron, of all people, should know that no matter how impressive your production is, it's useless without a great drama with all of the elements needed to make drama great.",neutral

So I wasn't expecting something nearly awesome. This was. People say the story is weak. It isn't. People say it is derivative - ALL movies are derivative, even Terminator, even Aliens and even Titanic - this movie has plenty which separates it. And the characters have depth even if you sometimes have to read between the lines to see it. Aside from those talking points, the f/x, action sequences, epic scale, and raw fun are all magnificent. And I haven't used the word magnificent in years and I'm pretty sure my use of it was related to 'The Magnificent Seven'. The movie is as entertaining as I can imagine a movie to be.",positive

I admit it was interesting in every way, sitting there in the cinema and enjoying those artificial landscapes. But about the storyline and characters I was completely disappointed. The movie was full of stereotypes: ""the bad stupid army guy"", ""the scientist who only cares about preserving and research"", etc. The storyline isn't new, it's just copied after other old movies. And after the final battle, after the aliens won and send the remaining humans back to Earth, the movie let's you the impression that everything is heading for everlasting peace. I considered that stupid since planet Earth was ""dieing"" (which also annoyed me cause they didn't say why or at what is that mineral good for). Humans will return and the main character must know that pretty well, so why everything seems like ""and they lived happily ever after""? .And by the way, the humans with all that advanced technology, couldn't just send a nuke from that base or from orbit at the coordinates of that ""Life Tree"" ? Or if not a nuke, then a remote controlled rocket or something. This technology is available in our days, but somehow it seems that it isn't 140 years in the future or so.

There are very few directors who master the art of movie-making not because they know it, but because they want to make something different every time and excel in their field. James Cameron is one of them. When he made terminator it was ahead of time, same was the case with Abyss or Aliens and Titanic. And now its Avatar. Some viewers did not like the movie mainly because they went with too much expectations about the story and performance. This movie is not about the story, its not about the actors, its neither about performances but its about taking your viewers to different world, its about making them see something they have never seen before. When you watch it again you will realize that such movies can never be made again. The CGI created on screen is so advanced and complete that you enter a different world altogether and leave the theater spellbound. And watch it on 3D as such movies are made for 3D. Mark my words 30 years from now people will realize that Avatar was a masterpiece and James Cameron the greatest movie-maker of 21st century.",positive

Makes the actions of the miners more understandable if not sympathetic. Prior to that, I got the impression it was just about profits.B. At the end he spits on the defeated miners and says ""Go back to your dying world"". Presumably to DIE. Nice James. Thanks.How hard would have it been for him to say ""Go back to the stars and learn from this....learn that your salvation is not best earned by the destruction of others"".Instead he basically puts a curse on the human race. Hmmmm, he goes on and on about ""traitors to your race"". Maybe James, philosophically speaking is a traitor to his....having given up all hope for it.I don't know what he wants to see us replace by....whales?

595,"Mr. Cameron as much as I appreciate the amazing special effects and gorgeous animation as well as the detail you put into creating a new world with species, I can't help but think I have seen this exact same movie before. I must say I am also a big fan of Ferngully just like you (assumed lol), but you should really consider on coming up with your own original story, granted it was a great concept. Besides making this movie is probably just an excuse to throw other people under the bus (military.) I mean ptsh, it's not like they are putting their lives on the line defending our country or anything, right? Way to go on making a film with so much potential turn political. Maybe a sequel should help, let's make them fly and have the ability to surf! As a matter of fact, you should title it ""Large Flying Surfing Smurfs Protectors of Mystic Fairy Land and Star Wars Creatures Part Two!"" Phew, sorry about that, I am getting off topic, in all honesty this movie kind of sucked. And just out of the goodness of my heart you earn a golden star, hats off to you sir.",negative
596,"I am in awe of this movie's sumptuous feast of colour and imagery! The storyline of the characters are predictable, I don't mind though. The CGI and 3D make up for anything else that you might want to 'whinge' or complain about.My son is 17 and unfortunately did not see this in 3D which affected his review. He said it was so-so on the storyline. He usually loves this kind of movie, so I was surprised. Meanwhile, he will be sent back to see it again with his big brother and change his review! The 3D version has gorgeous and believable depth, you'll see all plant life, creations & machinery you haven't seen in a movie before,too. All in sharp 3D. It's done in the way that it isn't cheesy and corny. (Remember Jaws & Friday 13 in 3D? ugh). The vegetation, animals & material things are jutting out suddenly or floating around subtly. You do feel like you are part of the movie, nicely done I think. After awhile, you are aware of the little pieces of this and that around in 3D and ooh and ah at it quietly, really. (We could hear ourselves and people around us, respectively doing this.No one was disruptive or acting like idiots in the audience, not one peep! I think everyone was humbled to experience this incredible CGI creativity. I was sad ;o) when it reverted back to human form throughout, I just wanted to see the CGI all the time! No Jar Jar Binks & Gollum in this movie. 100 times better than that, too.I love futuristic movies, this one is up there with the best. Yes the US marines are stereotyped in this movie, oh well, too bad. They serve a purpose. There are environmental, corporate, moral, ethical and tolerance messages throughout this movie.This is a keeper and I believe one of the best, visually stunning movies ever made. How James Cameron made his people steam train forward with his vision is incredible. I look forward to many more movies made like this one, not necessarily alien / futuristic. This will surely bring people back to the good old cinema.This should / must win all the awards for art direction, editing. I wonder how pain staking some of this was to make? I love Star Wars & Lord of the Rings, but this movie tops both of them for the breakthrough imagery on screen. So enjoyable. I think we will see it again maybe at the Sydney IMAX.Do not dare to cheap out and download this, people!!! You will not regret seeing it - on the bigger screen the better!! On another note, I can't believe our local little town cinema did not install the Dolby 3D equipment (they said would cost $200k). If not now, but also for the future of movies going forward. The lady at the cinema told me, ""oh, there are only a few scenes with 3D"" BullS@#&%!!!! We went in town and saw it in 3D, thankfully.So summarizing, ahh... $16 AUD well spent, I'd spend another.. will the eventual DVD come with those 3D glasses? I hope so!! Go see it before you are the last one and everyone has finished talking to death about it, will ya? Cheers to James Cameron. I give it a 300 million (cost to make it) thumbs up!!!",positive
597,"James Cameron is a force of nature. His movies have an all-encompassing, ambient power of their own. The kind of power that makes a James Cameron movie a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar is his biggest yet. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a visionary masterwork of classic epic filmmaking and cutting-edge technology.Avatar's ambitious story follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) as he travels to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora's native humanoids, the Na'vi. The leader of the program, Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the greedy CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) look to exploit the Na'vi for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.Jake's inner conflict drives Avatar's story, and structurally, it works. Yes, it borrows a lot from Dances with Wolves. Learning from and becoming part of another culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. As a paraplegic, Sully's avatar allows him freedom. It gives him a genuine reason to view Na'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. I can buy it. And once the two sides of him finally clash, the power of that conflict really hits. It's a tangibly large story. Epic and engrossing. The effectiveness of that simple story, well told, of connecting with your supposed enemies is why I resent the disingenuous love story Cameron decided to put front and center.Before I get to the lavish praise of Avatar, which I consider one of the most special movie experiences of the century, I must address my one nagging grievance. The love story, the Neytiri character, and all the preachy ""bio-spiritual"" fluff that comes with her, irked me. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn't change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, and the CEO practices golf in his office. The point is, these are bold-faced archetypes. Neytiri is no different. She's a tree-hugging, flower-power philosopher. That's fine, but Zoe Saldana's performance has none of Stephen Lang's towering vitality or Weaver's cool confidence. It's all screeching and posturing. She's shrill and angry, and her spirituality quickly devolves into a full-on castigation of the evils of military conquest and deforestation. Shouldn't this spiritual guide be a little more even-keeled? I never believed that Jake would fall for her. Compared to Cameron's other movie romance, Titanic, Avatar seems manufactured. Neytiri is less a character than she is a face on which to pin the movie's heavy-handed message.With that out of the way, let's get to what makes Avatar the single most monumental cinematic achievement of this generation. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what's really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron's attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.So too are his technical innovations. The movie is remembered most for it's pioneering use of 3D, and rightfully so. Implemented alongside the uncanny photo-realism of the Na'vi's, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants, the 3D is more transporting than anything I have ever seen. All the superlatives in the world can't completely do justice to the Weta team that brought Cameron's gargantuan vision to reality, so I won't bother. The truly commendable aspect of Avatar is not that the special effects are so sophisticated, but that you forget that what you are watching are indeed special effects. Avatar uses 3D to immerse rather than amuse. You are absorbed in the world of Pandora so completely, that it cuts across the divide we have with most films. You don't watch Avatar, you live it, feel it, experience it.That feeling of absolute immersion is what defines Avatar. It's a movie, with plot, characters, and a story, but that stuff doesn't matter as much as the physical sensation it creates of actually being in a brand-new world. It's true, Jake Sully is less important than Pandora. But those who dismiss Avatar as simply ""pretty pictures"" are undervaluing the impact of James Cameron's image-making. Avatar creates visuals and utilizes technology so well, it makes the audience feel like part of the film. Some people take for granted just how significant that is. Others take for granted James Cameron's direction. Here is the single most ambitious movie ever conceived, and Cameron handles it all with the confidence of a world-class chef. This guy is not intimidated by anything. He is an elite director; the world's leader in action and world-building, and miraculously, he keeps getting better! Avatar is his most accomplished film.Avatar's success lies in its ability to engross every kind of moviegoer. Science fiction geeks and action aficionados can revel in some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), sentimental romantics can connect to the classic story, and even those who don't connect to either can experience the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of visiting Pandora. James Cameron has made a picture that defies comparison. There is not another movie that reverberates with the ethereal power of Avatar. Because Avatar is beyond movies. The film is overwhelming; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I've seen. Assisted by James Horner's majestic score and Mauro Fiore's epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. An original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. This is truly Cameron's magnum opus, a movie that burns with boundless passion. A classic that thrills as it inspires awe.93/100",positive
598,"The animation work was simply spectacular. A lot of love, care and detail went into the creation of the Na'vi and the environment of Pandora. One of the characters in Avatar, Neytiri stood out a mile and you'd be forgiven if you shed a tear in some of the scenes she's in.If you can look passed the futuristic nature and actually feel the moral of the story, you will appreciate the message being said. That is what I found most interesting about the movie; the historical nature of the human race.This could be a wake up call for humanity and maybe that was James Camerons ambition? It is certainly better to make your own decision but I would thoroughly recommend watching Avatar yourself on big screen. Do not wait for it to come out on video unless of course you have a 90inch TV.An amazing movie. Thank you James Cameron and everyone else involved in the production of Avatar.",positive
599,"After going off the face of the earth for over twelve years, James Cameron, one of the great directors of our time, has risen from the ashes victoriously. The CGI is magnificent, and is no doubt the best I've ever seen since Peter Jackson blew the world's mind with his ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"". The motion capture on the actors' bodies looks so real, that it took me to another dimension, almost another world. This grandeur was not only captured through the character animation, but also with the different CGI location shots of the different creatures, the forest, the trees, and the whole world he has created. This world reminded me very much of the 1992 release of ""Ferngully"", but in 3-D. Now regarding the plot, it is James Cameron simplicity-a paraplegic soldier (Sam Worthington) is given the opportunity to take in part of a mission on the planet Pandora. There, he learns that a greedy corporation intends to drive out the planet's inhabitants, the Na'vi, so to retrieve millions of dollars worth of minerals. In exchange for a spinal surgery that'll fix his legs, he gathers information for a military unit, led by a bloodthirsty Colonel (Stephen Lang) while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an ""avatar"" identity. As time passes and tension increases between the Na'vi and the humans, he is drawn between his orders and what he desires. The plot sounds simple enough, yet I can't help but notice all of the undertones that James Cameron throws into his film. Without giving too much more of the story away, it made me think of how the U.S. government bullies people into what they want, particularly with the Iraq War, which is a fight over oil, at the cost of innocent Iraqi lives. I don't know if this was Cameron's intent, but this movie gives a pale reflection of our modern government and big corporations. It also reflects on our issue with planet life. Cameron paints the marines as bloodthirsty villains who lust for destruction, but the Na'vi on the other hand, are deep lovers of nature and peace. This reminds me very much of the cowboy and Indian scenario depicted graphically in films such as ""Little Big Man"" and ""Dances with Wolves"", the white man's inability to make peace with both nature and different races. The Na'vi themselves remind me much of the Native Americans, despite the fact they're blue with pointy ears, and with golden eyes.Overall, there is much to look forward to in ""Avatar"", and not just in the visual effects department. The actors all did a great job but I don't expect any of them to be nominated for an Oscar. On a personal note though, Stephen Lang as the gung-ho Colonel and Sigourney Weaver as the peace loving Scientist gave the best performances, and not because both are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, but with the fact they immersed themselves deeply into their characters so magically. And for a 162-minute film, it flies by. There's no way you can be bored with this movie. James Cameron has once again made another excellent film that I'll declare as 2009's best film, and I'm considering in adding ""Avatar"" on my personal favorite list of movies. This movie has everything, effects (both visually and emotionally), believable characters, an interesting plot, and a fast pace. And trust me, at the end of the movie, you'll be cheering for the Na'vi.",positive
600,"Not about air-bending...A new, technological re-make of ... Fern Gully. I mean does everyone not see this? I'll see the movie for the effects, but the story is OLD, and it is getting older since nothing changes in these movies. Male is 'seduced' by a 'local' girl to support her side. blah blah blah.I would much rather had no local interaction and the 'intruder' realize, on his own, that what they were doing is wrong. Why does it take someone else to make us realize we should stop doing something? This 'teaches' the young to not think for themselves... He could have had a 'relampago' moment of realization that what they were doing is wrong--perhaps in discussions with others on his 'team.' The movie could have been about how he struggled within the system while helping the 'locals.' I think that would have been a better movie.Talk to your kids about critical thought and why they should think for themselves rather than just 'accept.'",neutral
601,"Avatar is one of the most amazing looking films I have ever seen. The story however, sucks (as does the music).THE GOOD - Great 3D, best use of it I've seen. No gimmicks like sticking things out at the audience which snaps you right out of the film. Here it was just depth and exhilarating.As I watched the visual effects in Avatar all I could feel was a sense of awe and also a sense of sadness. I felt sad for any other film that might have been up for any forthcoming visual effect nominations. Avatar will take them all. Some scenes felt truly magical. Like the first time jake and Neytiri fly together. I was totally engaged.The BADThe script was bad. We have seen this story countless times. The storytelling wasn't great either. It would have been great to see the state earth has become - would have made Pandora seem all the more virginic. It would have been great to have some character development. To illustrate Jakes change a bit better. To shade the two dimensional bad guy a bit more...The music. The music was lazy and unimaginative. James Horner phoned this one in and Avatar could of had a unique sound - like the way LOTR has - but instead sounds like every other blockbuster. This is a shame.All in all. A visual feast for the eyes but nothing more.",neutral
602,"Avatar gets a 10 because of its visuals and some of the natural soul satisfying themes therein. The rest of the film does not matter; I'll explain why.The plot is as standard and as conventional as they come. The whole film is a collective of clichés and things we have all seen before on screen. A Marine without the use of his legs becomes part of a program on Pandora. Selected individuals become the 'avatars' that have been specifically engineered for them and go out into the alien world of Pandora. The objective: to study the natives, indigenous 'beasts,' life forms and layout of terrain in the interests of military tactical advantage. The Marine is given the incentive of government-approved working legs if he is successful in completing the objective. Marine, assisted by ever so cheesy, clichéd, cartoonish two-dimensional characters enters world, meets girl, meets tribe, learns ways, gets accepted, falls in love, and ultimately decides in all predictability that Pandora is more valuable to him than the 'real' world. That's about ten or so films that we can all list covered so far. And so 'jarhead' ultimately becomes protagonist, protector and defender when the 'good' guys who are fighting the 'savages' decide it's time to eradicate and show them just who is boss. Don't you love the mentality :) So, back to the reason of sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses. It takes a little while, but the reason for every Effects house, department, and agency working on a 400-million dollar film becomes oh so very apparent. So I am a gamer, very much accustomed to playing pretty games on high-end tech. I am also a film geek, details, details, details. So, you will understand that when the lights go down a little and I'm looking at 'other worldly' vegetation full of sap or rain water, and I sit there shaking my head because my brain can't seem to compute that specially created/generated foliage defies that very concept. When the lights go down on Pandora I might as well be looking out of my own window. Indeed, I was also dubious when I heard a similar statement. Avatar, when you get past - but can't really get past - because you are looking at animation that looks so real that you can instantly (pretty much) tell who the actor is behind the 'mask' - the phenomenal visuals. You are allowed to smile, and perhaps to have your eyes well up a little, with Jake's first encounter as a 'Dragon' rider. Here perhaps is a nod to Anne McCaffrey's 'Pern.' The rider chooses the Dragon and the Dragon the rider. When the bond is made, they become one. I want to get back to the characters again. Remember when I said details, details, details: The skin, the eyes, the flakes of dust that land on the skin after an explosion, the ears that move and stretch. the physical motions and motor skills. What is the expression I am looking for.. 'more human than human'. OK, time to close. The weakest link, in my opinion, and I truly hate to say this out of my respect for one of the mothers of sci-fi, is Sigourney Weaver's character. Rather than playing a secure, natural maternal scientist we have a re-hashed Ripley after 23 years, only it only serves to weaken the experience. As soon as Sigourney opens her mouth, I want her to close it. It's not big, it's not clever; and I don't care if it's a military 'thing' in a PG-13 film. The mild swearing is out of place. Some of the audience cheered and clapped when Michelle (signature frown and growl) Rodriguez says: ""You're not the only one with a gun, bitch!"" Why do women need to grow balls in these flicks.. You don't need to compete with the alpha male who is doing a fine job of cheapening the human race. It sounds great coming from Sigourney Weaver, in full control of a robot walker facing off against mother Alien, but it's not 'Aliens', it's Rodriguez with a pair who should stay in films that go straight to video shelf. I perceive that there is a reason behind the far too obviously staged overacting. It contrasts with the wonderful soothing, soul enriching acting from the Naa'ri. It also serves to exploit the human race for what they are: Takers, antagonists, butchers, and barbarians. Avatar is the current apotheosis of the reason we enjoy cinema. Anyone who is anyone can enjoy it, though preferably not younger children. Kids and adults alike who don't understand (or care about) the plot can get lost in the amazing world of Pandora.Highly recommended, not something that should be missed on the biggest, most technically capable theater you can find. Can't be described, needs to be seen to be believed.",positive
603,"After his previous, ground-breaking feature 'Titanic' (1997) director James Cameron has returned to playing things safe and by the rules.'Avatar' is a nice pastime, though it will not amaze you. Its premise is very familiar, and it takes the audience nowhere new, but still to places they like. It also seems to enjoy monkeying about with huge issues, concepts and themes, such as genocide and religion, though there is nothing depicted here that we haven't seen done before, and done better.Even its visuals – which are supposed to be the film's crowning glory – are immensely overrated, and however splendid they may be, they have been outdone time and again by the greats (Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Robert Zemeckis, Baz Lhurmann, Steven Spielberg, Jim Henson...). After all, when has CGI ever stood a chance against puppetry and stop-motion animation? A dimension is added by the stunning 3D, but a dimension is taken away by the paper-thin, unsustainable plot.Nevertheless, it still manages to be entertaining and frequently rather affecting, but it's excruciatingly slow-moving for an action film and surprisingly ordinary for the highest-grossing film in cinema history.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang try their hardest not be outdone by colourful trees, unintentionally hilarious digital monsters and blue-skinned, elf-like Aborigines.",neutral
604,"At one point in Avatar the military unit on Pandora throws gas canisters into the home of the Na'vi. A shot shows one of these gas canisters hitting the ground and rebounding; sitting in the theatre with my 3D glasses on I flinched. 3D is cool.Approximately fifteen years after originally conceived, Avatar is finally in theatres and it is, amazing. The story centres on Jake Sully and his experiences on a planet called Pandora that humans have recently discovered. On Pandora there are all kinds of new life including the Na'vi, a race similar to humans except overall just better. Due to really really cool technology Jake controls an avatar (a body that looks just like a Na'vi) and can see, hear and feel through his avatar all from the comfort of the lab. Soon he (as in his avatar) is living with the real Na'vi, learning their ways, falling in love and eventually protecting them against the greedy, capitalistic humans. This story is complicated but James Cameron has almost three hours for it to develop and the plot never feels rushed.The story alone is interesting enough to make this movie worthwhile but it is the visuals that set this movie apart. A whole new world has been created with this movie. Pandora looks like Discovery Channel's Holy Grail; every minute detail is incredible, from the Na'vi to the plants in the background of some unimportant scene. The hours logged to make this movie must be astronomical. Even the technology of the humans is cool and least remotely realistic. Giant planes and helicopters, impressive iron man-robot-type-deals, hell the breathing masks are cool.And then there's the 3D. Avatar is considered the first 3D movie directed at adults; translation being: this movie will make or break the future of 3D. Luckily it's made it. Besides the whole ""look-something's popping out of the screen"" gimmick 3D is amazing because it makes everything look ultra-high-definition. Scenes are given layers and the audience is brought that much closer into the film. This movie has shown that even romantic comedies could have 3D in the future; maybe James Cameron is king of the world.What this movie needs now is a prequel. How did humans discover/locate /get-to/land-on /settle/learn-the-language /set-up-a-school/create-avatars /discover-that-expensive-mineral /develop-the-technology /etc./etc./etc.? And what about on earth, are there avatars there, are wars being fought with casualties that aren't real? What do people think of Pandora, how are the international politics playing out? If it takes six years to get to Pandora but you don't age during that time, that's got to create some weird things; a mother could end up six years older than her child. Avatar ignores a lot of questions that could fit into a whole other movie.Avatar is the future of film, there is no doubt in my mind that more and more action movies will begin to be made in 3D, with other genres soon to follow. James Cameron has created an epic movie, that movie-goers will swarm to and that will inspire the film industry and its future direction. And it only took fifteen years and three hundred million dollars.",positive
605,"Although the originality is lacking not to mention it sounds a LOT like Pochahauntaus it still is an awesome movie. The Jaw Dropping 3D is amazing though some parts were kind of boring. Unlike Titanic the story is fast paced and gets to the action. As said before it's very unoriginal. You got environmental overtones "" The Big Bad Military"" and a lot of clichés. If it wasn't for the special effects I would of walked out on this movie. If you plan to go on the movies see this now. I'm pretty sure it won't be the same on DVD. People have also said that there are a lot of Hebrew speaking but I thought that was bogus. Overall I give it a 8/10 losing points for unoriginality.",positive
606,"I went to this movie when it was out in theaters after hearing how ""amazing"" and ""compelling"" it allegedly was. Normally I like any movie, but 20 minutes in I felt my back side starting to fall asleep. This only happens when my ... is trying to worn me to get out of the theater as fast as possible. I kept wishing that this movie would turn out to be good, but then I soon realized how predictable it really was. I figured out what would happen within the first hour. I couldn't even sit through this movie again even if I was getting paid to do it. Blue cat people? Really? They connect to things with their hair? What kind of stuff was this director smoking and how do I get it, because this was pure crap wrapped up in some pretty wrapping paper with a nice bow that smelled like bile. How come, half way through we hear nothing of this rare rock crap that the government is hunting for? They discard a lot of things in this movie pretty quick and then it becomes some dramatic romance between some crippled guy and a blue cat lady. I still wish I could get my money back and I didn't pay to get into this movie. Thanks a lot Avatar for killing some of my brain cells and stealing precious hours of my life that I will never get back. Don't watch this. Don't even rent it. Don't even look up pictures of it on the internet. I swear, your IQ will drop.",negative
607,"Saw this in 3D Imax and highly recommend it in this medium. I am sure it is also outstanding in the standard format but the visuals ARE the movie and if you have a 3D screen within driving distance, definitely take advantage and go see it.The plot itself is somewhat generic. It's the stereotypical military / industrial complex (i.e. – The USA) exploiting the natural resources of indigenous peoples (i.e. – Iraq) with ruthless and inhuman efficiency. The protagonist is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who is an Army soldier who is transformed into one of the indigenous natives in order to better exploit them (ie. – steal their oil, or ""unobtainium"" in the film). The natives are 9 feet tall blue people who can communicate with other organic beings in their universe through their hair. If this sounds dumb, it is. But the visuals are stunning and well worth putting up with the D grade movie plot.I don't have much else to say about his movie. Dumb plot and insipid dialog, but breathtaking technical wizardry making this an incredible experience.",positive
608,"This is the first movie I remember feeling like I felt after reading a good sci-fi fantasy book; I didn't want it to end and was sad it was over. A good book does that, but I've never had a movie do that for me, and I've seen a good deal of movies...As the saying goes, there are only 9 plots in existence, so I am not upset by any overlaps with other movies I've watched in the past that have similar plot elements. I did find myself caring about the main characters, and while the similarities to native American movies (as mentioned in other posts, Dances with Wolves) is not surprising considering the type of characters in the movie and the motivations of the foreign invaders, the sci-fi element of a neurally connected planet was an intriguing plot element.As in all sci-fi, you need to put your present-life science knowledge in your back pocket, and assume Clarke's Three Laws of Prediction:1) When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.2) The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.3) Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.I liked this better than Star Wars, and I grew up watching those movies when they came out. But perhaps that is because nothing as involving as the original trilogy has been released since they first came out! I loved the Lord of the Rings, but it didn't make me feel this way when all was said and done...",positive
609,"This is not just another 'I LOVED AVATAR' comment but here I go:Avatar is a beautiful and awesome film. The aesthetics are insane, out of this world designs and environments. James Cameron did all his homework, the movie shows some serious screenplay and superb acting in both animated and human characters.The message is not unique but it gets to you, at some points you wished you were in Pandora, you wished you could change things, you wished it wasn't true. There is definitely more in that film than just an amazing imaginary world with a beautiful breath taking environment and polished designs.I honestly loved this film, it has everything I wanted to see: a mature and original script, good acting, a message to take with me when I left the cinema and impressive action and computer animated scenes. At some points all the 3D animations look real, the special effects are something you've never seen before. Guaranteed.The acting is brilliant, not only by Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver but also Stephen Lang who did an excellent work as the 'bad guy'. So much enthusiasm with the animated characters too, they almost looked real.Take my advice, watch this film and enjoy 'kinda long film' but it's sure worth it!10 stars for a brilliant adventure!",positive
610,"I didn't expect too much about this movie, simply because i really hate the previous film made by James Cameron (you know which one), but then i remembered what i felt when i watch The Abyss and Terminator 2; so i said ""why not?"". And you know what? I spend the most entertaining 150 minutes in a long time; WHY?, Just because James Cameron made a cinematic masterpiece and created a world that breathes and shine with its own sun. It simply blew me away. Avatar it's a film so full of details, colors and life that just watching the gorgeous and magnificent landscapes is worth the money that you pay for your ticket. For all the detractors of this film, i just can say that just time will give this film the place it deserves in the history of cinema. I could write lines and lines worshiping AVATAR, but i just wanted to share my opinion about it, and widely recommend it to every person who wants to be amazed and behold the talent of a true master. I can assure you that you won't regret it.....Ricardo Gomez Veracruz, Mexico",positive
611,"I'll start by saying that the visual effects are astounding, the movie its great to watch but what is important in this masterpiece and will make you love it, is the message(else it would not be a masterpiece at all and just another great 3D movie).This story has been told over and over again but never with such power. For the first time the viewer can really relate to the characters and to their cause. Its all about power against love and ugliness against beauty. And I put the bad guys first cause even if the good guys win one battle, its clear that the war its not over yet.Its a message to the good guys to get up and fight. They do not have the upper hand but they can still win.:) We are destroying our ecosystem(and ourselves with it) right now for money and power and we should stop it. A new strategy is necessary.",neutral
612,"So the movie is very....beautiful to watch. You cant believe all of this is not true...So technically, this film is brilliant. But they're is no scenario. The plot is so predicable, every character is so caricatured. Like every movie from Hollywood, you can predict which character will die. The bad guys are so bad, the good guy are so good. ( the main character is not very nice at the beginning but of course he will overcome his issues and at the end he will become better) In 3d the photography wasn't that beautiful,its a bit blurry and out of focus, i think this movie is gonna be gorgeous on blue-ray. Its not a science fiction movie, its just a movie with a lot of visuals effect. Its a good entertainment, but you wont get blown away by the story.",positive
613,"Blockbuster movies come in dozens these years, special effects flood us with so much flash and bang and hiss that we went blind and deaf to them long ago. Maybe that's why I see some people automatically discard the new Cameron movie - only because they saw on trailers it has special effects. I say let them stay ignorant, for they are only hurting themselves. And for all of you that love cinema, and waited so long for that sense of wonder, that was lost for decades - wait no longer and buy a ticket and watch Avatar in 3D and your inner child's most incredible dreams will come true before your very eyes.Why is it so different? We saw a jungle and monsters and wild chases before - in King Kong for example - so why bother? Isn't it the same? The answer will hit you while you immerse yourself in the world of Pandora. We became immune to 2D, we stopped caring long ago. But this is different. You ARE inside, you are no longer an external viewer, you are a silent actor that is following the actors - on a strange, wonderful alien planet. You share their amazement and emotions, fears and desires.Cameron created something you can believe in, a world that is so coherent and *real* it sucks you in completely, and after the movie is over you wish to go back to Pandora and experience its beauty again. It might well be the most artistic movie ever made, the details of the ecosystem connect with the story perfectly, allowing us to see more of Pandora's rich environment. I really wish I could tell more without risking spoilers.The story is what you expect it to be. If you have any movie experience you will not be surprised and will predict what happens up to last second of the movie - but I tell you it doesn't matter at all! You will actually want for it to happen the way it happens - and Cameron simply knows that. I realize it would seem the movie must be very boring because of that - but the truth is you will not get out of amazement for the whole duration of the movie. I can hardly believe it myself.I am not mentioning special effects - because there were none - if you ask me it was all real. Cameron took his camera team to another world inhabited by Na'vi. And that comes from a guy who knows effects by heart and is immune to most of the flashy trash we are served year after year. Avatar is one giant quantum leap to match.It's more than a movie, it is an experience. It is art. It is fantasy with emotions and important messages crucial to the world today. Give your inner child a favor, and believe the hype - you will not regret it. See it in 3D - words can't describe the feeling.You won't believe your eyes.",positive
614,"This film is overrated, and I can't believe that it's score is in the same range as Dark City and The Man from Earth, is hardly even compares.Alright, maybe I'm biased towards my own pro-ideas rather than pro-action movie opinions, but honestly, there is little or no story to it, and the SFX really didn't impress me as much as I was told they would.How could this film get the same rating as District 9? District 9 had an innovative idea, a brilliant plot, and a truly plausible storyline. I gave this film a six only because of the SFX - the plot, to me, was quite predictable. I won't wreck it for anyone who DOES choose to see the movie, however.If you like entirely action movies, then this is for you, but if you want something with a good plot, see Dark City or District 9.I'm being critical here, but I would be less critical if this film had what it deserved, a 5 or a 6.",neutral
615,"Avatar is a beautiful and amazing movie on humans that set their feet on the planet of other creatures, the na'vi. The story is really gripping and the way the story has been told is award deserving. James Cameron is back with a bang after nearly a decade, and what a jump he has made of genres. From a romantic drama called Titanic, to a pathbreaking cinematic 3D experience called Avatar.While watching this movie, I was so involved with whatever I saw, just like Jake Sully, I started connecting with the world of the Na'vi, and felt anger when the humans starting demolishing it. This is the magic and affect of the storytelling of James Cameron. He uses the complete first hour to make the audience connect and create love for that earth-like world of the Na'vi, the creatures on the planet and the beautiful nature.The way James Cameron has written, handled and directed the story deserves accolades and awards, I have never felt this amazed by a movie before. Performances of the movie are of A+ class quality, even though the movie does not have big names yet, the characterisation of each and every actor is completely in sync with the characters of the movie. Sam Worthington has done a commendable job as Jake Sully, he is very convincing, and has honest expressions. Jake in his Avatar form is absolutely lovable, and has been executed perfectly. Zoe Saldana as Neytiri is beautiful, she truly looks like the princess of the race, and has done a remarkable job. The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful and very impactful.The dosing of humour is perfect, not too much, and not too less of it. The 3D special effects are a milestone in the history of 3D cinematic experiences. Never has any special effect involved me so much. The natural environment looks astonishing and absolutely beautiful, the way production has been designed is very peaceful. The creators of the exterior of this movie have done a commendable job.All in all, I can't describe my feelings for this movie in a review. You have to see this movie with your own eyes, you have to experience it in order to understand what Avatar has to offer. Go watch it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Avatar is quality product in all perspectives, a milestone in the history of cinema. Thumbs up!",positive
616,"Okay, so....there are these people who wear leaves, live in perfect peace and harmony and faith, hope, and charity (I'd be willing to bet that they can sing ""Kum-Ba-Yah"" nonstop through an entire weekend). And they all live in this happy singing all the day long place which looks like an enormous tropical tree. But then there are rough, bad, mean people who probably don't even know the words to ""Kum-Ba-Yah"" and have big guns and lots of ugly machinery besides. They want something that can only begotten if that big tropical tree is tipped over in very dramatic fashion. And they're so nasty that they don't have any qualms about ""putting down the natives"".Okay, you get it by now, right? You've seen it in plenty of space operas, ecological parables, every movie about colonialism, and who knows where else. So....more or less like a James Bond movie, when you plunk down your money and take your seat, you know exactly what you're going to see even before the lights dim.And you just might enjoy it. The visual effects are fascinating (even to this viewer who did not see it in 3D), the acting is decent enough if a fair number of the characters are cardboard, and even though it's been done before, it's a worthy story (and probably always will be).This movie is a great thrill ride. Unfortunately, the preaching tends to get in the way of the ride, and the ride tends to get in the way of the preaching. If ""Avatar"" could simply make up its mind as to whether it wants to be a just plain cool visual experience or a polemic reaching for every cliché in the book to be a ""message movie"", it would be a lot more enjoyable to folks who are looking for either. By trying to please both, ultimately, it disappoints all.James Cameron might have done better to split the budget in half and make two separate movies with it. But....that wouldn't really be his style, would it?",neutral
617,"I'm giving this movie a 2/10 because undeniably the art and beauty that is the setting of Avatar is outstanding. It's a gorgeous movie but I find it offensive as a movie-goer that we should be expected just to like a movie because the hype and a gorgeous setting.This movie severely lacked plot and character development, especially the latter. The main character had some depth but the supporting cast had very little, and I did not feel at all attached to their causes or goals. The movie was far too long to cover as little as it did, there was more to uncover about the characters, their past, and how they interacted with one another but it was shown through quickly progressing scenes, with little dialogue relying on the score and beauty of the setting to speed us through the time of the movie. Months were shown over the matter of minutes, which would be okay if they had some fully formed characters I could believe in, but that was not the case here.As mentioned in other reviews, the plot originality is severely lacking, I found myself during nearly the entire movie thinking..""oh this is just like that movie"" or ""that is just like this movie"". That's not to say that similar themes are recycled in many modern movies, but this one wasn't even cobbled together convincingly to be its own story, you can see the loose threads of other movies everywhere, only turned into a Avatar themed world. Clichés abound here. This movie is getting way more positive reviews than it deserves probably because of the expert animation/visual effects and the huge hype before hand. It's disappointed to see such a sub-par movie getting such a fabulous reaction from movie-goers, we deserve better. Hype+Stunning Visual Effects does not equal great cinema.",negative
618,"Avatar is a visual poem. It is not the story, but the way it is told that makes you feel what the director felt and let you have a beautiful experience. Even the critics reckon that the visual experience is extraordinary and this can not be told. It must be seen in a cinema, and best in the company your loved ones.One can say that La Traviata has a poor, predictable story about a man and an ill women that can not be together. But if you know the story, you will not go to see it? Everything must be an epic today and we can not see lyric movies? When the starting speech of the colonel is pus out of focus, we are warned by Jack that we should not let our minds at ease and try to move out of the comfort of everyday speeches that tell us what to do. If you do this, you will the same beautiful experience that I did and enjoy the eye-opening final. Walt Disney's Snow White is released on Blu-ray 70+ years after it was created even if everybody knows the story, so we can also feel good when Neytiri wakes Jake with a kiss. You must stop worrying about world or galaxy politics and economics and enjoy simple emotions. Fortunately, the director made this very easy and only the ones wondering if Snow White will get a divorce will not be able to feel the simple joy of flying free or the joy of walking barefoot into Pandora's forest.You have to see it in 3D to fully understand what a great job James Cameron has done as a director. He is not showing off the technology like most in the industry now, but he understood that filming in a virtual environment he can do with the camera things that are impossible in the real world. So you will feel like you are running in the forest with the action, you will feel like flying with the action and you almost feel the smell of the forest. He understood also that 3D is not like the real world or a hologram, where the focus is where you set your eyes to look, and he used the focus combined with 3D in a creative way. And what a marvelous result! Thank you James Cameron for getting us a glimpse of what the holodeck must be feeling!",positive
619,"Wow.I just returned from seeing this movie in 2D, and it truly was fantastic. I plan on going back to watch it again in 3D, as I hear it is even better. Setting/Environment: 10/10 The setting in this movie is gorgeous. Absolutely fantastic. James Cameron really has created the most wonderful world I've ever seen. From start to finish the movie was simply visually stunning. If you're interested in seeing the most fantastic CGI ever presented, go see this movie.Characters: 10/10 Like all movies, the viewer must suspend reality a bit here and there to enjoy the full spectrum of what the movie has to offer. Avatar is no different - viewers trying to match the film to real life at every turn will walk away disappointed. Those who can relax a bit and invest themselves in the movie just a tad will find themselves become quickly attached to the characters as portrayed by a mostly great cast of actors. Sam Worthington is very convincing in his portrayal of a wheelchair-bound veteran who revels in his newfound freedom, and effectively carries the movie on his shoulders. I found it very easy to follow Sam's feelings and thoughts as the movie progressed. Overall, a great job with the characters draws the viewer into the movie even more.Plot: 8/10 Yes, the plot is nothing new. So what? This movie simply wouldn't have worked with an overly complicated plot line and lots of twists. The plot was not the theme of this movie. Rather than a story based film, it was a focused introduction to the wonderful world of Pandora. That being said, the story was delivered in a clear and enjoyable manner. The task of the story in this film is to give the viewer an easy to follow yet enjoyable ride that allows full appreciation of the visuals and characters, which are the main strong points of the movie. A few corny moments aside, it does exactly that. We all had that one book as a child that we knew by heart, yet read again. Like with that book, the familiar plot in this movie doesn't really take away from the movie, like many claim. And again like that book, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable even if you do see most of it coming. That being said, the movie certainly doesn't reveal everything at once. I still had questions in my mind about the resolution of the plot and the final development path of several of the characters when entering the last portions of the movie. Sure, it's not an Oscar winning story, but if you're willing to relax and not psycho-analyze it, it keeps you happy and entertained as you enjoy the other aspects of the movie.Overall: 10/10 Although this is not a mathematical fit to my rating breakdown, I feel that setting and characters should be weighted more highly than plot in this movie. Where it really tries the hardest, this movie succeeds in grand splendor. Do yourself a favor. Go watch it. Cheers!",positive
620,"I went to the cinema not really sure if I was going to like this. I was worried that I'd spend the (almost) three hours wanting to do anything but watch this, and did not expect to have a new favourite film by the end of it.The effects, as you can expect, were the best I've ever seen ever; it was almost better than reality. We were on a new planet 'Pandora' and it was all so real. There were new animals, aliens, and plants and no matter how illogical they were they were still made believable with all of the cinematography.The storyline wasn't the best ever but it was still made great by the feelings that the audience had from the characters, and the question of 'who is morally right?' The 3D wasn't as good as the quality of the effects, but it wasn't worth complaining about because this was one of the best films I'd seen in my life. This was a visual masterpiece. Watch it while it's still in cinemas to see a film at its best.",positive
621,"Just seen the movie..wow what a movie!! Every frame depicts the hard work of each n every technician behind it Though the story line of the movie is predictable..Cameron shows us Every scene like never before!! Most of the part is been picturized in the dream world ""Pandora"" The chemistry between Cast of this movie Sam Worthington,Zoe Saldana worked out perfectly!! The creatures of the Pandora planet were designed well and one can observe the creativity of technicians Action scenes were absolutely stunning and amazing undoubtedly and yeah i have to search the dictionary to praise this movie!! and i'll bet..This movie will be the best Sci-Fi flicks ever made..Although movie got hype before the release..it had satisfied audience with the ultimate taking Finally,Hats Off to Cameron and believe me this is the best bet this week!!And what are you looking for?rush into your nearest theatres and enjoy the thrill of the 'A V A T A R'....The movie will be better experienced in 3D..go and enjoy it!!",positive
622,"I saw Avatar at a preview screening two days ago and I have waited until now to comment on the movie because it left me in a state of shock and wonderment. As a technical achievement in film making, James Cameron's new visual masterpiece follows in the footsteps of Metropolis (1927), Forbidden Planet (1956), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), Star Wars (1977), Alien (1979), Bladerunner (1982), TRON (1982), The Abyss (1989) and Jurassic Park (1993) as an absolute benchmark in visual effects.James Cameron has pushed motion capture and computer generated imagery to its current full potential, previously only hinted at in the last decade in films such as the Star Wars prequels and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The last two years have seen impressive visual effects work in films such as Transformers and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but Avatar makes such leaps ahead that it is truly unlike any movie I have ever seen. Its world is so immersive (helped by great and subtle use of 3D) and its characters, alien wildlife and futuristic war machines so detailed and larger than life, that I feel this movie will set the gold standard for the entire decade to come.It may sound like I am merely judging this movie on its incredible visuals alone, but my emphasis on discussing the look of the movie is only because that is the main draw on first viewing. Beyond its effects, the film has much more to offer. Whilst somewhat simplistic and drawn in very broad strokes, the story is a timeless one that deserves to be retold in such grand fashion for this new generation. I have heard criticism of the film's dialogue, but I loved it. Several lines, especially those delivered by Stephan Lang, had me giggling in a good way. Speaking of Lang, he makes a truly great villain, and his final battle against the film's protagonists is one of the better fight scenes I have seen in the last few years. It isn't as drawn out and entertaining as the fight in They Live (1988), but it is pretty damn epic !See Avatar on the biggest screen possible in 3D. It is the must see film event of the year. What an experience !",neutral
623,"Well, like some of you, I registered solely so I could vent my spleen about this movie. James Cameron should be ashamed of this plot line. How many times must we watch a movie that portrays 'the military' as just not giving a hoot about who they kill providing they get the minerals out of the ground. I was actually a bit angry about this movie. Must be because I thought the huge tree was great and, of course, the military just had to blow it up. For what?? Unobtainium? Is this the same unobtainium that they spoke of in ""The Core""? At least we saw what that was. I knew before I saw this that the plot was not much, but the plot has been done to death so many times before and it really is predictable and horrid.The performances were quite passable and I've got nothing to quibble about.Visually, yes, it's stunning. And I only watched it on a 42"" LCD TV!! Somehow, I never quite got to see this at the theater. Mr Cameron has created an amazing world that is visually awesome. It almost sets a new benchmark for what can be achieved. It's just such a shame about the storyline! I'll most likely watch it again anyway!!",neutral
624,"This is a must see. So imaginative, so creative. after you watch it, you realize why it took so many years (definitely of hard work) to produce. For so many years I haven't been as moved by a picture as with Avatar. It is not only a technical and visually flawless movie (like everyone says), but it is also a great and profound story. It combines action, spirituality, love, humor and it actually brings a great message to the audience. It is a trip; you actually leave your seat and travel to the world of Pandora (where the Avatar story is developed). For a time you feel intrigued, after a while amazed, then completely outraged and finallywell go see it. After watching the movie and exiting the cinema, it is amazing how gray reality appears (I mean literally, the movie is so colorful). With the risk of sounding like a nerd, it actually made want to be a Na'vi (the people that live in Pandora), share their beliefs and live in the world of Pandora.From the message standpoint, I may only add that the movie actually tells us something about how destructive we are, as a human raze. Earth has so many places like Pandora; just take a look at the Amazons. We have to preserve it.",positive
625,"Avatar tells the story of a man who is paralyzed from the waist down, and through controlling an alien body with his mind, gets more and more absorbed into the alien culture, their respect for the world around them, and their fight against encroachment by humans.For someone who typically dislikes movies which try to walk the line between mindless blockbuster and subtle storytelling, Avatar exceeds expectations. There was a ridiculous amount of hype for a movie which appeared to have graphics which were nothing new, and a silly story. Well, the graphics are better than expected. The story is not told in an especially compelling way, due to the blockbuster style where everything is just as it seems and the plot flows in a straight line. However, the world of Pandora is quite immersive, especially in 3D, so the graphics make this movie. While the effects, especially of alien characters and animals, still do not quite look like they were filmed, the trees and rocks are very convincing. The 3D interfaces that the humans use for their computers are slick, the ships look real, and the mystical glowing alien plants and insects are cool.The live-action 3D is very engaging for now, although a little glitchy. Most likely we will look back on this movie in the future and wince, after the technique is improved. For example, sometimes the side of an actor's face has a strong highlight as seen by one camera, but not by the other, which produces a disorienting effect when one of the viewer's eyes sees the highlight but not the other.As for the story and message, it is a rather standard one of not messing with nature and the indigenous people, which honestly distracts from the expected brainless blockbuster action, romance, and coming of age story. Many of the serious things in this movie were done better in Mononoke-hime. The parts where it is a blockbuster work well enough despite somewhat uninspired action, and it probably would have been better if it had stayed fun and dumb. All in all, worth watching, but by a slim margin.",neutral
626,"I went to see this film with very high expectations. As I sat in the theater I thought to myself, 'well, now I'm going to watch a masterpiece.' With such high expectations, you'd think I was going to be easily disappointed, but I wasn't. This film fulfilled my highest expectations. I've got friends who've gone all intellectual and muttered about the shallow characters and weak script, but as far as I'm concerned they're the ones who are losing out. If you go to watch this movie, just immerse yourself in the spectacle and enjoy the ride. It's spectacular. I didn't have any problems at all with the story line. It made me think of the old colonial days and what has been going down for centuries in the name of business. To have such a visually spectacular piece of art with such a noble message is a double blessing. Don't ruin it with your cynicism. Just enjoy it. I'll be going to see it again.",positive
627,"After much speculation i finally saw Avatar. Mmm... Where do i start? The graphics were of course great filled with pretty good acting to back up the lengthy story line. If you have children or you yourself enjoy animated movies sorta say than this movie would be great.Now, would i watch this movie again? No. I don't care how much money anyone pays me. 2+ hours sitting watching this movie got to be difficult at times. It's really overrated in my opinion. It was good yes, things were done here that have never been seen yes again but it's really isn't movie of the decade let alone of the year.How it grossed over 2 billion is really beyond me because there were much better movies out at the time. But again, this is one of those movies that some people will really either love it or hate it.",positive

629,"My first thought was, the 3-D isn't as good as I was led to believe, but then something straightened out. I'm not sure whether it was my brain or the screen, but either way the problem cleared up fairly quickly. (Though pretty entertaining I don't think the movie is going to suffer much from begin watched in 2-D.) My second thought was, everyone who fancies himself a little above average or more in intelligence should be forced to watch this film. If you're right, you will come away convinced you've been touched by the work of someone far more intelligent than you. If you don't feel that way, you're initial assumption was clearly wrong.This film is not miraculous in an off-putting sort of way. It is geared to reach the average American mind. The thing is, I remember having similar sentiments as this film, years ago, and I would have bet anything that getting ordinary Joes to sympathize with its point of view was an exercise in sheer futility. That to me is the real mark of genius in this film, that James Cameron was able to make it so that no one is likely to escape being confronted with its message, though whether they believe it or not, I can't say. The whole of my own belief about this country's foreign policy to date is stated fairly simply in a very few words. It begins with: ""We want something someone else has..."" There's no doubt in my mind many won't care, but this film will stir the optimism of the rest of us about there being sufficient numbers of those who do care to make a difference.Everyone in this film does an exemplary job. There's a slight skip of a beat in the middle but, if it hadn't been there, I might very well have stumbled out of the theater totally disoriented, unable to snap back into my humdrum life.What a stunning accomplishment!",positive
630,"As always for James Cameron movies, this has been an extremely well-researched one. I am a sci-fi & science fan, and a researcher by profession. Good sci-fi movies intrigue me. But in recent times it seemed that directors & writers had lost ideas. The last real good ones I watched were the Matrix and the Terminator(s). Since then it has been suffocating years of crappy sci-fi concepts in movies. ""Avatar"" feels like a fresh new breeze. Besides all the excellent special effects, the concepts are very well-grounded from a scientific perspective. I like the way Cameron has fantasized of establishing direct neural connection between organisms, and the depicted ""soul"" as information content in neural networks. If one has read scientific articles on possibilities of extraterrestrial life forms and how evolution can create & mold life under bizarre environments, one would readily be able to appreciate the life-form designs & concepts in the movie. Hat's off to James Cameron - looking forward to the sequels.",positive
631,"We have only one complaint about this movie. Many good reviews have already been written here...many also are spoilers which is a shame. The experience should not be spoiled by anything other than ones own imagination which, for this film is not difficult. It does not take much predicting to preceded the story in your mind as you watch. Very few surprises are written into the story but that in NO WAY takes away from the power of the story. All a viewer needs to know before hand are what is presented in story synopsis which do not reveal the ending or resolution of any number of conflicts that arise in a good story. We compare the impact of this movie to that of the Lord of the Rings. The fantasy creatures become very believable very quickly and give the viewer a sense of being among them. We completely forgot all the hype about the animation and effects and watched the film in 3D (highly recommended) as if we were watching life action. Our only complaint is in the casting of Sigourney Weaver. She does not have the ability to act beyond her past roles. Alien clings to her like irremovable paint. The film excelled in finding so many good actors that were not beset by past roles. Putting Sigourney Weaver in the role she plays could only be compared to casting Nicolas Cage instead of Sam Worthington and John Travolta instead of Steven Lang. Thank goodness Cameron had the sense not to do that.",positive
632,"Even critics of action and science fiction movies would be hard pressed to not like this film. The story line is not exceptional but the message is a powerful one, perfect for anyone who cares about the environment, and for young people who may not have strong awareness of what corporations and governments can do to people and the environment for the sake of profit. The battle to save Pandora and its life forms translates to our very own planet. It is a humane and emotional story about a soldier who comes to understand what his employers are about to do. I applaud Cameron for giving this film some depth to compliment to powerful special effects.Only see this film in 3-D. It is a remarkable technical achievement as it takes us into another world full of natural wonders and nature based inhabitants. The entire film in it's 3-D glory is engrossing, from the fancy technology of the invaders, to the beauty of the Pandora environment.",positive
633,"Anytime a movie this hyped comes out the natural reaction will always be a non-critical endorsement of its ""awesomeness."" Science fiction fanboys often lack the ability to separate excitement from any objective critique of movies that play to their sentimentality's. Don't get me wrong, this is a feel good and visually spectacular movie that has the viewer awestruck leaving the theater. However, this can be said about a July 4th fireworks display or a Las Vegas magic act; just because it's entertaining does not make it worthy of praise - just look at the news. It is necessary to take some time to reflect on the film for what it is - a film, and should be held up to the time-honored standards of all film criticisms.To begin, I think it's worth noting that the main thrust of creativity in Avatar comes from solely the visual aspects - if you want to see it then the 3D format does make a difference. The plot has little creativity, it's mostly a splicing of Dances with Wolves, Aliens, and a little Fern Gully. This has led some to joke that the only original cast member was Sigourney Weaver. Sam Worthington plays the role of Kevin Costner while Giovanni Ribisi replaces Paul Reiser for the role of the corporate shill. Michelle Rodriguez even closely resembles the Latin stereotype of Private Vasquez from Aliens. Given these obvious parallels and recycling, we should be comparing this movie to Dances with Wolves and Cameron's Aliens and unfortunately Avatar just does not stack up. The messages of the movies are similar yet Avatar lacks the depth of Dances or even Aliens, instead choosing to hand feed and spell it out for the viewer and watering down complex issues of imperialism and corporate motives present in this movie's predecessors.Furthermore, while Dances is comparably long, Avatar spends most of the film developing a world instead of a plot and focusing more on being visually appealing than attempting to challenge the viewer - although this might be a side-effect of making science fiction rather than historical fiction.All in all the acting was fine, the action was fun, but these can be found in most films. Would I recommend it? Yes, I enjoyed it, but I also enjoyed Grandma's Boy and that's hardly deserving of the top 50 movies of all time. And on a side note: do not watch Grandma's Boy before this film or else you won't be able to take Joel Moore's character seriously.And on one last note, further enforcing this notion of how watered down this film is are the constant commercial tie-ins that have been littering TV to promote it. The film's message seems inherently at odd with McDonald's actions as both a corporation exploiting indigenous populations and in terms of the products they sell.I highly advise people to examine this film critically and as a film rather than a fireworks show.",neutral
634,"This movie is enjoyable across all age groups and anyone who says differently is probably just being a killjoy.For example if you're the type of movie watcher who likes to point out things like ""McGuffins"" and ""Deus ex Machinas"" you may not be able to like a movie like this.Is there social commentary in this movie? Sure. But Sci Fi tends to lend itself to that. I personally didn't mind it at all hence my rating of 10. If you're sensitive to this kind of thing you may like the movie less than I did. But it is still 100 percent worth watching.Also special recognition should be paid to the cast here. Worthington is great as a new face who plays his role very adequately. Sigourney Weaver is a great addition. And Michelle Rodriguez brings some nice spirit to the production as well.",positive
635,"So was the experience worth it? You bet, save for the end credits being unceremoniously cut off toward the end because of another screening. James Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction and the creation of new worlds, having been there and done that, even when there are quarters which point to plot similarities. He had continued Ridley Scott's Alien and made the sequel just as, if not even more memorable, having a Titanic film that stood out amongst those created before his technological marvel, gave spy films a good run with his True Lies, and even upping the ante of his own Terminator film with its sequel (which those that followed struggling hard to fill those shoes he left behind).To say Cameron was a technology junkie is quite the understatement. For each film that he made, there's something new added with a Wow factor, and I still remember to this day the liquid T1000 rising from a patterned floor, making the ugly Harrier jet look sexy, and made us gawk at the recreation of the ill fated ocean liner. Between that film and this one, he had made another 3D documentary exploring the wreckage of the Titanic, and I've watched that on 3D IMAX, which sadly such a hall no longer exists in Singapore. The 3D experience now with Avatar is nothing short of mind-blowing, for the first few minutes at least, and it subconsciously just melts into the background as you continue to enjoy the visuals of the film, hardly noticing the effort that had gone in creating that depth of field or the photo- realism of the fantasy realm of beautiful alien flora and floating mountains, as if you're now watching something real that's unfolding as if you're staring out with your very own eyes, witnessing a perfect blend of live action and computer generated wizardry.He's created a new world with Avatar, which may have jolly well been Dances with Science Fiction Wolves, or any parallels with other films cutting so close that it's easy to scream plagiarism, but like the title of the film, it's only a vessel in which to tell the story of what's probably a major mind-set shift of how a science fiction 3D film should be like, and exploited for the modern audience. The story has been told countless of times in many different forms, about the prophetic messiah who would come from outside the community, to lead them against adversary. And although the idea has been reported mooted at least a decade back, one cannot but feel how close the concept of Nature Vs Man being all the more relevant now, with that constant reminder that Nature will fight back one day, and Man will be on the losing end should we be up against a concerted force.Sam Worthington continues his charge as leading man material, even though he's covered in blue and in gangly animated form for more than half the time He's the perennial flawed hero (and I think come complete with touched up limbs) who sees his initial mission as a chance to reclaim what was, only to find that the grass is greener on the other side, due to what else, but love. That pits him against his master, and his dilemma to regain the trust of a community that he had chosen to betray and regret. I can't help but to compare his Marine Jack Sully to Kevin Costner's John Dunbar, with his time spent living amongst the natives (here it's 3 months worth) and to learn their ways, so much so that he's more of them than he is from his own, despite the need to report back, and knowing that they will be the eventual enemy when push comes to shove regarding land and minerals.And the great good versus evil divide comes from Colonel Miles, played to wicked perfection by Stephen Lang as the war mongering officer who just can't wait to lock and load and pick a fight given any opportunity, and the diplomatic scientist Dr. Grace (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew, who are all for mutual co-existence and the sharing of cultures in a bid to understand what makes the native Na'vi tick, not to mention the countless of secrets that lie hidden in their eco-system, besides some valuable mineral to mine, the largest deposit which is sitting directly under the Na'vi's million year old giant tree.In the Na'vis, Cameron has created quite the indigenous alien beings complete with a pigtail, which can be used to plug into nature, from binding and controlling just about every living creature (there was a mating scene, though I didn't get to see if this was put to good use), and to plug themselves into a spiritual realm as well. I suppose this provides for plenty of empathy, and I liked the part where Zoe Saldana's Neytiri chides Jake for thanking her when she fatally dispatches the more aggressive beings which in a way, were provoked to action. Action too is something not short of in the film, though one must be patient for that full scale, all out war that was done quite in the mold of Battle For Terra, leaving you without a doubt who to root for.I don't suppose this film will make as much at the box office as Cameron's last even though it shared that similar romantic angle behind events that are of a higher magnitude. Instant classic this is not, but Avatar has its moments, primed for a sequel or even for an expanded television series, that could continue on its ecological message, its technical wizardry, or just plain old narrative familiarity that could put the spotlight on the other hastily added clans that made up the final stretch.",positive
636,"Finally,yesterday night I got the opportunity to watch Avatar in the Imax 3d.After watching the movie, i can aver that it is the best-of- decade.Great acting,magnum opus visual effects and excellent screen play and direction to perfection has made Avatar one the best movies ever made on the silver screen.i don't want to reveal story content but i can say that Avatar has got every thing to spellbind you.Go and watch avatar and locate yourself in the world of Pandora.Watch Avatar only in 3d because the special effects are so good that you won't believe your eyes.At last, i want to say a big thanks to JAMES CAMERON for giving us the movie AVATAR.",positive
637,"I saw it on 2D yesterday. Let me say two things here, this is NOT the Cameron who made T2 and Aliens .and maybe all those special effects are worth the money spent on the admission ticket. I think Cameron made this movie for the studios(FOX){he's on a fixed salary from Fox;and last I read ,it had many leading zeros}}whereas T2, aliens were movies that he made for himself and there's the subtle difference. The story has potential but is not expertly delivered. I mean why spend zillions on hi-tech labs with neurosynaptic links with human hosts when an hour later ,all you have to do is let the trigger happy corporate honchos blast the navi village out of oblivion;why not just do it even before the first brick of such a lab even gets laid....sorry story here is not really consistent. Cameron has not shown anything that has not been shown to audiences in the last 15 -20 years in Hollywood. 1)robot suit fighters = robot suit donned by Sig. weaver in aliens 2)battle of choppers (hi-Tech) v/s beasts and rodents(lo-tech) = starship troopers.3)tough talking female chopper pilot = from 'Pvt. Vasquez'fame in aliens 4)trigger happy corporate honchos = same stuff as in 1985 aliens,anything new? 5)literally the 'Red leader' squadron act at the end (rebels taking on the Imperial might) = star wars and many more ;Cameron is out of ideas and has just reimplemented those great ideas he made up in his hey days. Avatar is no way close to T2 ,Aliens but did I say ,hey it's worth the penny..... just to gape and awe at the Sfx. used.",neutral
638,"Ferngully in 3D. Wow. Seriously? How can you have this completely lame story with these pretty cool 3D effects and win awards? Hey, baby - it's Hollywood. I am not even sure there's much more to say - even the effects were not as spectacular as some folk made it seem. The blue folk seemed pretty bizarre on their own, but later in the movie when they showed them next to their human counterparts, we can see that while the 3D is much improved, the graphics have not evolved one whit farther than Jar-jar Binks. I mean, honestly - as long as you twits keep forking out dollars James T Cameron Diaz is gonna make another version.And you'll eat it with forks. Me? I say, ""fork this!""",negative
639,"Lets clear the air first, Avatar is one of the greatest if not the greatest film ever made on a large scale.Even though the CGI was state of the art and is to this date unmatched, as opposed to 2012 it was not just an engine to impress the audience with its cgi, it adds another to the dimension to the story telling which was actually magnificent to say the least. Yes i know people have said it is a copy of other stories such as Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, Alien, it doesn't matter it is completely irrelevant, James Cameron makes this story his own. As soon as pandora was shown i was completely sold, absolutely breath taking shots. I was taken back to my child hood, i could feel myself welling up with tears as it gave a sense of awe and wonderment i had not felt in years. The story was completely balanced, it embodied everything we love james cameron for, emotion, empathy, character development and everything else. to be honest its really difficult to try and explain in such small gap the entire spectrum of this film and everything it contains, don't ask just watch it.",positive
640,"I'll try and not spoil too much with this review.OS = This movie is easily among st one of the best movies I have seen, but that seemed to be the case when it comes to James Cameron movies.1= This movie is visually stunning right from the beginning not only visually stunning but also beautiful, you could also pause the movie at any point and your TV could be doubled as a over sized picture frame.2= Not only this movie allows you to understand the Avatar Universe early but it also makes it easy for you to understand the Avatar Universe.3= The plot from the movie to me feels almost like it could be a Star Trek Movie (NOT JJ ABREMS REBOOT). Of curse I'm talking about the classic Star Trek Movies.4= There is an Alien creature in the movie that kind of looks like of an Alien Xenomorph.5= The Pandora Planet also an African Jungle Amazon feel an look to it. The reason I found that interesting is because that is all I was thinking about while I was watching the movies as to the regards of the sitting in which the movie takes place.6= As I was watching the movie I feel that the over all message of the movie is Cultural Understanding, and Cultural Acceptance more Understanding than Acceptance. Which goes along with my Statement from above. About the movie feeling like an idea for a Classic Star Trek Movie.7= In addition as I was watching the movie I was constantly reminded of the metaphor of the old West in which the people in the West invade and attack the Native Americans but in space. In this case the Humans are the Western Invaders, and the Na'vi are the Native Americans.8= The VO (Voice Over) in the movie is really great, it is told in the format of a Video Diary, and I'm not just talking about Jack the main character telling us what's going in the terms of his mission, but also in the terms of his changing feelings through out the movie and what is he planing what to do. And it's not your typical Video Diary VO either, it's not just VO in the beginning to open the movie and at the same time explain to us the audience what the world of Pandora is. And another VO at the end to close the movie up and at the same time to show what the effects of climax events had on both sides. No it's not like that at all, Jack the main character constantly provides his VO in his POV so it truly becomes a Video Dairy, and not just away for us the audience to know what is going on. And I like that it gives you a sense of feeling that the audience is a character in the movie, and that the main character Jack is constantly reporting back to you the audience in Video Diary format. Like you are an government official back on earth or something. I like movies that have that, it's too bad that not more movies have that.9= Another thing I have noticed while watching the movie is that the main bases for the Na'vi Cutler, is being one with Nature. Now the Na'vi are literally one with Nature, but it got me thinking maybe humans should be with one with Nature. I'm talking MORE than JUST camping and hugging trees, no I'm talking about NOT holding innocent animals captive and NOT shooting innocent animals just for the sport of it. I think the only justly reasons to kill an animal is, A when you are protecting your self, and B when you need you need food while in nature. For me those are the ONLY two justly reasons to kill an animal(s), and the like. So in short I think we should try and take a page from the Na'vi Cutler's book and try and coexist with animals, because if we don't then I would agree with Agent Smith in the first Matrix movie when he said that Humans are nothing but a Diseases Plague a Cancer for this planet. I don't know about you but the very idea bring compered to an Infection is uneasy to me to say the least.10= Any ways back to the cherry stuff, this movie is not only beautiful visually but as for the Emotional aspect that is also beautiful.11= The Soundtrack. Not only it's the one of the best Soundtracks I have heard in any movie, but also the Soundtrack helps you care about the characters and what's going on at that point in time in the movie. But also at one point in the movie I thought the Soundtrack was so good I not only thought to myself that I got to get this Soundtrack, but also some of the music for this movie is so relaxing it puts you in a Meditative State at least it did for me. And on top of all that the Soundtrack for this movie I found that it also helps you get invested in more than just the characters in the movie but it also gets you invested in the movie as a whole, on what is happening at that point in the movie on what is about to happen, etc.CS= Now the movie is not perfect I did have some minor problems in it, such as the Climax fight. And I have to admit at some parts it's really predictable like predicting who the real villain is early on in the movie. And finally I'm not sure this movie really needs a sequel, much less multiple sequels, to me it wraps everything up nicely. The only reason to make sequel(s) to this movies is I'm sorry to say Greed",positive
641,"Developed as a action/fantasy/sci-fi film it has all the makings of a wonderful story. The cinematography is truly magnificent as are the scenery and tremendous action sequences. A film that has heart, defines what humanity is on a completely different level. Jake Sully (Worthington) is a paralyzed Marine in a wheel chair that takes his murdered brother's place to go to the moon Pandora. He has no science background, just the will to complete a mission, he's a soldier. Once there he meets the rough, ego centric Colonel Miles Quaritch) Lang who is hell bent on destroying the Navi civilization. It comes to light money is the root of destroying this peaceful moon. However Jake has a change of heart when he meets Neytiri (Saldana) and learns the ways of the tribe. Sigourney Weaver (Grace) has a pivotal role as lead scientist and really gets inside the reasoning of Jake's turning point. The moons components and CGI effects are amazing to view through the entire film. The character development is slow at first but truly picks up. I really enjoyed the complete package, BUT came away with a similarity of Dances With Wolves. I liked the film but believe it does NOT warrant sequels 2,3,4,5. 8/10",positive
642,"Despite being extremely successful at the box office, Avatar always gets flak for having a poor story line. But is it that bad? I honestly don't think so.Yes, the plot is neither particularly original nor sophisticated, but it is told well. Unlike the second film, were this kind of criticism is much more justified, each setup has its payoff, each character is there for a reason and each scene has a purpose. That's definitely good enough for this kind of a movie and more than a lot of blockbusters nowadays can claim for themselves.In addition the world building (a virtue often overlooked by critics) is top notch as are the visual effects, even a decade later. If you can, watch the extended cut that gives quite a lot more backgound on the conflict between the humans and the Na'vi.",positive
643,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is groundbreaking in many ways. I went to see this at an Imax theater that was sold out for the premiere showing and was duly impressed. The production values are through the roof. I didn't want to flip a magic switch by the first 15 minutes and watch it as a regular movie like I have at every other 3D showing I have been to. That being said, I just didn't see what all fuss was about. You get used to it and it then becomes another pretty movie. I have no trouble watching a movie for the cinematography, alone, but to be a great story you must have something else. The acting, and therefore the directing, what there was of it, was O.K. The story was preachy and in-your-face and I have seen this before. Try ""Dances With Wolves"" in space. Let's give it an ""E"" for effort.",positive
644,"Like many others I watched Avatar as a 3d spectacle of sorts and while the 3D was indeed spectacular, I also mostly remembered it as such.I then watched 7 years on without 3D and was very pleasantly surprised.In my opinion it is better than any science fiction to come after it, with the exception of perhaps Interstellar.On second watching I was mostly surprised by the emotional response I got, despite being essentially Dancing with Wolves in space, or perhaps exactly because of it, I was emotionally invested the entire film and rooting for the hero.It is a beautiful film, also without 3D, amazing CGI, which has also not been topped in 7 years.It's a damn shame Hollywood doesn't take more chances on original material and instead trots out episode 7 of Marvel or constant remakes.",positive
645,"Ultimately Avatar will be remembered more for it's visuals, than it's plot but even as faulty as the movie is, it's still a technical marvel in every way possible that must be seen. Avatar is essentially a sci- fi/adventure flick. Jack Sully (Sam Worthington) Is stuck in a wheelchair an ex-marine, after being given the opportunity to participate in the Avatar experiment, led by Sigourney Weaver's character. Jack must learn from the Na'vi, an alien race that oddly enough have a lot in common with the Indian tribes in the Nature aesthetic. After awhile, Jack feels for the tribe and of course he makes a decision. It ends up being a battle between the human race and the Na'vi. Of course, the human race has the guns and the firepower the Na'vi have bow and arrows so it transcends into how they are going to defeat the humans. The plot in no means is bad, and for an action sci- fi/adventure flick it's beyond those mediocre story-lines seen in other blockbuster movies, however it still feels a bit generic. It just didn't feel original in any way for me. Still, it's a passable story which holds you glued to it, and either-way the general audiences wont care much, as they will enjoy it. It ends up being a beautiful story, if not a flawed one. But where Avatar really hits the cannon is with everything else. It's a visual feast, that puts everything else before it to shame. The CG is simply something that must be seen, as it is jaw dropping. If you see it in 3-D, than the jaw will drop twice more. The combination of live action, and CG is blended perfectly, it is obvious that you will be able to tell apart the CG, but it's still very impressive neither-less. The soundtrack composed by James Horner, is best to be heard elsewhere. It's beautiful, but I didn't see it used efficiently in the movie, or appear as many times as I would have liked. Still when it is there, it definitely is beautiful. The acting is good, as the actors do the best job they could possibly do within the structure of the movie and most importantly they are believable. Sam is fantastic as always, but the real star is Stephan Lang, which pulverises the screen as a villain, and does a great performance while he's at.",positive
646,"Seldom, you find a movie that takes you into it and enthralls you right from the start to the last frame. And only after the movie is over, you realize that man, the joy ride is done now it's time to leave and wish that it would have been there for some more time. AVATAR is one such experience. What is it about?It's in a way story of person saving his race and fighting for it. He wants love, he wants trust. But never did I feel that it was told splendidly as it was done in AVATAR. When a guy who has lost his legs jumps in joy we feel man I would have done that too. When a person with his courage has won the trust of many and feels to lose it then he would do anything to get it back. Each nuance was stunning and oozing in beauty and splendor. A new world PANDORRA has been created and AVATAR makes you feel right there, you can touch those ferns, those plants, those wild animals (or monsters, I can't term them). The screenplay is perfect with each new scene revealing something new and by the end we can figure out what each thing was all about.A scene, in which the lead couple takes a ride and explores PANDORRA, is just one example of beauty that this movie has. The editing is awesome and the acting is apt. The background music, (I concentrated the least as the visuals were too very stunning) is just perfect. But hey, it's not a movie where all these things should be looked into. Just sit in a 3D thing put your goggles and see for the first few minutes after the time would just flew.Kudos, to James Cameron for visualizing AVATAR all in the brain and his crew who meticulously draw translated his vision to screen. It's surely worth the time it took in making and for me it's worth every penny and every second I spent watching it.It's not a must see but a must experience movie. 5/5",positive
647,"There are some light spoilers here just to let you know.I didn't really listen to the hype for this one. I knew that my friends and I wanted to see it but wasn't too sure about it. In short, I was blown away. The story line is great and extremely well written. All the characters you should love, you love. All the characters you should hate, you most definitely hate. The special effects are amazing. They never falter or depreciate over the course of the film. You really get emotionally involved with these characters. My hat is off to James Cameron, because if he can get me more choked up over a made up alien being getting killed than one of the human characters in the film getting killed, you know he's created something astounding. During the film's climax, I felt like i should be fighting with the Na'vi. All the acting is spot on. Worthington is truly great in this. You can easily see his change throughout the course of the film. All-in-all this is an amazing film worth watching. If you're slightly interested, go see it. If you are skeptical about the hype, go see it. If you are completely uninterested, go see it. This is one you won't want to miss.",positive
648,"A masterful polemic by a man who evidently quite properly despises the species he was born into.No expense was spared in this tour-de-force of anti-mankind propaganda, complete with lovely blue kitty-cat aliens, sure to seduce younger viewers into wishing they had been born anything but human, as (with certain Cameron-approved exceptions, such as those who wish to reject their humanity and culture and join the lovely blue kitty-cat opposition) all humans are, as we all know, evil, wanton, destructive demons bent on destroying nature and beauty, preferably with the most flammable means at their disposal.The fact that the plot may be somewhat derivative of a half-dozen or so prior films should in no way detract from the important message this film has to deliver of the basic worthlessness of all human culture up to this point (except for Native American, Asian, African and anywhere else that isn't Western European), and if you do not walk away from this film with the proper sense of loathing for yourself, your family, everyone you know, and every human being who has ever been born or will ever be born (except for James Cameron), then you are obviously a selfish wastrel bastard who hates lovely blue kitty-cat aliens, actual kittens, and the universe itself.",negative
649,"James Cameron's 'Avatar' is 100% a masterpiece. It is by far the most impressive film ever made in the visual department. it took a lot of efforts and years of waiting to come up with such an advanced CGI effects and motion captures. to this day, 7 years after avatar was released, i haven't seen even one movie that can be compared with avatar's visually beauties. No, Avatar doesn't resemble Pocahontas in any way. It doesn't have any direct connection to other films. It is an original story, which is refreshing since most of the new movies are based upon or rebooting something else. James Cameron made the two most financially successful movies of all time - 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', and it's not a coincidence. This guy is a real genius! I recommend Avatar to ANYONE who appreciate the art of films and the fact that a movie is not perfect without it's beauties and visual factors. 10 out of 10. an unworldly masterclass!",positive
650,"The brilliant film ""Avatar"" directed by James Cameron turned out to have a very deep subtext. But this subtext is the most important thing. While the audience is worried about the main characters, gradually becoming on the side of the Na'vi civilization, the main idea of the brilliant director and screenwriter is in the background. And it is quite simple - modern civilization lives in an absolutely wrong paradigm of development, in which the dominant idea is personal immeasurable enrichment due to the robbery of the majority by a parasitic minority.It looks simpler on a computer, but the movie was made so that we could enjoy it in 3D on a huge screen. Because of this, some people dislike ""Avatar"", since they watched it only from a computer. These people have lost a lot. Personally, my opinion is that the film deserves the highest rating! This is 10 out of 10, and it's pointless to argue with it.",positive
651,"Sadly, I needed to watch it in 2D, however even with that, this film was simply splendid. I think we as a whole know the fundamental framework of the story at this point, and I concede, a portion of the film's blemishes is that the plot is to some degree unsurprising, and that it had some banality minutes and some messy discourse, however all things considered, I thought the film was generally speaking fabulous. We as a whole realize the SFX are the best ever, however what you cannot deny is that the manner in which the film is executed really conveys a serious passionate punch that the vast majority won't expect, and the entirety of the exhibitions generally speaking are extraordinary, even Worthington's, yet I can without much of a stretch say that Zoe Saldaña was the best one, which carries me to my next point, and what I believe is the feature of the film.
In the event that you thought Gollum in the LotR films or the prawns in Region 9 were amazing in how much feeling and authenticity they passed on, just you hold up 'till you see this current film's blue humanoids. They're, without a sorry excuse for an uncertainty, the most attractive CG characters I've ever observed. In addition to the fact that they look genuine, they FELT genuine, and following a couple of moments in, one could undoubtedly overlook they were all entertainers moving catch suits. The na'vi indicated more feeling, more articulation and essentially simply more life than what most true to life entertainers have today. I trust the Institute Grants consider movement catch exhibitions starting now and into the foreseeable future in the Acting classes, since they were only exceptional in this film, and route better than most true to life exhibitions we get today. What's more, the activity, obviously, was additionally fabulous. Cameron simply demonstrated to individuals like Michael Inlet that the Lord is back. The fight scenes, yet even a few sections that were simply, state, a few characters flying around on their banshees were only a delight to take a gander at, since all shots simply show how astonishing the extraordinarily profound and definite world that Pandora is. To the faculties, it's the most dazzling film I've ever observed. With respect to story and discourse composing, it could've been something more, it's not great, however this current film's truly about how the story is executed instead of the substance.
Another feature for me is, obviously, exactly how profound and point by point everything in this film was, and being a craftsman myself, you could without much of a stretch envision exactly what an attack on the faculties it was for me to observe such a perfectly made world that is Pandora. Going from its verdure to its fauna, everything in this world are in fact outsider, yet additionally have a natural sense to them from our reality. One who's been viewing Cameron for as far back as hardly any years would realize that he's constantly been into profound submerged investigation, and you can undoubtedly tell that a great deal of what he saw down there impacted his vision for a large number of the things we find in this lavish magnificence of an ever-extending rainforest.
Concerning the film's score, I truly don't get why a few people are getting disturbed about it. As I would see it, James Horner gave us an enormous score that fit consummately to whatever was going on during the film. Furthermore, indeed, I even like Leona Lewis' melody in the end credits.
Numerous movie producers out there consider CG impacts and put no profundity into the account or story, yet that is not the situation with Cameron. In this film, the embellishments made the story. He places embellishments and story in a blender, and lattices these components up so well that what we get is one of the most exceptional movies ever.",positive
652,"An amazing movie.Enriching and metaphorically relevant premise, beautifully displayed.",positive
653,"The special effects, 3d and animation in Avatar are worth the price of admission alone, simply jaw dropping. This movie is not to be missed if you want to see state of the art effects. I totally enjoyed the 3d aspects of the movie, but the all to boring and familiar battle scene finale left me disappointed. I thought it was so ironic that Sigourney Weaver starred in this movie and over 20 years ago was in Alien, with a very similar movie ending. The same old same old battle with a human in a robotic machine. Same as in one of the Matrix movies. Come on, think of something better! The characters in my opinion also lacked depth. There was real potential in this movie but the emphasis was on visuals and not character development and a decent story- line. This plot was lame. I so wanted to like this movie, but I came away disappointed. I'm so over these tiresome and repetitious battle sequences.",positive
654,"As much as I don't agree with all of director James Cameron's ideologies, I do respect him as a filmmaker and a storyteller. For better evidence, I looked into his grand epic, Avatar. Released in 2009, it brought innovative visions in CGI, motion capture, and 3D. With a total of $760 million in the US, and over $2 billion worldwide, Avatar sits on top as the highest-grossing movie of all-time. Interestingly enough, the last movie to hold that honor was James Cameron's last prior release, Titanic.A lot of movies come with the 3-act structure. With a running time of 2 hours and 41 minutes, I assessed the plot of Avatar by dividing it into 4 even quarters. The first quarter is where Jake Sully becomes an operator of a Na'vi-human hybrid, or an avatar, as part of the Avatar Program over at an RDA camp on Pandora. Jake enters his avatar form by going to sleep. It's slow-moving at first, but as Jake's avatar stumbles upon a tribe of Na'vi, the second quarter kicks off. At that point, the plot begins to build up as we are introduced to this unique species that it centers around. Jake and his crew begin to delve further into the Na'vi, as his avatar becomes one of them and even gets initiated into the tribe. Here, we see how the Na'vi live, survive, and act. It even leaves an impact on Jake as he resists Colonel Miles Quaritch's orders to make the Na'vi abandon their home. The third quarter kicks off when Quaritch leads an attack on the Na'vi and their home. This is where the conflict comes in to interfere with our characters and the Na'vi's trust with Jake is tested. Finally, the fourth quarter is where the battle between the Na'vi and the RDA takes place and brings our movie to an exciting climax and eventual resolution.Together, these four quarters present an engaging story that builds up at every moment. Avatar finds James Cameron changing the game of filmmaking. It justifies his place as one of the best in original storytelling, as he invents a new species, a new location, a new language, and basically, a new culture. It's not only original in storytelling, but also in visual effects and cinematography. Avatar tells a story about a new world, and it tells us how James Cameron became the king of the world, twice.Score: 92/100Recommendation: Anyone",positive
655,"Avatar keeps you waiting for marvelous images to emerge from the screen. That's the main reason why this ultra-linear/flat 2h40 story would make an interesting show. Every spectator wants to be surprised, so the National Geographic/Pandora Discovery Channel first part is enough to make us wait and watch through child's eyes.Then the story is mainly against militarism, imperialism and about people living in harmony with their likes and the Nature. So it's not the usual heavy-handed big brawn and dull apocalyptic show of über-blockbusters. Nevertheless go find one interesting character in Avatar. To me, Neytiri is the most interesting, yet she's only the CGI rendition of a real actress (Zoe Saldana)! On the other hand Sam Worthington's avatar looks bland. In fact the whole main character is bland, passive and one-dimensional. Funnily enough Sam Worthington's character in Terminator: Salvation, very close to Jake Sully in terms of storyline, is a much deeper character...Thus there are reasons to be disappointed by Avatar if you were expecting a groundbreaking masterpiece. Seeing it in 3D is an important experience for whoever is interested in movies and new technologies; the experience ranges from nice to very nice provided you can appreciate all the good work and stop short of being addicted to the images.Simply put you can't fall for Avatar because its storyline is just too linear and its characters also just too one-dimensional. It took 12 years for James Cameron to be able to make Avatar and he wasn't able to write something better? More accurately, since he is not renown for his perfectly and subtly crafted screenplays I'd say he missed the opportunity to team up with some good writer(s). Cameron has reached such a status it's difficult for him to collaborate in a creative department he thinks he masters and thus the real joy for him must have been the creative collaboration on the technically challenging parts. As a result he put more energy in the visual creation of Avatar, not in the writing. Another very weak point is the score by James Horner: 12 years after Titanic he couldn't come up with something better that doesn't constantly brings memory of his previous score for Cameron. I suppose this shows just how much James Cameron was unable to provide the necessary amount of energy to the creative departments other than visual imagery.Now, about the visual imagery, it's nice but only a rehash of Miyazaki's visual and poetic creations: Princess Mononoke (mainly), Nausicaä, Castle in the sky. Cameron didn't improve at all on these references.Conclusion: I'll not go and watch Avatar again. There's nothing interesting beyond the 3D experience so I suspect it must be far less interesting, even boring, to watch in 2D.",neutral
656,"This movie is just a perfect picture from start to finish, I'm a massive fan of original movies and this was something new and different. Great characters and a great story to go with it. Looking forward to see if 2,3,4 and 5 will ever come out.",positive
657,"Special Effects / Artistry - 10/10 Acting - 9/10 Script - 5/10 Story - 6/10 Score - 7/10 Foley - 10/10As a creative and technical achievement, this movie is the new benchmark of special effects and immersion. The story is simplistic, and often predictable, serving as a plot device to take you on a ride so the fantastical world of Avatar can be shown off. For the first time, the CGI organic elements - creatures, plants, Na'vi, humans - look better than the mechanical elements. The movements, inflections, detail, and sounds infuse these alien lifeforms with life.However, without the 'wow' factor of special effects, it would not be a great film as the story on its own is simplistic if not cliché.Of James Cameron's films, I would still say that 'Aliens' is my favorite. A darker, but still iconic film, its 'Na'vi' not so sympathetic. We are moving towards a future world where dreams are turned into visceral reality. After watching this film, you will understand what it is like to leave your Avatar.",positive
658,"Goodness me! Once again James Cameron takes mediocrity to new heights. He places the mediocrity in a box made of gold and elevates the box onto a platform with spotlights pointing at it. Goodness me! He destroyed the Alien franchise with his trashy and brash sequel and then he turned a real sea tragedy into a cliché ridden, money spinning bore fest(Titanic). Goodness me! It seems that any project with his name attached is bound for sure fire success because it's James 'Goodness Me' Cameron and we must, by law, consider his works genius. (Goodness me).Avatar is a computer game. Nothing more. I want to see a MOVIE when I go to the cinema, thank you very much and a big Goodness Me!I shall now declare a national holiday. I shall call it 'Goodness Me Day' in honour of James Cameron.",negative

660,"To be honest, I'm even afraid to analyze the film - I wouldn't want to destroy the wonderful state of mind into which it brought me.A really wonderful movie.The director coped with the most difficult task - how not to drown the viewer in the ocean of special effects, but to make him feel, immerse himself in the atmosphere of the film and begin to deeply empathize with the characters (almost the entire hall, consisting of a completely different, heterogeneous audience, applauded).There are really a lot of special effects, but at the same time, not only the quantitative, but also the qualitative boundary has been overcome, when they do not look like something inappropriate, made as a simple tribute to fashion. Rather, it is better to use not even the word special effect, but just an artistic technique. The film is incredibly beautiful, you get aesthetic pleasure from every minute.The plot is a vivid example of how you can make an eternal story out of a fairly old story! The struggle between civilization and nature in this form is much more convincing than, for example, in 2012, although I can't say exactly why yet, apparently the real talent of the director consists in such elusive things.The love line is simply charming, I believe unequivocally. You look at the characters and sincerely imbued with the purity of their feelings, you want to be similar, even if not blue.",positive
661,"I must admit the film had me at the very beginning, when a paraplegic says that he loves to dream because dreams make running and walking possible, my head keeps nodding as if it was mounted on springs. And the emotional outcome of that moment occurs when the Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) wakes up in his avatar's new skin and doesn't feel any weirdness, he's just so happy he starts to run as if he was in a dream, as if nothing mattered anymore, not even the mission. I loved that moment because it felt surreal yet so real, Sully wouldn't have cared about looking like Jar-Jar Binks if it made him feel his toes again. Youssa better believe it.And this might be Cameron's way to tell us that even something as big as ""Avatar"" started as a tiny dream, and the first images with the hybrid Na'vis might have inspired him the same eccstatic reaction than Sully, his babies were alive, in synthetic images but alive nonetheless! Now, maybe it's because ""Avatar"" involves a giant alien species but the film is so cinematically ""big"" that it doesn't just dwarf other movies, it dwarfs any attempt to criticize it on the sole basis that the plot carries many déjà vu feelings. You see me coming, but come on, who the hell am I to say, this movie is a retread of ""Pocahontas"", ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Princess Mono-noke""? James Cameron himself admitted to have made the story out of several inspiration and that included his childhood books and his mothers' dreams. Was ""Titanic"" any more original? Yet it made Cameron the king of the world. ""Avatar"" turned him into an undisputed Emperor and the film was so unique, inventive in the concept and innovative in the treatment that it flies over the critic.That's not to say you can't criticize it but the amount of things worthy of praise is so overwhelming critics would be like complaining that the Sphinx misses a nose. So I guess I'd feel better if I gave ""Avatar"" ten points already and then talk about the eventual little things that-could-have-been-better. So let's goI still remember how big ""Avatar"" was in 2009, the last film to be as big without belonging to the ""Star Wars"" franchise was ""Titanic"" so since this was from the same director, people knew they were going to be blown away before swallowing the first popcorn. And they were. Yes the film is marvelously looking but it's CGI. I loved it as far as I can appreciate a good Pixar movie but reading Roger Ebert's reviews, I felt like he loved the film on the sole basis that it created a whole new world, and that it didn't matter that the film didn't break any narrative ground.Now, does it matter? Not really, I also praised ""Titanic"" while it wasn't the most original story ever, but it had characters I cared for, and worthy antagonists. There was a moment in ""Avatar"" where the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver was describing the power of trees, the way they use their roots as a synapses and so on (which can be a rationalization for the trees' magical power in ""Pocahontas""). This part had me intrigued and involved but then Ribisi's character had to ruin it by saying ""there are just goddamn trees"". I was baffled by his lack of empathy, it's just as if they wanted to supply his mouth with some villain's dialogue and the same awkward attempts were made with the Captain of the mission played by Stephen Lang.Basically, you have the good natives, who behave exactly like extra-terrestrial natives and you have the good and the bad white and in the role of Lieutenant John Smith Dunbar, there's Worthington. The film recycled so many plots elements that it's difficult to disconnect your cliché-radar. But if the radar doesn't work, how about forgetting about the story and listening to the dialogue, the new language Cameron invented by pulling a Tolkien, watching the little details in the scenery, yes, yes CGI, but what CGI! We're not talking about any computer imagery, this is a vision that kept on Cameron's mind since before ""Titanic"" and he waited for the technological advances to make them possible. Even the king of the world was disarmed but he wisely waited for the right time and it became the highest-grossing film of all time. Any good team of computer programmers could have done it, the film is a feast to the eyes, it's a deep story, but I was reminded that there were more than special effects to make a film, ""Avatar"" might not be a triumph of storytelling but it doesn't have a bad story to tell, its environmentalist issues, the way they foreshadow our future needs, echo some masterpieces from Miyazaki. In fact, I kept thinking of Mono-noke while watching the film, now is the film less worthy of praise because one was drawn? Let's say I prefer the way there's no villains in ""Mono-noke"" but to Cameron's defense, the film couldn't have had another third act. And let's acknowledge the creative force behind the very concept of the avatar and the beauty of the Na'vis; Cameron created a world, a myth, he stole George Lucas' thunder and proved that cinema wouldn't just rely on ""Star Wars"" and then on comic-book movies. The man had guts, vision and the guts to follow his vision and he also had the dough. You refuse nothing to the king of the world, but if all it took to make great movies was money, blockbusters would never flop. ""Avatar"" was deemed to succeed, because it was a game changer. And as far as critics go, the game is over.",positive
662,"I can not wait for part two, this movie is brilliant!",positive
663,"Bit of a mixed experience for me, to be honest. As others have remarked, the CGI from WETA is simply the best seen so far with the 3D aspect literally adding another dimension to the whole experience. I found the forest foliage in particular to be lush, beautifully lit and sufficiently different to be other-worldly without seeming unnatural (although I smiled when I saw the New Zealanders had managed to sneak in an emblematic Koru or two).This is just as well because the story itself is a pretty shallow and occasionally patronising affair, rehashing somewhat clichéd themes of abuse of indigenous people and ecology seen previously in the likes of ""On Deadly Ground"", ""Medicine Man"" and ""Dances with Wolves"". Other key elements of the film seem to have direct parallels in other work such as the Pandoran wildlife scenes (Jurassic Park), riders on winged beasts (Lord of the Rings), sky-diving sans parachute off sundry platforms (Die Hard), Hi-tech army vs Low-tech army (Star Wars), robotic exoskeletons (Aliens), flotillas of attack ""helicopters"" (Apocalypse Now), floating mountains (Roger Dean's Yes album artwork) etc. Unfortunately, this mish-mash doesn't make for a particularly good Science-Fiction film since fans of the genre tend to be critical thinkers and hence expect originality and plausible scientific (and supporting economic) aspects to a story.So is ""Avatar"" reduced to being just another action pot-boiler albeit transposed into an alien setting? If it were judged on the merits of the story alone, then the answer is yes. However, the visuals are so rich and immersive that you can almost smell the forest around you. Because of this, you find that you unconsciously forgive the numerous flaws in the storyline and just revel in the beauty of it. It's ironic though that James Cameron claims to have waited 10 years until technology caught up to bring his story to the screen when it's so clearly the technology that props it all up.",positive

665,"Cameron has directed some pretty stellar movies over his career. From Terminator to Alien to Titanic, he really hasn't made a bad movie. But after Titanic he spent the last decade making and trying to build up his new movie which he dubs ""will change film making."" If he was intending on changing film making in the way that 3D glasses will be more acceptable in movies then he succeeded. If he was intending on creating new character archetypes and changing the way storytelling is done then he didn't. But despite the obvious ""Dances with Smurfs"" joke that everyone and their mother has already mentioned, the movie is pretty damn impressive. Sure it doesn't have the most original story but the execution is really well done. For me this is really the first 3D movie that succeeds mainly because it doesn't feel like a gimmick is being forced on you. It's simply there to give you a more realistic feel and its easily the best looking movie of the year. Cameron's obvious strengths are in directing action sequences and this is easily seen in the final 40 minutes of the movie. As for the acting he did a pretty good job there too. Zoe Saldana is the star of the show and was obviously wasted in Star Trek. All the other actors are maybe a little above average and they advance the story very well. On the script level, the film feels a bit clunky at points. Most notably is in the opening 20 minutes of the film where everything feels rushed. It jumps almost immediately into the story instead of easing us in. Also the last 40 minutes of the movie which is just a big action movie essentially, the script also feels dumbed down a bit. But despite this problem the script works more often then it doesn't.As for the characters, although most of the acting is good, the characters are very two- dimensional. They're characters you seen in other movies before and nothing new is added to them. But the movie is really plot driven or character driven so it is easily overlooked.Really this movie is all about the visuals and more importantly the 3D. I have had a really bad hatred for 3D in the past so when Cameron pulled this off by creating a subtle effect, it proved that 3D can work for a movie, even though the movie doesn't actually need it. But it's proof that it doesn't need to be shoved in your face. All the colours and effects of the movie make it feel more like a roller coaster. I won't spend to much on the story other than saying while not original or extremely deep, it is very well told and keeps the movie going.So is it worth it? Don't go in expecting the most intelligent film of the year but you should expect the best looking one. Technologically Cameron did succeed on making his movie, changing cinema technically and even if it is slightly empty in the middle it is one hell of a good time at the movies. Especially in 3D.",neutral
666,"This film was a true epic of its time. It is definitely not very original in its storyline but it was so well executed that I was engrossed all the way through, emotionally enraptured and always rooting for the characters. Other than the beginning, you never notice how much time has passed. It is visually wonderful although it relies on this a bit too much at the expense of the story. The storyline and characters are a bit clichéd but it was just so engaging I didn't care.",positive
667,"I was very hyped for the opening of Avatar, expecting a high caliber movie. As an avid follower of 3d titles I was especially looking forward to this movie. In short I thought the creativity in making Pandora come to life breathtaking but found the story full of Cliché.To me it was evident that Cameron had all the new tools of the trade to make Avatar, but just because a director has all the tools to envision a story does not mean he should. Am I saying Avatar should not have been made? No. But what I was surprised about Avatar was the extensive creative work put into a story that seemed to lack any kind of heart and had little character development. Why was the head of security a complete psycho with a destructive bent? Why did the company mining in a far off galaxy lack any kind of human ethic? Why would the military be a part of this operation? I could go on and on.The 3d part of the movie was OK at best. I feel that movies that are going to utilize 3d should really use that aspect to ""immerse the audience"" by exploiting the 3d technology. With Avatar there were moments where I felt like the experience would have been the same with or without 3d. The depth to the 3d was shallow and not very intense.Without being too critical I will finish by saying that I was entertained, and that's what I payed for with Avatar. Was my mind or heart provoked much? Not really. I would see this one at the theater but not own it in my personnel collection.",neutral
668,"I hated this movie.Hated it, hated it, hated it.Don't get me wrong, I'm not shoving my opinion down your throats or anything – the great thing about movies is that they're debatable. The problem with Avatar, however, is that James Cameron doesn't want it to be debatable. He wants you to love it – he'd be downright insulted if you didn't like it. Everybody's going to love it because it has everything that makes a movie great – characters, action, and groundbreaking special effects. Whoever doesn't like it is obviously missing something.Bullshit.For one thing, it's pretentious – not just pretentious, but also incredibly preachy. James Cameron may have a great visual style but he's easily one of the worst directors – if not one of the worst creative entities in the world – when it comes to moralizing in his films. The story was nothing more than a recycled cowboys vs. Indians melodrama in a shallow point to prove that, ""humanity is evil, oh my god!"" It was pretty much the equivalent of being locked in a room for two and a half hours and having one of your school's environmental awareness club scream at you with stunning special effects. Yeah alright Hollywood, we get it already. Humanity is evil; we get how heartless we are as a human race and how you expect us to shed a tear as we watch our military knock down that giant tree they have at Disney's Animal Kingdom. By the way, is it bad that I rooted for the humans? Not because I'm a conservative, cold-heard violent warmonger or anything, but just for how preachy Cameron was in showing us the lifestyle of the inhabitants of Pandora. Seriously, I can picture him right now laughing at the thought of his moviegoers walking out of the theatre, invigorated and awed like they just saw a groundbreaking experience that changed their mundane, unfulfilling lives. James Cameron said Avatar would push cinema the same way, ""The Jazz Singer"" – the first talkie that came out in the 1920's – did. What Cameron fails to realize however is that you don't need all of these flashy gimmicks to reel people movies like fish. If you can see a movie and you can hear a movie, what else do you need? Vibrators built into our chair so he can jerk his audience off in the comfort of their seats? He's already jerked Hollywood off enough by getting them to financing this piece of crap so I guess it's a fair trade when you look at it. At the rate enhancing the film experience is going, the sequel will consist of nothing more than painting moviegoers blue and letting them loose in the woods behind the theatre.And then there's the fact of the storyline – god, I think this brought cliché to a new level. We're introduced first to Jake Sully, a rough and tough marine who – from the moment we see him – is obviously going to not only be the one to win the heart of the girl but also turn against his people. Ne'ytri (I probably spelled her name wrong but she was a terrible character anyway) was nothing more than a spiritual guru plot device to get the main character to see the light. ""Oh god, look at what I was missing out on! Nature is so beautiful! Look at the colors of the wind!"" Their relationship was so tacky you could have slapped it on a Hallmark Valentines Day card. ""Alright class, the alien and the boy don't really get along at first. What happens?"" ""They end up liking each other!"" ""Oh, that's great – just excellent! And then what happens?"" ""She ends up saving him and they get married!"" ""Oh, how wonderful. Maybe you should be a director someday, James! Then there's the archetypal marine antagonists who want to destroy this perfect little utopia because, well, they're just greedy douche bags apparently and that's one of the main flaws with this movie. Characters are either good or bad – they're not developed, they don't grow, they're just kind of cemented there and told to look pretty. Quarich is one of them. He's a bad guy – nothing more. That's not necessarily a bad thing when a movie doesn't take itself seriously, but if you're going to ask me to get into a theatre for two and a half hours to watch your pretentious public service announcement of a film, I kind of want to know where this guy's coming from. All we really get from him is that he's mad with power and wants the, ""unobtanium."" Yes, that's actually what's it's called. Along with being a Hollywood cash hound, Cameron also thinks he's witty. Bottom line though, I go to movies to see stories and characters. I'm not saying it's the right way to look at things – there's tons of films that are just mindless popcorn fests – but if you're going to try to take yourself seriously, well, at least try to do a little with the characters in between the gratuitous shots of aliens sticking their tentacles into dragons. By the way, if that's also the way they sexually reproduce then isn't that technically bestiality? And damn, is it really that hard to kill someone? Even if he was in a flashy robot suit, that guy Quartich was like a cockroach at the end. He would have given Gaston from Beauty and The Beast a run for his money with the way he was fighting that battle. Or more suitably, Radcliffe from Pocahontas.I'm suddenly tempted to watch that final fight scene again with that song, ""Savages,"" playing.So what is it? An debatable movie? An over-hyped movie? Not sure, but it made me want to boycott that new Smurfs movie they're advertising.",negative

671,"Avatar had a lot of potential to be amazing. It is still very good, but many argue against it since it ripped off Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves. Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don't complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue and plot points are terrible, but shut your brain off and it's a fun experience.Let's look at the world of Avatar. It's a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.Disregarding the elaborate world-building involved in this film, the movie is filled with clichés, cheesy dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. Let's look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na'vi since they're ""savages"" (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver's character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn't consult many co-writers.What this movie lacks for in quality of writing, however, it makes up with heart. The ideals the Na'vi strive for seem like they have been forgotten in the real world today, and they are what draw us and Sully to them as a community. We cheer for Sully and the Na'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?Avatar is good; it cannot be labeled terrible simply because it takes plot points from Dances With Wolves, but it does lack quality based on its disregard for good dialogue and some underdeveloped characters.3.0/4.0",positive
672,"Movies are escapism. They take us to other worlds, based in our reality or not, and tell us stories. These stories either reflect the best or worst of our natures, our dreams and nightmares, and communicate these themes on multiple levels. It has been said of many movies that 'it takes you to another world/place/time'. Only with ""Avatar"" is this true.There's not much to say about the movie that watching the film won't say for itself, so it's pointless to try and communicate that here. Instead, I want to focus on the experience. I watched 'Avatar' on IMAX-3D and, despite not seeing it in any other format, can confidently say this is the ONLY way to see it. At the end of the movie, I didn't want it to be over. I wanted to stay in Pandora. Never has a movie had an effect on me like this. I was literally, in every sense of the word, transported to another world, another time. To say the visuals are stunning and breathtaking are paltry adjectives for such eloquent film making.Many people have and will degrade the movie for it's 'lack of an original story'. What they don't understand is that this is not an 'American' movie, if you will. The film's story is taken from legend, legend that a thousand cultures across the planet share, and roots it firmly and beautifully in another world. It's characters and mythology are anchored in the human subconscious, which allows the audiences to fully embrace this new world Cameron has shown us.It's one of the highlight movie experiences of my life and it is my hope it will be for you. As has been said of other James Cameron movies: he doesn't reinvent the wheel, he just shows it rolling in a whole new way. There are a thousand positive things to be said about 'Avatar' but the only one that deserves mention is this: see it the way it is intended to be seen, or miss out on the cinematic opportunity of a lifetime.",positive
673,"It's a tremendous achievement of film-making, but it's not the second coming as has been widely rumored. Things I liked: incredible imagery, awesome 3D, excellent acting, a simple well-executed story, characters that we care about (even the aliens), action drama romance--the works. Things I didn't like: I hate it when I see movies which glorify ""indigenous peoples"" and act as though our modern day culture has nothing to offer. I think it's too simple minded, and offensive to both sides of the coin. I'm insulted because there's a lot of good things about the culture of the developed world, and there are good things about the undeveloped world--or primitive worlds of the past. However, to paint the Na'vi as a people who're totally happy, need nothing, have everything...who seem, somehow, to have the perfect life living the primitive life they do...it's irritating. It takes greater skill as a writer and director to paint both sides in an accurate way: both sides having good and bad traits (as is realistic), both sides having good and bad individuals. Instead, here we have the Na'vi as ALL good, the scientists ALL good, and the corporate folks all bad. Retarted. Additionally, I felt like the anti-corporate slant was a little tired. It just pandered overtly to the recent anti-""fat cats on Wall Street"" and sense of resentment about those unidentified rich people who started the recession. Lame. Grow up. We're such a society of self-loathing, self-hating people who resent it when others make more than we do, always wishing to be like those societies of old who mythically had the perfect life...and this movie seemed to be attempting to tap into that self-hatred. Anyway, masterful film-making with that last exception.",positive
674,"Having just returned from the theater, we are just positively stunned by what we have just witnessed. Avatar is a grand and glorious adventure, breaking new ground in many segments of the movie-going experience. It's 3-D adaptation was seamless and flawless, adding great depth and feel to all aspects of the film. Just walking through the jungle became a wonder, with seemingly touchable grasses, insects flitting and grand inner depths to the longer shots. The world itself was an ingenious revelation, alight with creatures and plants and, yes, humanoids, fresh from Cameron's imagination. Luminescence is everywhere, from the ground moss to floating jelly-fish-like floating seedpods, to spiral plants and the most ethereal of glowing willows. Cameron's animals were crafted with skill and grand vigor, especially his hammer-headed rhino-like beast, wee feral-like out-world dogs, giant cats merged with beetles on steroids, and our favorites, the winged dragon-like beasties ridden by the hero and heroine alike. The story-line echoed any number of struggles between indigenous populations and invading ones (American Indian vs. settler/Gov't; Irish/Scottish/Welsh/South African/Indian/etc. versus British Empire; Mayan/Inca versus Spanish dominance) but told in a new-twist manner, with a backdrop of nicely developed characters and intricate world one comes to care about. I did not read any reviews before seeing the movie, not wanting to color my feelings. After reading a smattering upon our arrival back home, I see the vast majority are positive or more so, with just a few in the negative range. I applaud those who saw this ground-breaker for what it is -- and wonder what need be produced on the big-screen to better please those who could not find outright wonders in this creatively stunning film. See it at your single screen, the local multi-plex ... on IMAX ... but SEE IT at all costs!",positive
675,"You can really see where the $250,000,000 went. There's color and texture through every inch of the screen. And like every James Cameron film there is no expense spared on live sets. He really knows how to fill up a sound stage.The story is really something to behold. A paralyzed soldier is recruited to pick up where his brother leaves off and gets new legs in the form of his avatar, a tribal, jungle dweller sent to stake out the traditions of a people for the purpose of reporting back their weaknesses so that they can be forced to move in order to obtain the rich natural resources that exists under their Lifetree, the source of their heritage and oneness.When he falls in love with one of the female villagers and with the way of life of the peaceful, naturebound ""People"" he entertains second thoughts.One can imagine the results. He's forced to make a decision. One to do what is right and protect a people susceptible to the strengths and ruthlessness of a greedy corporation, or back the plan of the Marines to remove or even eliminate the people for financial gain.One cannot help but to draw comparisons between what we see on the screen (filmed during the Bush administration) and our presence in the Middle East and the American greed for oil.The results are horrific. The ruthlessness is horrific to say the least. It is somewhat manipulative, and one can see clearly James Cameron's political bent. He paints the Marines as evil and willing to destroy the people with no more conscience than one would wipe out an ant hill.The People fight back, with the help of the protagonist and a few Human friends and score some very deadly blows against the ""evil"" Marines.I have never liked seeing American troops being killed, even when they're portrayed as being bad. I think the first, and maybe only time I've seen this is in the kid's movie, ""Small Soldiers"" and even then they were toys and not people.The best message that the movie delivers is the need to respect not only the cultures of others regardless of our potential richening, but that the Earth is not merely a resource by which we satisfy our greedy desires but that we can live amongst nature and with it and cooperate with it, thereby being mutually benefited.The message is a little heavy handed at times, and it can be a little distracting, but the beauty of the film's art is awe inspiring and James Camercon's love of detail takes one's breath away.To see Sigourney Weaver do what she does, even at 61, is wonderful. Is another Ripley vehicle in store? We shall see.8 out of 10.",neutral
676,"did all reviewers here really watch the same movie as i did? well maybe because i didn't watch it in 3d...but seriously this movie does never ever deserve to be in the top 250...best rating you can give it is mediocre yes the cgi are nice and some of the pictures are really great and beautiful - the film might set a new standard here (altough some of the movements from the cgi characters, especially the navi still don't look realistic and sloppy) BUT thats pretty much there is to that movie...the story/plot (if you could even call it so) is dumb, unbelievable and 1:1 copy paste from a lots of other movies that went the exact same path like who dances with wolfs (and did a much better job) - after 10 minutes of the movie i could already EXACTLY predict what would happen and how it would happen - plain boring the characters are absolutely flat, unbelievable and stereotype and you feel no empathy or sympathy for any of them - the main character sully is completely unbelievable and dumb - the other characters are so stereotype that a 10 year old could have come up with them - you got the mad army chief, the jealous rival, the love which looses trust in you and then gains it back..i mean come on - seriously??? what annoyed me the most - if you base your movie solely on pretty pictures then these need to blow me away - this simply didn't happen, one reason for this is also the lack of fantasy in the movies...James Cameron simply lacks the imagination to really create a fantastic movie such as Jim Burton for example can - let me explain the planet of Pandora is fantastic - but its exactly that kind of fantastic 99% of the people between 5 and 90 could have come up with... simply look at all the ""alien creatures"" - you simply take any earth jungle inhabitant, add some tentacles, change the colour voilà - alien creature...oh dear - if i watch a 500 mio ""fantastic"" movie i am excepting to be blown a way with stuff i could never imagine myself, but Pandora and its inhabitants looks like something you can come up with if someone asked you to describe an alien world in 30 seconds i am disappointed and i don't think this movie deserves all the credits it gets, especially taking into account the huge cost",neutral
677,"Few movies deserve to be long. This is one of them. At no point during the picture do we feel it's dragging too slowly, nor do we ever feel like the script has been ""dumbed down"" for us. There is minimal set up and the plot gets rolling along as soon as the opening title emerges. Sam Worthington's voice-over provides us with just the enough back story while also setting the mood. He plays his character as a young, brave, but ultimately innocent, service member. His persona echos that of many enlisted servicemen who joined up after seeing a ""Be all you can be"" commercial. He has little, if any, hindsight. Armed only with courage, we witness him make calculated errors. But he has faith in himself and we sympathize with him because he's so vulnerable. Yes, this is a big budget Hollywood movie. Yes, it has many clichéd and unoriginal plot elements. Yet it is unusually well focused, and it embodies the same spirit as any character driven independent feature film. And it does so very well. This is a movie which doesn't rely on A-lister movie stars because Cameron understands that movie stars and money don't constitute a great film. Cameron uses his cast, crew, and every available technology much like the great Leonardos and Donatellos used their paint brushes. Personally, I dislike going to movie theaters. I usually wait for the DVD. But this was too good to pass up as there are no other James Camerons out there. I dread the day he'll retire. He makes action sequences like no other. In most pictures, my mind goes numb once the fireballs and bullets start flying. But not this time. Cameron understands the importance of letting the audience emotionally invest in the protagonists, mean while comprehending the threat which the antagonists pose. I found myself relating to the Worthington character which made the theatrical viewing more of a genuine experience and not just three hours of ""entertainment."" Avatar is such a cinematic treat much like Terminator 2 and Titanic in that it overwhelms our senses. It would be a shame for anyone who claims to appreciate the motion picture to ignore this one.",positive
678,"It's a beautiful film, no one is going to argue with that. The milieu is stunningly and originally imagined - not just the incredible beauty of the planet itself, but of the futuristic technology as well...That said, if you've seen Dances With Wolves? You've seen Avatar. Let's see.. injured and war-weary soldier? Check. Ends up alone on the frontier? Check. Gets friendly with the natives? Check. Goes native against his own people? Check. There's just nothing there that's surprising, and even the Navi culture is clearly and directly inspired by Native American cultures. So on that front, it's a little insulting to the audience's intelligence.However, it's so well-executed that I'm persuaded to forgive the sin of it's derivative nature and just sit back and enjoy it.",positive
679,"Avatar is a movie you can describe in a short list: - pretty - terribly old and dated story - leaning too heavily on technology - predictableI can see this movie enthralling 8 year olds since the story is probably still cool to them but to for me? It was so painfully predictable, it became annoying to watch. Sure, there's quite a few great movies with predictable plots but Avatar's ONLY other strong point is the 3D and, frankly, colourful plants and stuff stopped being fascinating to me since I was 12. Being a gamer, I've seen far more interesting digital worlds. For all the effort put into it, it came across as a fake cartoon world instead of a real threatening one. Making everything look as if it jumped out of a Pixar movie doesn't help either.In the end, it's a gimmicky movie with nice 3D, a terrible story and mediocre acting. 8+/10 people? Did you see the same movie I did?",negative

681,"I watched this film awhile back in December. Before watching it, my brother told me (even though he hasn't seen the movie yet) that it was going to be bad. When I watched the trailer, I wasn't really captivated by it. I originally thought it was only a bunch of CGI's and no heart in the movie. After watching it, I was totally surprised.This movie is a feast to the human eyes. There are things in the movie that you haven't seen before in your life. It's probably the most beautiful movie you will ever see. The visuals are great; it's like you are actually part of the Avatar world. Aside from the visuals, there's a heart in this movie. You can relate to the characters the pain, the love, and the suffering they're experiencing the plot even though most of the characters are motion-captured! James Cameron, not only gives us a beautiful movie but a beautiful experience as well. It feels like being a kid again. This movie will go into the classics and the best film-making as one of the most beautiful film ever made. A must see in IMAX 3D but even without that, the journey never loses its excitement! Go watch Avatar and feast your eyes with delight! 10/10",positive
682,"The only reason I gave this movie a 10 is that IMDb hasn't implemented 15's as a score yet. It is simply incredible.There are a few naysayers who have complained about the plot of the movie. My only explanation is that they are just too stupid to appreciate what they just saw. The plot has everything you could ask for, and is very different from anything you've ever seen in a major motion picture. This movie could play without the soundtrack and the story would still be compelling.However, the home run hit by this movie is unquestionably the special effects. Again, maybe some kids that have grown up in the 'great special effects generation' aren't able to to really watch what is going on and truly appreciate the achievement. In the car driving home, I commented that I was surprised I was actually getting us home ... the entire time images from the movie were still racing thru my head. This movie is just truly a feast in every way. From the opening shot to the last the visuals are the most incredible I've ever seen in any media. To hearken back to the famous ""Superman"" advertising ... You WILL believe a 10 foot alien man can fly on a wyvern-like alien beast!""It all looks real, from the stunning alien world to the action scenes to the acting on the faces of the aliens.Don't try to analyze this movie. Just go to see it, sit back, relax (when you can), and be amazed at this stunning achievement!I highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D. Once it is out of the theaters, it may be a long time before you will see anything like this again, and you will NEVER again see this movie like the experience you will have in the theater. Many movies are as good (or better) at home on Blu-ray. That will not be the case with this film.",positive
683,"Avatar – A Spoiler Free Review.So I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of Jame's Camerons Avatar on Wednesday the 16th. I've been waiting for this film for years and I've been so hyped for it as it has gotten closer and closer.In short – My expectations were extremely high and not only were they met, they were blown away.This movie is unlike anything you have ever seen. The CGI is just mind blowingly awesome. James Cameron said that it would be a seamless viewing meaning that you would not be able to tell the difference between what was CGI and what wasn't – he was right.James Cameron said it would be photo-realistic - he was right. James Cameron said the 3D would blow your mind – he was right.For those of you that were not impressed by the CGI in the trailers – let me just say that the trailers are nothing compared to what you see in the film itself.The story itself is engaging. Reminiscent of Dances with Wolves – only more exciting.In my opinion, James Cameron has done what he said he could do. James Cameron has completely revolutionized the way we look at films.Go and see this movie – in 3D as soon as you can.",positive
684,"First off let me say that this was one of the best visual movies I have ever seen. I have never seen a movie with so much CGI look so realistic. I found myself forgetting that what I was watching wasn't real. The scenery, the fight scenes, and the creatures all looked amazing.The acting in this movie was all very good. No one really awed me with great acting, but there was definitely no bad acting.My main issue with this movie is that I have already seen it multiple times. This was one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen. After about 20 minutes you can pretty much guess everything that is going to happen. I feel like they took the story straight out of a Disney movie. This story particularly reminded me of Atlantis and Pocahontas, with even some elements of Tarzan. The story focuses on one member of a group who is encroaching onto the land of another group with supposedly good intentions. The main character actually keeps his good intentions while the rest of the group doesn't and fighting breaks out. Those movies literally have the same storyline. Also I felt the ending was a bit too perfect. It was one of those everything turns out OK and they all live happily ever after endings.;It's not that I don't like this movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a very original movie in all aspects except for the story.",positive
685,"Wow! My wife and I just saw Avatar last night and we were both blown away! We chose to pay the extra money and see it in 3D and it was worth every penny. I was concerned at first, because all of the 3D trailers (and there were a bunch) looked cheesy and a bit unclear, but the opening scene, in the ship, took my breath away and it stayed that way throughout the entire movie. The visual effects were so stunning, they could have easily overshadowed the story and plot, but as amazing as they were, they still took a back seat to this story of good vs evil. During the movie, I became so caught up in the characters, I truly cared what happened to them and how it would end. I am a sci-fi fan, but I almost chose to see a different movie, because I thought the trailers had given away the plot and I didn't see myself enjoying a bunch of thin, blue giants. Luckily, I know not to judge a book by its cover. My wife, who hates sci-fi, may have liked the movie even more than me. She talked about how great it was all night. I'm usually very critical of everything, but there is not one thing I would change about this movie, well one thing...I wish it would have been 4 hours long.",positive
686,"It's impossible to watch AVATAR for the first time – especially a good two years after it first came out – without being influenced by all the fuss surrounding it, with endless critics, fans and reviewers praising it as a game-changing FX movie, a film heralding in a new era of cinematic spectacle, the best movie of all time, yada yada yada. Such praise invariably leaves me cold, which is why I finally caught up with this film not in the cinema but on television during its debut showing. I was in no hurry.My thoughts? AVATAR is a decent film, yes, and one that's highly entertaining – but it's no masterpiece. Cameron works hard and puts in a great deal of effort as director, but it doesn't come close to the strength and power of his earlier one-two pairing, THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS. AVATAR is a film that works on a superficial level as long as you don't think about it too much, and the overly familiar storyline has already been done before in the likes of DANCES WITH WOLVES. Except Cameron had the clever idea of transporting the action to an alien planet and hoping nobody would notice. And you know what? It seems nobody – or very few people - actually did.Does the somewhat slim storyline justify the rather excessive running time? I'm not entirely sure it does. The beginning feels a little slow and the whole fish-out-of-water premise involving the central character's induction to the alien society is rather familiar. Much of the film just seems like an excuse to show off the CGI effects, which are admittedly impressive although not quite as lifelike as Cameron would have you believe. I'd still have preferred them to use unadulterated human actors for the aliens, rather than converting the performances by the actors into pure CGI, but then you can't have anything.As is usual with Cameron, the film is more about the technology and the science rather than the characters. The actors don't make a great deal of impact, it has to be said; the dull Sam Worthington made his name with this and TERMINATOR: SALVATION, two films which barely require him to act. Still, Sigourney Weaver is on hand to show him how it's done, and Stephen Lang makes a great villain, as always (I still remember him from the likes of Steven Seagal actioner FIRE DOWN BELOW in the '90s, and I guess it took a while for everyone else to catch up). It's hard to assess the performers playing the aliens because the effects are just too distracting.At its heart, AVATAR is a simple and straightforward action film, offering the kind of breakneck, breathtaking effects-infused sequences that highlighted TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. It's admittedly beautiful to watch, particularly the alien landscapes brought stunningly to life and the various creatures that inhabit them. The action is engaging, particularly the extensive climax in which the speed picks up a gear and Cameron really lets loose with all kinds of pyrotechnic mayhem. The climax, which seems to run for about forty minutes, displays a willingness to dispatch important characters in a realistic and gritty way, really ending the movie on a high and leaving the viewer with a good impression. It may be familiar – too much so in places – but as a piece of spectacle, AVATAR ticks all the right boxes.",positive
687,"I've experienced Avatar in a local theater in Amsterdam with IMAX and I must say that this movie is one of the best movies ever made. I've never experienced all the human emotions in one movie, this movie made me happy when I was drawn into Avatars world, I mean I would wanna live there and never come back to the real world. In the first scene of the 3D world of Avatar the blue species girl's first line is genius with so much emotion and so powerful. The actors did an outstanding job with convincing me why the Avatar is the most special thing ever. Mr Cameron best work,the movie is about 3 hours long, but it felt like one minute, if you can take me in one breath, this director did it. It's outstandingly perfect, and all the emotion's crying, happiness, anger, depression, feeling real love from the screen this MOVIE comes in with a BANG!",positive
688,"I had very high expectations walking into the movie theater before watching this movie, but I have to say that I was disappointed (probably because my expectations were too high). On the positive side, the movie is somewhat exciting and has good special effects as well as action scenes. For example, the action scenes around that huge tree was awe-inspiring. On the negative side it is filled with clichés and is shockingly predictable and unoriginal. The obvious reference to the current climate debate is just another example of politically correct, self loathing on part of the materialistic lifestyle of rich people in the world. I won't spoil the ending, but don't expect any surprises, because the movie basically tells you what is going to happen at the end by using obvious foreshadowing techniques. The love story is nothing new either. I would still recommend that people watch it so that they can make up their own minds.",neutral
689,After all the hype and praise from all my friends and movie critics I saw it in the movie theater. I didn't see it in 3d but even if I did it would have still been the same crappy movie.After the first hour of sitting through the movie I started to think is it going to get better. It never did. The one thing that really made me angry was the blue chick that kept screaming at Sam Worthington. She made me wan't to pull my hair out. If i had to say something good about this movie i would have to say the cgi was pretty amazing and the last battle scene was also pretty OK.If you haven't seen it yet then i prefer you don't.,negative
690,"First things first its a must watch movie. The only movie which I can compare with ""Avatar"" is ""The Abyss"" directed by James Cameron with similar blueish color lights effect and environment.James Cameron has proved yet again that he is a master in making groundbreaking movies. The graphics is superb but not overwhelming.As soon as the movie starts the viewer is exposed to a whole new world which feels so real and unbelievable. Did I say ""Unbelievable"", not at all, James Cameron makes the viewer completely believe that such world exists.At the end of the movie the viewer would want to be part of Navi's (residents of Pandora planet) rather than part of humans.Navi's live in balance with the nature unlike humans who don't given a damn about it. Nature is god for them.",positive
691,"How should I start?First my Kudos to one and only creator God James Cameron.It was a mind blowing film I ever saw in my life and I am sure this will be the only movie worth watch for everyone in their lifetime.From the starting to ending we will be spellbound with this beautiful world.The theme of bonding,the bird rides, the prayers for spirits and what not everything made my hair go goosebumps.Who is saying there is lack of emotion,every frame has a emotion that will tie you till end,that is why we are this much involved.I think every human who saw this movie will pray to be in Pandora for a day in his life,as I am now.This movie has given life to the characters ,usually it is vice-versa,right:No one can ask more than that.This film has a soul so complete that you yourself go in that.I thought like I will write so much, but here I am wordless ,but everyone just go and see the movie ,not for the big budget sake,not for our very own James Cameron , but to fulfill your fantasy world more than you can imagine.After I came from the movie my heart is so heavy with happiness I can bare,Thank you so much James Cameron from my bottom of the heart.",positive
692,"This is the 1st time I'm reveiwing a movie on IMDb after watching hundreds of movies and this movie is just so great that I had to do it justice by posting a review about it.Without revealing too much, the visuals are absolutely stunning, God only knows how Mr Cameron even conceived the design of such a world in his mind. It must be seen in 3D to be fully appreciated in all its grandeur. There is so much detail, from the bodies of the Na'vi to their fingertips, from the little insects hovering in the air in the forest to the way the individual leaves of grass move on the screen, everything is a visual treat, at times there is so much going on on screen that you don't know which way to look and what to enjoy. It was my first time watching a movie in 3D and the experience was at first uncomfortable during the 1st 30 minutes because I kept switching between the glasses and without the glasses trying to understand the optical illusion before me, after which I convinced myself that rather than question it, I'd go with theflow , once my eyes adjusted to the feeling, it felt like an engrossing experience from there onwards. The film is much like a different kind of Matrix meets Jurrasic Park.The depth of the characters helps convey the reality of the fictional world unfolding before your eyes, without much effort you want to find out more and more about the Na'vi, how they congregate, how they pass their time, their religion and so on, The performances are fantastic, the lead actor and sigourney weaver steal the show.Director Cameron has definitely set the bar high for other motion pictures out there within this category. Thus far, I don't think there's a similar Sci-Fi movie experience out there that truly moves the movie-goer like Avatar does throughout its 180 minutes. It may be a little long to endure but the experience which is uncomparable is definitely worth the cinema ticket and also a revisit or two.It is quite simply a masterpiece of film-making that has to be seen and appreciated (leaving home all your doubts and pessimistic criticisms), enjoy this for what it is meant to be, a surreal, visually magnificent, unrivalled, beautiful and magical experience that totally blows you away from scene 1 to the end. You don't expect to see anything quite like the magic that captivates you when you see Avatar for the 1st time.Naturally, some girls may hate it, some people may be put off by the alien love story or the mushy romantic scenes, its not everyones cup of tea,but then again, not everyone goes in with a blank canvas, thats what you need to be blown away by this movie - an empty canvas to paint this new experience on.",positive
693,"Simply put: You have to see it to believe it!!! Fantastic, well worth 10 out of 10.I saw this movie on Christmas Eve as a friend recommended it to me. This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best Sci/Fi Action movie in the past 5 years. Cameron managed to create a completely self-contained world which is 100% believable and emotionally involving.The only weak side of the movie was the story, which could have been developed better. The story was, in essence, a moral tale for a younger audience; I guess it was a trade-off for the filmmakers. Despite this, the movie it thoroughly enjoyable, engaging and, above all, believable.",positive
694,"Avatar's biggest highlight has always been its visuals. Pandora is a magical place and James Cameron manages to build and immerse this world very well. The photography is perfect and the visual effects are magnificent. It is impossible to watch and not be enchanted by the colors and all the beauty of the planet. However, one problem that has always been cited about the film is in relation to its story and characters. The plot is very simple and repetitive. You won't find anything new when it comes to history. Stories like Avatar have been explored several times in cinema and it is already possible to decipher everything that will happen just by presenting the story. The characters are bland, they don't have a charisma that makes you fall in love with them. The protagonist is the worst among them all. These details prevent Avatar from being an even better film. But, in my opinion, the film remains incredible and these details don't make it bad or mediocre, they just weaken something incredible.",positive
695,"The marines and humans are the new world coming over to America (Pandora) and the aliens are the Native Americans (using bows and arrows against steal and guns). The main character befriends the daughter of the chief and in the end fights against his own people along side of the Native Americans (aliens). James Cameron has literally created a new medium. The complete integration of CGI with real life. using as much data from both worlds at the same time.Also, did anyone notice that he broke the animation realness curve? As you approach hyper real with a human in CGI, it begins to look worse. James Cameron was able to assemble together enough techs and artists to break that curve and create realistic humans that don't look ""odd"". Remember all those terrible parts in the new Star Wars films where you can immediately tell that it was a CG character? (like Darth Maul jumping and doing a back flip when Qui-Gon says ""Anakin, get down!""There was NONE of that in this movie, it looked so natural. I can't believe they filmed it in a gym, with no sets?!?! (i mean obviously there were some sets, but whatever.)11 out of 10, this movie breaks ground, smashes open a cavernous gap in reality and releases 10,000 Buddha natures onto the world.",positive
696,"Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington are not bad... not at all! But it's a love story that overtook all the problems and ended up incredibly well, and I don't see this as a good script. Even though it's in PANDORA, which is, by the way, what a beautiful place to live, it's just simple. This film is just HUGE, but I've seen this before, ""our green is gone"", ""human being are unstoppable"", ""what a bad behavior we have"", ""we just think about money, omg there's more than that!!!"", MANY movies has shown me this. On the other hand, the 3-D experience is unforgettable. The visual effects made the film, and also James Cameron obsession to perfection. I wonder how many years he'll take to the sequel. I don't think that 2012, Harry Potter and Star Trek stand a chance for the Academy. A great film, but I've seen better.",positive
697,"The first time I saw the ""Avatar"" preview, I thought it looked strange. The second time, I thought the dialogue looked good. The third time, I was thinking about seeing it. The fourth time, I was nudging my boyfriend saying, ""Can we go see that?""So, when we went to see it, I was expecting something that probably had the potential to be good, but I wasn't quite sure. When we left the theater, I was stunned by the--yes, I'll say it--epic nature of the movie. I don't think I can sufficiently describe the movie, other than it is just full of fantastic.I've seen reviews on here about how 3D makes the entire movie. I respectfully disagree. If you went to ""Avatar"" expecting a 100% original, never-before-seen storyline with characters who aren't even slightly predictable and all that, then you might as well never watch another movie. You will never, ever find a movie that does not depict something that someone else in time thought of or already made a movie about. That being said, the 3D simply added to the movie. It was not the only reason ""Avatar"" was amazing.If you're looking to see incredible visual effects, on both the 3D and imaginative levels, then go see ""Avatar."" If you want to watch a movie with a mix of everything from ""Hell yeah!"" scenes, to romantic moments, to times when you feel that you yourself are the character, then go see ""Avatar.""10 out of 10 stars from me.",positive
698,"There is no denying the truly awesome visual impact of this film. The action sequences and overall visual force of the film are stunning. The plot is something less. While I was impressed by a number of the individual ideas in the film (the avatar concept is interesting as is the communication of information, direction and emotion between species), the underlying plot line is, to say the least, played out. The big bad evil company is looking for an extremely valuable mineral ""unobtainium"" and will let nothing and no one, least of all the indigenous people, keep them from their profits. Please. All of this retelling of the cowboys (evil humanity) and Indians (the Na'vi) with a fair amount of love for the non-material, Gaia-based lifestyle presented by the Indians is a little hard to take. This is especially true coming from Cameron/Hollywood, a person and place based on materialism in the extreme. The IMDb Trivia Section on this film says it all: Cameron took the cast and crew to Hawaii to commune with nature. They ""spent their days trekking through the forests and jungles and living like tribes (building campfires, eating fish, etc), in order to get a better sense of what it would be like to live and move around in the jungle on Pandora."" That was only during the days. Their nights were spent at a Four Seasons Hotel.",neutral
699,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was subjected to it during a three hour bus ride home, with little other entertainment. It turned out to be like many other Hollywood films, a good basic idea but the execution of it was appalling. In future, Hollywood should pass its ideas onto European film-makers, just to make them bearable.Aside from the bad acting, I have two main gripes that make this film so much worse than many of its Hollywood fellows. Firstly, the only original thing about it are the CGI effects. These, admittedly, are stunning. However, the actual plot of the story is so similar to many other Hollywood films, I'm surprised James Cameron bothered making it. It's basically Fern Gully with a massive budget. My second complaint is the budget itself. It's astronomical and was totally squandered. Just think how that money could have been spent, say on healthcare, education and the like. But no, instead it gets spent on a shockingly average film.This film could have been great, but the recycled storyline destroyed any vestige of that.",negative

I have read many other reviews on this and people have been nay saying about the plot and character development. I did not see a problem with either. I really felt connected to the main character and his struggle to pick sides. I also felt for the indigenous people for their plight. There is plenty of story telling where you get to know more about the Na'vi culture. There is talk about how earth is in the future and why the humans are there on Pandora. Some of the story telling is subtle, but it is all there. I left the theater thrilled and will go see this again. It is hands down, the best movie of the year and I recommend it to anyone who can sit in a theater chair for two and a half hours.",positive
701,"These days it's rare for a ""block buster"" movie to live up to its hype and even rarer for a film to exceed this hype. But James Cameron delivered. This fill is nothing short of amazing. Cameron took on the task of challenging your reality without seeming unrealistic. This was accomplished flawlessly. Cameron created a world where you can fly on mythological pterodactyl like creature, plant life glows in the dark and mountains float. The world where this film was set in will truly blow your mind.But every rose has its thorns. With a Titanic size budget I was truly expecting a DiCaprio size performance from the leading cast but I was left wanting. I felt that the movies main characters (Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and Zoe Saldana) delivered strong above average performances. But there were far too many one dimensional characters. You honestly couldn't care less if these characters lived or died. Also there was a drill sergeant character that littered the movie with cheesy dialog that detracted from the moves over all awe inspiring feel.Despite some of the one dimensional character this was an excellent film. The story line was nothing short of original. The love story aspect of the film was well developed and realistic. This movie has forever changed the fantasy and science fiction film genre. James Cameron has set the bar so high that few directors will ever reach it.",positive
702,"Yes, that's right. I said many flaws, and I didn't say ""more qualities"" or something like that, and yet I gave this movie 10 out of 10. Don't ask me why, I'm just sure that that's what it deserves.This movie is my generation's Star Wars. It is the movie we see in the theater (especially if we follow it with IMAX 3d... trust me and don't see Avatar that way for your first time, but see it that way eventually!) and are blown away by not just through sheer spectacle, but more importantly through the incredible immersion that the movie manages to give you.I'm serious about how important this is. It's a science-fiction action movie with a plot lifted out of many other films (epic classics of film history, but still other films), and yet it manages to immerse you into the setting like those other stories just... didn't. This is the sort of thing that pushes not necessarily all the right buttons, but rather pushes buttons you didn't know you had, causing you to go ""wtfomgwowthisisincredibleahhhh!"" at many different moments that are actually about a half-and-half mix between action moments and actual scenes of character development and setting exposition.Okay, so that may be over some peoples' heads. Just let it suffice for me to say that you must see this movie unless you are prone to motion sickness or annoyance from loud noises, as well as if you have to leave the theater at any point in a 2-1/2 hour time period, because the movie is really that important to see the whole way through, with proper sound, and on a proper screen.Eventually, Avatar will be sent to the tiny screens and the tinny speakers of our multiplexes and then our homes. Seriously, that is a shame because this movie is worth seeing just for the spectacle, even with all the flaws and deeper qualities (no I don't mean the moralistic messages, those are so obvious they're almost self-defeating).Enough of my yapping, get out there and see this movie, because James Cameron and the rest of the crew (who I'm intentionally going to sit through the credits for next time, with the great job they did) deserve your money infinitely more than the makers of most of the blockbusters or tearjerkers or romances of this year. Seriously, they did a good job.",positive
703,"I have just seen the 3D version of Avatar. And i have to say that it is probably the best movie that i have ever seen.It can clearly be seen that the director has done his best effort to let this movie leave an imprint on your mind. There is just so much emotion going on in the movie. The story might not be the most original but it is told so beautifully that it just grips on to you.The entire movie just makes you fall in love with characters and their way of living. The beauty of the environment and the emotion put into it is just indescribable. Even though it was a 3 hour ride, the movie ends sooner than you expect and you want it to last even longer. All i can say this is a must see movie for anyone!",positive
704,"I'll say this for James Cameron: he always entertains, good and bad.First up, if there was an Academy Award for Best Imagination, Cameron would get the nod for Avatar, in my opinion. This production takes Cameron's visionary approach to story-telling to a new level and has indeed set a new benchmark in film art. When viewed in 3D at the cinema, this experience will leave all but the jaded in a state of awe, almost, with the most thrilling mix of fantastic creatures and battle scenes that may not be equaled for a long, long time.However...don't pay too much attention to this story. Because it's been told too many times before, in different ways. Think of Dances with Wolves (1990); recall Broken Arrow (1950); remember The New World (2005); consider Apocalypse Now (1979); or, even On the Waterfront (1954) – in each of which, the protagonist hero turns his back on his own kind to fight on the side of the 'alien' or 'hostile' gang or horde. The fact that Cameron's setting is hundreds of years in the future is neither here nor there: thematically, it's the same story.The most imaginative feature for me is the application of the Gaia principle – the entire moon of Pandora is an interconnected living thing – to assist the Na'vi in defeating the hated invaders i.e. us. And it's no accident the moon is called Pandora: if you recall your Greek mythology, you'll know what happens to those who open Pandora's box: full of horrible nasties ready to kill you. And, oh yeah, this movie also rehashes the timeless Pocahontas theme.So, the real power in Cameron's story is entirely allegorical: in the same way that we humans are slowly poisoning and destroying the Earth around us, so also the invading army on Pandora – the mythical moon to a much larger planet – is intent upon pillaging or destroying whatever necessary to gain 'unobtainium', that rarest and most expensive of rare metals. On that point, you have to admire Cameron's chutzpah in using that name - almost the best joke in the story.The best, however, comes at the end – naturally – when the Na'vi indigenes corral all the Earthly mercenaries to ship them back to their own dying planet: a nice self-referential twist on Pogo's sentiment that 'We have met the enemy and he is us.'The cast and script are up to the job, but nothing to garner awards. Those will come, deservedly I think, for a host of technical aspects – cinematography, editing, sound, special effects etc – that make this film unique. And maybe even for best director. Some lines and scenes bear striking resemblance to aspects of prior Cameron movies; but, I guess it's okay to rehash bits of your own stuff.Anyway, go and see it on the big screen – you'll be sorry if you wait for DVD. I broke my fifteen year hiatus from actual cinema-going just to experience this one as it should be. You might even go twice, as I did...",positive
705,"In the future, humans have traveled to the far reaches of the universe. On a planet called Pandora, a very important new element was discovered, one that is very valuable. But, wouldn't you know, the natives on the planet live in the forest, where most of the element is located, underground. It is the human intention to ""displace"" the natives out of their woods and get to the mineral. For years, the Americans have occupied an outpost on the planet and have tried peaceful methods to reason with the aliens. The top scientist, Grace (Sigourney Weaver) learned their language and opened a ""school"" to teach the native children English and the ways of the human. But, the Pandoran population truly wants none of it, for they rightly feel that their world will be destroyed. Although they have only bows and arrows, with a killing poison attached, they are very fierce. As a last resort, the Marines are trying a program of elaborate ""robots"", where an earthling goes into a sort of capsule and sleeps while his ""soul"" inhabits a native body. It is their hope that learning the ways of the natives will make them easier to ""conquer"" and move. Now, a wheelchair-bound Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) gets a new, Pandoran body and goes with Grace and a few others on a mission. But, due to some fierce dinosaur-like creatures, Jake becomes separated from the others and is left in the forest at night. Grace believes he will surely die. He would have, too, for a powerful female warrior, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) was set to shoot him. But, some seeds from their ""tree of life"" cover Jake and Neytiri sees it as an omen. She takes Jake back to her village where he is eventually accepted as a tribesman. He learns to ride the native ""horses"" and ""dragons"". He and Neytiri also fall in love. But, during the night, Jake ""reports"" back to the Marines when his native body is asleep. The marine commander believes he is gathering information to defeat the primitive folk. As one might guess, Jake soon realizes his new people are very worthy and should not be destroyed or moved, for their life is ""connected"" deeply to the forest, their home. What will Jake do to save Neytiri and his new brothers and sisters? This is an amazing film, a stunningly visual panorama that has to be seen to be believed. The planet of Pandora is a forest like no other, with plants that ""glow"" and creatures that resemble dinosaurs, wolves, and dragons. The natives, too, resemble the American Indian and other earthly tribes, such as the residents of the Amazon rain forests. Most importantly, they are ""attached"" to their planet as the Native Americans were to the earth. When they kill an animal for food, they utter prayers to the animal for giving his life so that they might be sustained. They consider the destruction of any plant a blow to their own bodies. Thus, in many respects, the movie is a gigantic homage to the American Indian and their way of life. Wes Studi, who was the ultra frightening Native American in The Last of the Mohicans, even plays the Pandoran leader. But, enough of this. The actors, including Worthington, Weaver, Saldana, Ribisi, Stephen Lang and all of the rest do a fine job. The dialogue and story are, perhaps, not totally original but quite, quite adequate. However, even all these take a back seat to the incredibly imaginative scope of the film's setting, a new world far away. It is the grand scale of the forested planet that will take a viewer's breath away. In short, dear film fan, see it. Absolutely, if you can go to only ONE film this year or next, make it AVATAR. It is truly a jaw-dropping work that will overwhelm most anyone with its visionary beauty.",positive
706,"My review of this film is guna be short but sweet. This movie for me was very simple, i easily identified who the bad guys were and the hero. The movie itself was well paced and had impressive CGI. As for the acting it really wasn't that great, i mean honestly the computers did most of the work. But where i got a little thrown off was when this movie somehow broke all the box office records??! It just goes to show that with enough money to pump into a film, and enough hype it can be a powerhouse, But that doesn't mean it deserves Oscars and globes. Avatar was good just not THAT good. All in All id pay 10 bucks to see it but only for the 3d and it wouldn't be my first choice in the list of blockbusters",positive
707,"Let me start by saying Avatar is rough around the edges. Not the greatest acting, cheesy lines, and a predictable and worn out story are a few of its problems, so why do I give it a ten? It comes down to one factor: emotion.Simply put, Avatar took me to a different world, figuratively and literally. I found myself entranced for the entire 160 minutes. How many movies can leave you extremely entertained and happy beyond your wildest dreams, yet sad because you cannot be a part of the world that you just experienced? None before Avatar in my experience. This movie is by far and away my favorite movie of all time. Even the sadness of coming back to reality and realizing in our lifetimes we will never come across a world (pandora) or group of people (the na'vi) as beautiful as those in Avatar is worth it.Unfortunately, Avatar's greatest asset is also its downfall for those that don't see it as beautiful. If you are not emotionally gripped by Avatar, all that is left is the so-so acting, script, and tired story. While this may be so for many movies, I think has a greater effect on Avatar.If you are one of the people who saw Avatar and were transported to another dimension, then good for you. I'm right there with you. For those that didn't connect with it on a deeper level, well, I'm sorry. I feel like you are missing out on an experience that should be felt by everyone.",positive
708,"Let me preface this brief review by saying that my IMAX viewing of this was hindered by the fact that the 3D was broken and I got to see it in glorious IMAX 2D. I went into this knowing how horrible the story was going to be and I just wanted to see what it was like in 3D since everybody wouldn't shut up about it. So I go in and I see 30 seconds of trees in 3D and it goes dark and the manager says the 3D is broken, but my stub will work as a free pass the next time I go to that theater. Only problem was that I was on vacation at the time and so I just wasted almost 20 bucks on a 2D movie.So anyway onto the review. Sam Worthington, God bless him, is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. I wouldn't have minded so much if his bloody Aussie accent hadn't been bleeding through his horrible attempt at an American accent. Just be an Aussie for crying out loud. Now I will say that the visuals were, for the most part, very beautiful to look at, even without the 3D effect the Na'vi appeared to be incredibly life-like and not CG. However, everything else was pure obvious CG dribble, but pretty CG dribble at least. The not-so-subtle environmental message literally made me feel like I was watching Ferngully again, with Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves's story mixed in. Now I'm all for saving the planet, but seriously, watching this makes me want to chop down every tree I see. Lastly just some nitpicks I have. The name of the planet/moon/world Pandora is probably the most unoriginal name for anything I can think of. Also, unobtainium or whatever is also very stupid and unoriginal, see The Core to see what that movie stole that elemental title from. James Cameron, PLEASE, just make another terminator or aliens movie and leave this film to the rest of the hippies in Hollywood",positive
709,"Avatar is obviously a visually appealing film. The CGI is expertly done and the details in everything is amazing. The color is rich and vibrant, the moving is fluid, and everything is beautiful.Okay, enough. The above is essentially what most reviewers say about Avatar: that it is a revolutionary visual masterpiece. What else? A movie isn't just the visual appeal! If the visual appeal is so very wonderful, they why don't they film natural beauty? Visuals are just a tool to make sure the viewers know what's going on. So? Why spend so much money and time making a visual masterpiece without understanding the ultimate elements to a quality film? Basically, what James Cameron was like after making Titanic was: ""Oh my god, I want to make another film. Let's make this film so visually stunning that everybody will be captivated."" James Cameron is doing his animation business, and a few weeks before the release, a man notifies James Cameron of something important: ""Um, sir, you know, you have to make, um, a storyline."" ""What? I have to make a STORYLINE? WITH CHARACTERS! Are you insane?"" ""Well, um, sir, I'm sure you could write something up on this weekend, uhh, yeah!"" ""Brilliant! That'll do!"" In the long run, nothing happens for the first hour, the characters are pasted into the story, and when emotions try to be thrown around, they are blocked.In my opinion, Avatar was just a showcase of visuals. James Cameron decided ""Hey, you know, people are stimulated by visuals. Let's make Avatar!"" An absolute insult to all humanity.",negative
710,"James Cameron is back and he really shows, that he did not loose his ""Mojo"". Avatar is just mind blowing and the visuals are absolutely stunning. The story might not be new, but with mankind robbing and destroying the earth, unable to listen to the sound of nature, it is more actual than ever. With Pandora, Cameron created a unique new fantasy world, worth every minute watching. The CGI sets new standards in movie making and animates a breathtaking environment, magical, spiritual, threatened by the human race in its excessive and disrespectful greed for money and economic growth. Sounds familiar? Hello rain forest. Anyway: entertaining, beautiful, sad, funny, dramatic, thrilling, romantic, spiritual,....: Hollywood at its best. Cameron is the man. Thank you for Avatar! Hope it does not only entertain but will also make people think. Cause we got our own ""Pandora"" here if we don't destroy it... The 3-D added a touch of magic that Im going to miss later on BluRay... Just awesome...",positive
711,"Avatar is clearly the movie of this year, featuring visuals so vibrant that they are beautiful enough to make you weep. Combine that with a motion capture technology that actually works and you have something special. If you want a comparison go view Robert Zemeckis' ""A Christmas Carol"" done for Disney. That film featured CGI figures that were not emotive and eerily conjured visions of soul-dead zombies. In contrast, Cameron provides characters that seem to be living breathing individuals.Since there is nothing to criticize in the visual area, people have concentrated on the story telling of this feature. They seem to forget that this is a genre piece that pretty much closely adheres to the conventions of heroic fantasy. These include: (1) An outsider or low-born individual who will rise to the top. (2)He will eventually wed the unobtainable beautiful queen or princess in contradiction of cultural norms and expectations. (3)He (it is almost always a he) will justify his rise in prominence by fulfilling a prophecy or legend that results in the salvation of either his people or his newly adopted people. Is this an original tale? No. Go to any book store and in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy aisle you can find tons of slight variations of this tale. These tales would include the Lord of the Rings, The Sword of Truth, The Wheel of Time, and The Song of Fire and Ice among their many volumes. While there are dozens of dozens of similar tales, these are the well-done titles of exemplars. This is what Avatar is--a genre film that has been realized to the nth degree. If you are looking for more creativity, you'll have to await the sequels.Accept this film for what it is and you'll not be disappointed in any way. James Cameron did not attempt a genre busting film, he fully embraced the genre and then knocked it out of the park.",positive
712,"This was the best movie I have ever seen, by far.If you like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings you will be thrilled by this one.The first time I sat with tears in my eyes during three quarters of the time.This is a classic. And the current rate people are giving it is far to low.It's way above Shawshank Redemption (which is also one of my favorites).True is doesn't have much room actors finesse. The film is just to fast and overwhelming to blend in much subtle play. But anyone knowledgeable on politics and the few cultures still living on our planet in conjunction with nature will recognize and appreciate all kind of stuff, like the way the Pandorians greet each other, woven into the story.",positive
713,"James Cameron (Terminator 2, Titanic) returns after a 12-year hiatus with his ultimate yet risky science project that he said he would make. Cameron promised that we will not only love it, but it will change the way movies are made forever. He was right. After his brother was killed in battle, paraplegic Jake Sully (Worthington) decides to take his brother's place on a mission to the distant moon of ""Pandora"". There, he learns the greedy intentions of Parker Selfridge (Ribisi), who plans to drive out the native humanoid ""Na'Vi"" by any means necessary to mine a precious material that is worth 20 million US dollars a kilo. In return for providing Intel as an ""Avatar"", he will be able to have an expensive surgery to heal is paralyzed legs. He quickly falls for one of the beautiful Na'Vi, Neytiri (Saldana), who helps him become one of them. Jake soon finds himself torn, and he must decide to do either what is right, or carry out his mission and doom the Na'Vi. ""Avatar"" is a sweeping epic filled with beautiful visual effects that are literally as big as James Cameron's dreams. ""Avatar"" is as technically stunning and influential as ""Star Wars"" was in 1977. The moon of Pandora is the most fascinating and creative setting in a film that I have ever seen. There is no doubt in my mind that ""Avatar"" at the very least has ""Best Visual Effects"" Oscar in the bag (and hopefully many more). The technical achievements definitely outweigh the story-line, acting, and screenplay, but only because that the visual effects are so mind-blowing and so groundbreaking. Not to detract from the other elements, but they are simply just not groundbreaking. We have heard this story before (Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai), one could argue that it is mostly voice-acting, and as far as the screenplay goes, everybody says what they are supposed to, and the story itself is fairly predictable. Even though we have heard this story before, the execution is nearly perfect. The acting was very good as far as action flicks go. Sam Worthington (who was brilliant in Terminator Salvation) is on his way to being one of the top actors in Hollywood. He gives a fine performance, and makes us truly care about him and the choices he makes. Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Gorillas in the Mist) shows that she hasn't lost her gusto since her heyday as Ellen Ripley in the ""Alien"" films. She fits in the genre so well and embraces her character, Grace. The greatest job of all was perhaps Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) as Neytiri. She gives an excellent voice-acting performance as the alien princess, showing incredible range and emotion. Perhaps Avatar's weakness is the screenplay. A lot of people will attack the film for being too long, and that it had little to no characterization or character development. They will say the characters were one-dimensional and bland compared to the technical achievements of the film. Although this is Avatar's (very minor) ""weakness"", I would have to disagree. Okay, the characterization isn't perfect, but neither was ""Titanic"" (which went on to win 11 Oscars). There are MANY moments when the characters are so dynamic, so multi-faceted, and show true emotion. ""Avatar"" is a sweeping and immersive epic that will change the way movies are made. It takes you to a spectacular world far beyond imagination. Cameron's 15 year-old concept is now a reality after 4 years of meticulous film-making. The themes are so advanced and allegoric, but are executed beautifully and not shoved down the viewer's throat. This review in no way can do it any justice, except for when I tell you that it is a MUST-SEE. It is one of the best films of the decade, and of all time.Rating: 9.5/10",positive
714,"With great expectations, my guest and I laid down $20.00 for a matinée, to view the greatest 3D film ever to be shown on the silver screen! Three fourths of the way through, I was still looking for that film. To be more precise, I felt as though I had gone through a time machine, to my youth in the 1950's on a Saturday afternoon, watching 35 cartoons and two 3D science fiction films. Avatar was the same old Cowboys and Indians all over again but in reverse. On the planet Pandora, humans are seeking the path to unlimited power at the cost of the indigenous population. The name of the planet, Pandora, should give the audience a clue, that maybe this is a box better left closed. The citizens of Pandora live in harmony with each other and their entire planet. The humans, who want to study the Na'vi, incubate Avatars in which they can join psychologically and mingle with the general population. The company the scientists work for are a paramilitary organization who will stop at nothing to obtain their goal. So we have the Na'vi on one side and the paramilitary on the other side, who do you think will win? Does the name of the film give you the slightest hint? I thought so. James Cameron who wrote and directed this 3D film to end all 3D films should have stopped at 120 minutes and left the other 40 for his director's cut.",neutral
715,"This is a turning point for cinema.James Cameron has foregone the hokey throwing the Axe at the screen 3-D to forge a subtle, immersing, action adventure.It is the work of someone who is truly in control of his vision and is capable of bringing it to the screen.Put simply, amazing film, with s powerful performance at its center(hello Zoe Saldana)!Not since The Matrix has there been a film that had to be seen at the Cinema.Do yourself the favour. 10/10",positive
716,"OK, I'm a woman. And a non-American. And I adore mostly artistic movies, not really the Hollywood blockbusters. So, maybe I'm not the right one to comment on this. Still I have to say, for the sake of the ones who are like me (and I'm sure I'm not alone here) - it's just not THAT good, and it could be much better.Visually, this movie is really amazing. The world in it is just completely magnificent. From that point of view, this movie will not disappoint anyone and is truly something new and special. On the other hand, since they've put so much effort into trying to make something really revolutionary - I really expected that the scriptwriters would not hold onto every possible existing cliché they could put in a movie. The characters are SO one-dimensional (to begin with the two main characters, the main scientist, the Latino girl, the ""jealous guy"" and to end with unbelievably the same ""army general"" figure), the dialogs are hundreds-of-times-seen-before, the development of the story also, not to mention the ""the cool American guy who is total newbie and quite stupid does something several generations of native people couldn't do"" thing.I truly expected more from this movie, because I expected at least a bit more of originality in every aspect and not just with the special effects.Still I have to say - everyone should see it. Most of you will be delighted with the movie and the rest who are like me will at least have a look at the really wonderful fantasy world.6.5/10",neutral

Hope to see Avatar made into a trilogy and I hope to see it quite soon. This movie is movie magic at its best.go watch it you won't regret it :D",positive
718,"Like almost everyone else alive, I was looking forward to Avatar but I wasn't going on opening day or even opening week. I waited and lucky me, when I went to see it in IMAX 3D at 10am on a Saturday morning, there weren't even 30 people in the auditorium. Clean, comfy, and quiet. Just the way I like to see my movies that I pay for. Online ticketing was trying to charge me 15 bucks plus service fee. I paid at the box office because I knew it wasn't gonna sell out like it did the night before when I really wanted to go. 9 bucks was the tally. Can't beat that.Say what you wanna say and feel how you wanna feel about me for saying what I'm about to say, but I thought the movie totally sucked! That's right, I said it. This movie might as well have been a children's book it was so fluffy. Minimal cussing (even with the military present in this flick), no non-human nudity, straightforward plot with no twists or turns, ultra predictable, monotone and unmemorable characters, borderline unrealistic war motives, pointless deaths, uncreative and fairy tale climax, and the environmental theme was thrown in your face so much that you'd think you were watching a PBS special. Special effects aside (they were top-notch), there was nothing I liked about this movie. I very rarely laughed. I don't think I did at all. Only thing that got a chuckle from a few peeps was when the antagonist said he was part of the Jarhead Clan. That's about it. It was a practically emotionless movie-going experience.I mean, come on. You turn on your own species over a girl? She gives you a piece and that's all it takes? I can see about him wanting to become one of them because of the girl and having a functional body but is he really ready to live the natural life and abandon TV, internet, and all the other wonders of human technology? Yes, the tech is a demon and it can also be a godsend. I get it. But that morality was never discussed or explored. No civilized human alive would just switch that quick. I ain't buying it. Regardless of the cost for him to get new legs, I ain't buying it. Things could have been done differently. The world they created and the creatures within it were a little too forced for my taste. Took up too much screen time that could have been devoted to adding more complexity to an otherwise oversimplified plot. The whole deal was just too textbook. No depth at all.3D effects weren't so good. All the previews before the movie were of 3D movies, all of them kid movies. I expect more from 3D. I've gotten more from 3D. Those previews and the movie didn't deliver the goods. Depth perception is altered but nothing moves beyond the four corners of the screen or comes out at you. The IMAX screen was big with a crisp, clear picture and sound. I'll give credit where it's due. But save your money and if you have to see this movie, just watch it on a regular screen for a regular price. I would tell you to just wait for it on Blu-ray and if you have a nice sized TV, just watch it that way. To me, it's not worth a penny. It's boring and not at all entertaining. The only surprises were seeing Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi. Wasn't expecting to see those two. If this movie was Rated R and more authentic, then maybe it'd be worth a whirl. But as it is, if you have the mentality of a simple-minded and impressionable 10 year old, this movie is tailor-made for you. I give it 4 out of 10 stars. I don't care how popular it is or how much money it's made and is gonna make. For me, it sucks chicken bones. A complete and total waste of time and money. I'm disappointed more than anything. I expect better from James Cameron.Even with all that said, this movie still got a round of applause when it finished. Now it joins the ranks of Equilibrium, the Godzilla teaser trailer, Spirited Away, and the first live-action Transformers movie as the only movies I've been in attendance of that have gotten some applause. Nothing happens after the credits so don't waste your time even further like I did. And when I left the auditorium, there was a long line of people waiting to get in for the next showing. Wanted to tell them so bad that the movie is a dud but everyone has their own tastes. I would have been upset even more if I had to wait in a line like that to see such a horrible movie. It only got those 4 stars from me because of the innovative special effects and Zoe Saldana's voice acting. Everything else? FAIL!",neutral

Pandora people love their land 3.Humans try to chase them out either by diplomacy or warThats it..

The novelty of the CGI wears off quickly and then there's another 2 hours of movie to slog through. I was expecting better from James Cameron. So many years in development and yet almost nothing creative in it. It seems with CGI there's even less room than usual to change things as you go along when it becomes apparent they're not working. But the script, written by Cameron, was quite bad to begin with. He must have just been given free reign due to his past successes, and, given the commercial success of Avatar, will probably be again, unfortunately, with no one daring to tell him anything sucks or that its been done better before and he needs to either come up with something new or find someone who can. The story was so derivative and simplistic I felt like rolling my eyes and had to make myself finish it. I'll certainly be screening his future movies more carefully, no matter how much money they make.",negative
721,"This is my first review ever on IMDb, and it follows me leaving the cinema 15 minutes ago. The movie gave breakthrough advances in cinematic technology, the birth of the new 3D, Real D, and also a good 2 and a half hours of great entertainment which left me wanting more of the same breed.I watched the film with huge expectations after seeing a 20 minute preview in new york, back in July.I was originally sceptical of the use of 3D having seen the other releases this past year, Final destination, my bloody valentine and a handful of 3d animation films, using 3D as nothing more as a unique selling point, and a use to get cheap shocks. Avatar finally see's the breakthrough of this.Since the 1920's 3Dimensional cinema has tried to make its mark and failed, but with focusing more on deep field photography as oppose to the objects flying towards you, is now a proved success. The elaborate colourful world of Pandora is really brought to life with the long shots viewing the never ending wild mountains and forests, whilst fast-paced action entertains the foreground.The huge artillery used by the army to the arrows used by the na'vis also shows massive steps into making animation looking as real as possible, and for first time i can recall, actually looked impressive alongside real action.My only snag about the movie, is that some of the performances could have been stronger but nevertheless, they pulled together to back up the breathtaking special effects.9/10",positive
722,"I would give it 10 just to pi$$ off all those who gave it very low rating, as everybody who did so has simply no imagination.But this movie deserves every credit it can get. It is above all is to envision where the future cinema takes us. And that future invites us to live the movies in a way unseen before.I'm looking forward to more movies like this, and of course to continuation of the Avatar trilogy.Sincerest thanks to James Cameron for sharing his dreams with us.P.S. Where seeds of all spirits, root on thy tree of souls, may they lighten my path",positive
723,"HooYeah!!! Indeed a supreme film. Excellently done by Mr. Cameron. If anyone can describe it, then TRY it. For I can not do so. I watched the whole movie with a lot of popcorn and lemon juice. The acting, casting, surrounding all are flawless.In my eyes this could be the movie of the year. The story is a very good one too. I see some big follow ups of this kinda movies. Let us all hope for more of these kinda movies to come in 2k10. I watched the whole movie with a lot of popcorn and lemon juice. If you don't have anything to do then go watch this awesome movie. It will help you to have more movie fun to make it trough the day. Take a lot of food with you when you go.TIP: >Just see the movie.<",positive
724,"Avatar is escapism at its finest. Even if the story isn't as original as the groundbreaking visuals it's still a well told one that's designed to be crowd pleasing whilst having deeper themes that can be as accessible and wide reaching as possible. It takes its time to get going so everything can be introduced at a nice speed and saves the best action for the grand finale so it ends on the biggest high.Sam Worthington makes Jake Sully a likeable protagonist who's fish out of water antics make him a solid audience surrogate and his constantly slipping accent only adds to the charm. Zoe Saldaña wholeheartedly commits to being Navi so the culture that's introduced is believable and the emotional core of their connection to the planet feels so earnest, exemplified by any emotional distress or euphoria she displays.Stephen Lang excels as the kind of tough as nails villain who makes sure he's suited up into a giant robot mech suit before putting out the fire on his shoulder. There's no greater depth here, just a bad guy who enjoys what he's doing. Science fiction icon Sigourney Weaver reunites with her Aliens director for a great role as someone who never backs down whilst also having a deep affection for the planet and its people.James Cameron's direction is so immersive, crafting a fully realised world that is very easy to get lost in, especially when employing some of the best 3-D ever put to screen. When it comes to the spectacle, he remains a master of large-scale action with a climactic battle that wages war on land and in the sky simultaneously. Once it gets everything it can out of that, proceedings get personal with a one on one fight that's just as thrilling.The CGI and motion capture on display here is astonishing. The level of detail in the characters means they never look uncanny and the CGI still holds up with every aspect of Pandora being breathtaking in some way. Funnily enough the only thing showing its age are the live action elements. The reason for James Horner's score being the way it is is ironic however, this is still a tremendously epic score that's rife with sweeping emotion.",positive
725,"So, I saw this film on Saturday night. I expected it to be a normal Cameron film, which should be amazing...This film was more than amazing, it was phenomenal! The special effects were stunning, and in 3D even more amazing! James Cameron really outdid himself on this film!After three and a half hours at the theatre (I know the film is 162 mins, but I got there early to get good seats, which I did.) I walked out after the credits, amazed at the most amazing film ever made, my all time favourite now. I saw it with my friends and said it was the movie of the decade. There has been many great movies over the last nine years, nothing compares to Avatar.Thanks for taking the time to read my review of this visually stunning, amazing, an well written/directed film...MrWhiskers_III",neutral
726,"I saw this movie in 3D, it was the first movie I saw in 3D so I can't compare it to anything else. But I have to say in spite of the fact that I arrived late to a packed house and got a lousy seat, it was still a neat experience. there is a real effect of depth to the environments, although I wish i could say the same for the story or characters. The story has been done 1000 times before in a different setting. Outsider tries to inveterate enemy, falls in love, sees the error of his ways and becomes part of, and fights for the clan he has tried to destroy. sort of like the story of the American Indians done in many a western.The acting is average, The story and script well below average. So all you are left with is some eye candy in 3D, and that keeps you entertained when the story gets dull and slow. but it is worth the price of admission, but only in 3D. Brilliant technology but not much substance",neutral
727,"In my opinion this is the best film in existence, i saw it in 3d and the scenery is incredible, you feel as if you are really in the jungle. The action was great, it was pacey, and had a good romance story through it as well.Cameron does an excellent job of making you sympathise with the aliens and disdain the humans. The acting was not the best feature but it was still good, especially sam worthington, who i thought was the ownly positive to come out of terminator salvation. Some people complained about things not being explained but these were events that occurred before the movie and are unimportantIts hard to put into words really, just go see it!",positive
728,"Greetings again from the darkness. Any lover of movies has been anxiously awaiting this ""next film"" from James Cameron. If you have lost track of time, it's actually been 12 years since Cameron's ""Titanic"" became the ultimate mega-box office champion. Finally, people can stop asking him what he's been up to! This is a very difficult movie to review or critique, so here is how I will describe it: it is a Film spectacle ... I mean that in a good way. ""Avatar"" is an event similar to ""Star Wars"" or even ""The Exorcist"". Much anticipation for seeing something we had never before seen on screen! And make no mistake, there are MANY things in this one we have never before seen. You will not find the list here because I believe this one should be viewed with as little upfront knowledge as possible.The star of the film is not the actors, and certainly not the script, but rather the technology and special effects. Be sure to see it in 3-D, the way Mr. Cameron meant for it to be seen. Some segments are breathtaking in beauty and creativity and splashes of color. I was fascinated by Pandora, the planet where most of the action takes place. The plant life, creatures and inhabitants are truly a new world from the mind of Cameron and crew. Wow.On the downside, the story is ho-hum at best and downright cheesy in more than a few scenes. Fans will easily pick out the influence of ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", the ""Terminator"" series ... heck, even the song over the credits reminds of Celine Dion's claim to fame. Another negative is Sigourney Weaver's completely over the top and unbelievable scientist, and Giovanni Ribisi's mugging corporate puppet. Who would have even imagined the usual laconic Mr. Ribisi was capable of overacting? Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are actually very good as the leads. Especially Ms. Saldana, who emotes a wide range of emotions despite heavy make-up (an understatement), and is really the best non-technical thing about the film.In a year of terrific, accessible sci-fi (Moon, Star Trek, Avatar), this one comes up short on story, but makes up for it with awe-inspiring imagery and visuals and sound.",positive
729,"Avatar 8/10 (2 extra for visuals only)Well, what I'm going to write may not please some (maximum) but remember its MY opinion only.Everyone was waiting for this one, it was the next big thing in cinema milestone and it has landed.Seriously, mind-blowing and awesome visuals, lots of color and play of light. A very serious care has been taken for details. Imagining a whole world and then defining its details and how should it react to environment is not a easy task. Avatar gets a full 10/10 for this. Kudos to Cameron and his team for it. But, yes but...its story, what I anticipated came true. Yes guys here who watches lots of movies (The Last Samurai specially) and play a bit games (Turok may be ;-) ) already knows what this story is. And those who are just smart and guessed something about the story watching the trailers...well u guys are correct too. Its story is exactly what u thought. Old story with some meaningless (weak logic I would like to say) twists are put into it. I'm not mentioning anything here, as it would spoil ur fun, let enough people watch it, then we can start an argument over falsifying my claims. Seriously I'm not satisfied with the story and not too impressed with 3D. I didn't get the feel of it. IMO its not a right movie to watch in 3D but ya, HD obviously only for visuals. U don't go to 3D for awesome flowers or glowing octopus like weird things, u go for action which has the power to put u directly in the middle of it, makes u feel the heat. Well there are only one/two such scenes...To sum it up, Visuals=10/10 Screenplay= 5/10 (don't expect anything new, lots of loopholes and logic-less story twists/progress) Directing= 7.5/10 Cinematography=10/10Why should u see it, 1>visuals 2>visuals 3>visuals 4>visuals 5>visuals 6>N/A 7>N/A 8>N/A 9>Acting 10>Story",positive
730,"To get it out of the way, as you know, yes the visuals are incredible. OK now that this is done. The rest of the movie is a simple rehash of many other simple Hollywood movies.The problem seems to be that although the premise is very interesting, the makers of this movie did not trust the audience to make any effort of thinking about the story or moral dilemmas.The story written around the premise (new planet, indigenous people etc) has been stripped of any ""duality"" whatsoever. It has been made to be a completely one-sided blame-fest against humans. We all get it, you have to be ""green"" these days, but you don't have to make everything around it. The aliens are perfect, in harmony with the planet and burp flowers. The humans are horrible disgusting beasts bent on destruction.This would all make sense, and I would be the first to uniformly support the aliens, except This Is Not Reality. The spaghetti monster does not exist, the tooth fairy does not exist and finally ""Green Planet Magic"" does not exist. If this were the real world (or the makers of the movie grew a conscience and had the movie be more than a bubble-gum morale) the aliens would be similar to natives here on earth. Sure they would be in harmony with the planet, but they would also be stricken by many diseases killing a lot of newborns, they would be constantly at war with other clans and the list goes on.So in conclusion, it pains me to recommend seeing it in 3D in a movie theater, because aside from the graphics, this movie is quite pathetic.",positive
731,"I saw (Avatar) with my daughter a few years ago (who was 16 at the time) and was so underwhelmed I think I fell asleep. But I concluded it was a politically correct kiddy flick for high school girls with not a lot of science learning or life experience. No problem there. I put it in a similar class as Shrek but at least Shrek had enough nuances to keep an adult interested. I found Avatar to be an appalling plagiarisation of other movies and themes that were wrapped up in enhanced 3D and CGI. My daughter enjoyed it and may even think Unobtainium is a real substance.I promptly forgot Avatar until I watched Prometheus the other day and was appalled by its quality. It is not as bad as Avatar but I learned that Ridley Scott is re-making Bladerunner. Given the James Cameron/Scott connection with the Alien franchise I checked on Avatar and find it has an approval rating of 8! How can that be? I thought I had forgotten Avatar until I saw Prometheus, now I am seriously afraid. Are we going to be dictated to in terms of our cinema viewing by uneducated, vacuous, titillated audiences who would not have a clue about history, science, reality, plot and character, and intelligent entertainment? God help us. Avatar sucks as does Prometheus, and I am a huge Alien/Bladerunner/Gladiator fan. What next; the Kardashians find a cure for cancer? Unleash Hell!",negative
732,"I'm going to be frank: James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi epic ""Avatar,"" his first feature film since 1997's ""Titanic,"" is hands-down the best movie I've seen so far this year. I mean that. Prior to that, it was ""District 9."" I'm going to be even more frank: I've been pretty disappointed by the movies this year; I thought the aforementioned ""District 9"" was utterly brilliant, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is also worthy of some great mention, and so was ""Terminator Salvation."" So the question is: Was ""Avatar"" worth the 12-year wait?In a nutshell: hell yes!Let's do a run-down of the usual James Cameron trademarks:Simple, but captivating and engrossing sci-fi story - checkSimple, but well-crafted dialogue - checkGroundbreaking special effects - checkLots of appearances of the color blue - checkStrong female characters - checkEffective left-leaning social commentary - checkLiberal doses of humor - checkEvocative musical score - checkAn utterly well-crafted and damn-brilliant sci-fi film with some (some is italicized) footing in reality - check, check, and triple-check!!!The film is set in the year 2154 (note that it takes place 25 years before Cameron's own 1986 film ""Aliens"") on the distant alien moon Pandora. Pandora has since been colonized by humans, who are there looking to profit from its enormous supply of precious minerals. This has put humans at odds with the indigenous population, towering blue-skinned sentient humanoids called Na'vi, and other beautiful albeit terrifying forms of extraterrestrial life-forms. The Na'vi aren't your typical extraterrestrial primitives: they are more than a physical match for the heavily armed military forces of Earth, and they aren't going to roll over and let their home be ravaged by greedy capitalists (sounds familiar, doesn't it?).The military does have a plan: they're going to send one of their own, a paraplegic space Marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), to live amongst the Na'vi, AS A Na'vi. It turns out that the Earth scientists, led by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, of ""Aliens""), have developed the technology that has allowed them to clone perfect replicas of Na'vi beings that are inhabited by the consciousness of humans. They call these replicas ""avatars."" (In Hindu mythology, an avatar is a reincarnated deity, but can also mean a temporary representation of a person, object, or concept in a virtual world; the film deals largely with the second definition.)Being an avatar gives Sully an optimistic new outlook on his life and career, as well as a newfound sense of freedom from the confines of being a wheelchair-bound war veteran. Predictably, he is reluctantly welcomed into the Na'vi way-of-life by Neyteri (Zoe Saldana) and is thus absorbed into their culture. He comes to see for himself that they are not the primitive, violent savages that they were made out to be by his handlers, and eventually develops a love for Neyteri, her people and her world, putting his mission and loyalties to the human race at risk. And it soon becomes clear that he may very well be the only thing keeping these peaceful creatures from being exterminated by Earth's gung-ho military forces.Let me just say this movie is a phenomenon, and a continual pleasure to watch on the screen. I wasn't expecting the epic magnificence of ""Titanic,"" but I was expecting something on the scale of ""The Terminator"" (1984) - my favorite Cameron film, my favorite sci-fi film, and my #3 favorite film of all time - and ""Aliens."" (Cameron has been wise in expecting ""Avatar"" to not outdo ""Titanic."") ""Avatar"" has been Cameron's pet project since 1995, but he felt that the special effects technology of the time was not developed well enough. And we know where he went next.Cameron has always had a way with special effects in his movies: he's careful to not drown the humans, their performances, and our emotional attachments to them in endless special effects sequences. (And there are plenty of epic battle sequences to get your mouth watery, so don't worry about Cameron skimping on suspenseful action scenes.) Even though the film is done largely using highly advanced motion-capture animation techniques, the performances from Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana especially are virtually flawless, and they are able to give their computer-generated alien counterparts believable ranges of emotion that allow great sympathy toward them and their cause.I have to say that since James Cameron is my favorite director, he has done it again: he has made a movie that defies expectations and the imagination, and is yet another worthy entry into an otherwise impeccable catalog of big-budget, groundbreaking special effects-laden spectacles. I will be very displeased with the Academy Awards if ""Avatar"" does not win all of the special effects categories, because it deserves them - all of them. ""Avatar"" is filled with stunning performances, special effects and imagery so that if I'm not mistaken in my honest opinion, this is the best movie of the year.10/10",positive

738,"In the distance future, the human race have discovered a unique planet, Pandora, in which a humanoid alien species, the Na'vi, exists. A highly valuable natural resource can be harvested from Pandora, and great lengths are taken to gain some control of the planet. Jake Sully, a paraplegic war veteran, is offered the chance to take part in a mission to help communication links between humans and the Na'vi by using an 'Avatar' which resemble the Na'vi in appearance. This involves him accidentally getting into the position of getting to know the Na'vi as well as possible in order to eventually persuade them to allow the humans to extract Pandora's valuable natural resourceThere is an obvious colonialist subtext which clings to the narrative of Avatar from the film's opening minutes and this is quite possibly the most rich the narrative ever becomes with little else to provide much depth to the films essence. The story for Avatar is interesting but it is far too cluttered with linear directions on how the film should flow from one scene to the next that by the credits it feels like Avatar has accomplished very little. This is mainly due to the lack of insight provided into the world of Pandora and even the nuances of the Na'vi themselves. Both are explored purely on a foreign viewpoint and it can be argued that this works in conjunction with the world being presented by the human character of Jake, but even when he begins to fuse his being with that of the Na'vi, not much more is presented to the viewer. There is a lot going for the film but it is disappointing that more is not made of it. Another problem lies with the Na'vi themselves. Their language, voices, dress code and cultural mannerism lack any distinct criteria beyond metaphorical elaboration. The Na'vi are, simply put, a mere fantasy retelling of the indigenous tribes of Africa or even American Indians. While this does help the colonialist theme of the film and in making the narrative appear more real, it nevertheless makes the story less unique and only disregards any originality the Na'vi could have as a species. It does not come as a surprise then that the human protagonists are mainly Caucasian and the Na'vi counterparts are African or Native American.Acting is a slightly better department but the actors don't have much to work with as characters fall into defined stereotypes and the odd lines of dialogue lack consistency. Giovanni Ribisi is one of the more spirited actors but he plays a conventional power hungry executive: he becomes representative of the two-dimensional nature of the villains. Caricatures do not stop there but they are less identifiable in the heroes of the story. Worthington provides a more delicate approach to his character showing a clear distinctness in tone between his human and Na'vi selves. This does become questionable at times when even at times of unease his human self appears somewhat lackluster. Zoe Saldana is a pleasure to watch, even though she is a Na'vi, and this is purely because she is more in tune with her character than any other actor. At the end of the day, character development is on the weak side, with one character seemingly deciding to make certain decisions even when little evidence was provided for the character to do so. This also goes as far as character relationships being glazed over, even by the last third of the film where characters seem closer than originally expected.From a technical standpoint the musical score and computer generated imagery work wonders. The music definitely adds to the emotion and feel of the film heightening the more sad and courageous moments while also aiding in scene transition. The computer imagery is staggering in scope encompassing an entire environment. There is the odd scene where textures lose their realistic look but it is in the quality of the animation of characters, creatures and flora where Avatar shines.While sex is implied, there is no nudity beyond the Na'vi wearing little in terms of clothing. Language consists of mild profanities and the odd blasphemous term, while violence ranges from a variety of gunfire and stabbings among others; violence is never gory with minimal blood visible, though some acts can be a little extreme.Avatar is an ambitious film and it deserves to be so with the majestic landscape of Pandora, and her inhabitants, nearly being adequate substitutes for reality. With the well conceived musical score, Avatar has the technical factors nailed but it all falls apart when the film's core narrative is added to the mix. For all the possibilities available, the film forgoes depth for simplicity and convention. If anything, Avatar is an enjoyable film but an enjoyable film with substance that does not equate to its hype.",neutral
739,"The shear amount of technology that went into this film is enough to put anyone at awe. I was drawn into these computer generated characters more so than any other movie that I've seen before. Definitely hit every emotion between me and my daughter who also has turned into an 'Avatar' fan. A must watch. I will see this one again! Worth the movie theater price. From the beginning, you are introduced to a world, much similar to our living rain forests. My daughter and I began to correlate the similarities between the Avatar world and ours. The 3d experience puts you right in the middle, literally, enhancing the realistic cinematics in the movie. Take your older kids (10+). A few violent scenes and some interesting grown up innuendos.",positive
740,"This really could have been something special. Influential director James Cameron's first film since the mega-hit 'Titanic'. 12 years of waiting, in part so that the technology was advanced enough for the film to be made. The man who gave us Sci-Fi classics like 'The Terminator', 'T2: Judgement Day' and 'Aliens' giving us his most ambitious piece yet. But for all its visual grandeur, its technical marvel, its fine detail, Avatar ends up being a disheartening failure. Why? Because it makes the fatal mistake of completely ignoring the two things that are crucial in any film, story and character.The film follows paraplegic marine Jake Sully as he takes the place of his deceased brother on the avatar project. Based on the distant planet Pandora, the project involves controlling a body of the natives (known as the Na'vi) in order to gather information about them. Well so far so good, there's at least some creativity. All that disappears quickly. We learn that the military and business tycoons are there to take a valuable material called Unobtainium (oh how do they come up with this stuff). I'm so sick of these lazy plots that have suits taking what isn't there's. We get the message they're hammering us with, leave the indigenous people and their land alone. Of course Jake is persuaded by Colonel Quaritch to deliver information and secrets about the Na'vi directly to him so he can figure out their weakness in exchange for the spinal surgery Jake needs.But wait a second, something incredible happens. The more time Jake absorbs the Na'vi's culture, the more he grows to love its people and begins to doubt whether or not he can turn on them. Well I've never seen that before. Oh wait, I have in 'Dances with Wolves', 'Pocahontas' and 'The Last Samurai' to name but a few. It is exactly the same story as all of these. It has the same set-up, it follows the same beats, it has the same character motivations, and it even has the same preachy moral lesson. The white man comes to conquer, but the main character can't fight against the culture he initially dislikes but grows to care for. There is not a single moment in the film where I didn't know what was going to happen next. For all the money spent why couldn't they write a better story?Throughout all this Jake develops a relationship with a Na'vi called Neytiri and it is literally there just to serve the plot. These two share absolutely no chemistry. There isn't even a reason for them to like each other. The only reason Neytiri changes her mind is because some kind of sprite lands on him and that's a sign that he has a good heart. Sadly the film is littered with convenient and mystical hogwash like that which is never looked at in any detail. It's fair enough that the film has its own mythology, but at least try to give some meaning. The film suffers badly from lack of explanation. Like why are the military so fixed on destroying the planet to gain the material when it's clear that the Na'vi can be befriended with relative ease? It is basically because we need some villains and those mean humans will do just fine. The only thing as one-note as the story are the characters. Sam Worthington's agent deserves a medal for getting one of the blandest, most expressionless, cardboard cut-out actors ever to grace the screen to helm a film of this magnitude. It boggles my mind as to how insipid an actor he is. Jake as a character isn't very interesting but there are countless actors who could of at least brought something to the role. Zoe Saldana suffers too, but that's mainly because Neytiri is a totally unlikeable and irritating character. You even have good actors like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang wasted in clichéd roles as the plucky scientist and the colonel blinded by stupidity. In a film like this we need characters that are either relatable or interesting in order to keep them from being swamped. You'd think Cameron of all people would know this. What I can't discount is just how visually stunning the film is. The world created is something we've seen before, but the detail and vibrancy really is something to behold. This film is gorgeous. The textures, the colour scheme, the shades of light, the environment of Pandora, it all looks pretty incredible and I can see why it took so long to craft. The CGI both stands out on its own and blends with the live-action seamlessly. The Na'vi's design is a bit conventional, but again the detail gone into creating them is there for all to see. The visuals truly are the films only outstanding feature. The same can't be said of the action sequences even though they're are decently staged and can get suitably intense, they're nowhere near as imaginative or gripping as they could have been. That's partly because you don't care who lives or dies.James Cameron did something here that I struggle to understand. He made a film with such creative potential and possibilities safe. Something that is a boring and hollow experience. Something that is so reliant on its visual brilliance that without it there is nothing to offer. How could someone as talented as Cameron create a story that is so cliché riddled and unengaging? In many ways the film's success is disappointing. It's telling filmmakers that we want more films where the stories and characters can be as basic as possible as long as we get some impressive visuals, where we value style over substance. I want style, but I also want a film that I can be invested in and where I care about what happens. Avatar failed to provide this on any level.",negative
741,"Avatar is a piece of art. The shots are so rich and the detail is shock and awe. The avatars or the blue people are so real, nothing done like before (Gollum is history). The movie takes us into a new world, with all kinds of wild life and surroundings. Unbelievable how much the CGI looks real. There isn't a shot in the movie where you can say that was badly done (at least i didn't see it after my first viewing - yes i plan to see it again very soon :) This is truly the new Star Wars in term of technology. Visually, wow. The story on the other hand has already been told many times. Its a mixture of Dances with Wolves, The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner (the off speech) etc. but done in a new way. The acting is great by all the cast. Zoe Saldana stands out and Sam Worthington is great too. They clicked. I loved the movie and cant wait for James' new project Battle Angel.I m so thankful to be living in the same time as James Cameron. He has made such great movies which I have watched over and over again (Terminator, Aliens, Abyss, True Lies, Titanic etc). He hasn't made a bad or mediocre movie. He is a genius.Go see it and for about 3 hours forget all your troubles and all of your cares in a new world. The ticket is worth every penny.And the Oscar goes to...........Avatar :)",positive
742,"I'm not a fan of James Cameron.He did Aliens 2, but Aliens 1 - the original made by Ridley Scott - was by far the best of the series. The Alien 2 was a big battle against Aliens with as only spot the fight of 2 Mother for the little kid (the Alien Queen against Ripley). Otherwise some good special effects at this time but no real innovation. I was disappointed.OK he did Abyss, and I remember that everyone was saying WOW about the creature made in water. Now it is just a boring movie to see, all the special Fx looks dated and the script has no originality... disappointing.He did True Lies... Mrs and Mr Smith is just 1000 times better. Have you seen True Lies lately? Arnold sucks, and the movie is a classic Hollywood crappy action movie... B style. Really disappointing...Well he did Titanic, a beautiful romance with a good scripts that surfs on the publics feelings like a Dolphin, helped by the Celine Dion song and James Horner's excellent score. I loved this movie and that's the only movie I consider to be a Masterpiece in James Cameron's career.Why everyone thinks that Cameron created the Alien series (he did only the Number 2), or the Terminator series (he did only the number 2 as well). James Cameron has been always the Number 2, the sequel specialist, or a blockbuster maker with no originality.Where is the magic in Avatar? I didn't cried like in Titanic, I didn't worried about the kid like in Alien 2, I didn't liked the script like in Terminator 2...But if you think about what this movie represents, after seeing it in 3D, and in regard of what the cinema is in 2009, this movie is as powerful as was the 9th Beethoven Symphony when it was first played in Vienna in 1824.There are a lot of good movies, but how many movies are such a step in the future, such a visual firework, such an emotional roller-coaster and such a beautiful soul and message, connected so deeply with our time all together? James Cameron put in this movie all the best of what we can expect from the cinema industry in 2009, but 20 years ahead of his time.That's in my opinion the mark of a genius, a visionary like Orson Wells or Jules Verne. He absorbed our time and made a beautiful tale that touch your heart, while using the most advanced technology. His mastering as a director is unbelievable. At the end, when the 3d and the 2d meets together, you take a slap in the face like never before.Cameron is at the top of his art and being a witness of this is an extraordinary feeling. Avatar is unique, an impossible to describe experience, and a milestone for the centuries to come...",positive
743,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, actually make that the best. It has stunning graphics, you must see it in 3D.Very good acting from everyone and excellent directing from James.This will be another blockbuster and I recommend it to everyone.There is almost nothing wrong with this movie, everything you see is believable.The fights are intense and James obviously has a wide imagination as the creatures on Pandora aren't your usual aliens.Just like Titanic, this will be another gigantic movie. Trust that Cameron can deliver. Go and watch it, it will be the best movie you will ever see!",positive
744,"I loved Avatar. It was many different kinds of movies blended into one. There was love, unity, a love of nature, sorrow, happiness, honor, spirituality, and much more. I loved watching this movie. It was very well done. I would guess that a director's wish for viewers to leave the theaters wishing they were in a reality of the movie they just watched. Avatar was certainly a movie that could accomplish that. The movie inspired great emotion and was revolutionary on how people could think of our world and lives. The movie was unique in a brilliant way to say the least. I didn't watch it in IMAX but I certainly would like to after watching it the first time. Even though it's still in theaters I wish it was out on DVD since I can't experience that ""part of the movie reality"" life. =(. Basically, I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",positive
745,"With apologies to the great coach.but it does seem that visual is the only thing in Avatar, given a plot that is simplicity itself and the un-subtlety of the allegory and messages. Even with the credible performance of a good cast, I find the overwhelming reaction (audience and critics alike) somewhat puzzling. Roger Ebert's comparison of the ""new language"" to that in LOTR, in addition to demonstrating the gentleman's total ignorance, tantamount to an unforgivable insult to J.R.R. Tolkien.First, on the visual, after watching ""Beowulf"" (2007), I was filled with absolute detestation at an abomination called ""motion capture"". The outright rude transformation of an actor's real performance into an animation on screen is a technology-spawn sin that is surpassed by only one thing in human history – the atomic bomb. The obscenely glossy figures in that movie were positively vomit-inducing. That alone almost kept me away from Avatar. I am happy to say, however, that the motion captured characters therein are quite acceptable, partly because Cameron commands a better technology and partly because the motion captured characters are from an alien culture and therefore not expected to look exactly like the human race. The 3D effect, on the other hand, is no more than an excuse to make me pay double for my ticket. Having seen what REAL 3D is supposed to be like, some 30 years ago, at the EPCOT when it first opened, I have found everything that I've seen since with that label nothing more then mere child's play. Avatar is no exception.The sci-fi basis for this movie is conceptually simple, especially if you have seen ""Surrogate"" (2008). When a protagonist is put into a state of deep sleep in a not-too-sophisticated-looking device, his mind embodies a surrogate body, going about whatever business at hand. The only difference is that here in Avatar, the surrogate body is from an alien culture resembling, in appearance, human in some ways but not others. What follows are familiar plot elements: assimilation of an individual into a new culture, a cross-culture love story, heroic uprising against oppressors.The cast is well chosen and performs well. Sam Worthington coming off ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) plays a relatively younger hero, especially in his alien persona, one of his two roles. Unlike Worthington, Zoe Saldana his female co-lead has only one identity, the passionate daughter of the alien chief. Those who have seen how beautiful she was in ""Vantage point"" (2008) will be happy to know that even under the entirely alien appearance, her beauty is not lost. Sigourney Weaver (who happens to have also appeared in ""Vantage point"") is a welcome addition to any cast. Personally, I am most happy to see my favourite Giovanni Ribisi, prolific actor and best remembered acting opposite Cate Blanchett in ""Heaven"" (2002). He plays a scientist rudely awaken to the reality that science is not the only thing, not just an end in itself. Stephen Land and Michelle Rodriguez complete the very respectable cast.Avatar is a good movie, but not a great one.",neutral
746,"I was quite impressed with the audio/visual aspects of the film, the creatures and scenery, but I was really let down by the story. I mean it sort of had a ""The New World"" feel to it in my eyes (which I liked) but the characters never got the chance to develop very far, and seemed to get lost in the physical action. The ex-Colonel was as shallow a meat-head as they come, and it seemed a little contrived how far he went with his vendetta against the Na'vi. I guess it does make more sense if you realize that they are contractors, not military, and have a mercenary mindset.Overall, my greatest satisfaction was in seeing that the animated characters displayed excellently the actors' facial expressions and gestures. My biggest fear was that (as in many CG films) the characters would have action figure syndrome, and look goofy. However, I found that it wasn't hard not only to sympathize with, but to actually feel an attachment to these characters who were completely animated and not even human.",positive
747,"It is quite clear that u cant walk in the cinema expecting this movie to be all about the art . You cannot expect the best dialogs , the best story . Its like walking into a Ferrari and criticizing the hard suspension and small space . This is a movie made to entertain , it is 3 hours of pure spectacle and emotion . I have to be honest , I wasn't expecting much more than great CGI. But I was surprised . The story while not original works , the acting while not the greatest works too . The recipe made of some simple ingredients and 2 exotic ones , namely the CGI and the 3D , is mind blowing .This a movie that will define adventure for the years to come . The world of Pandora (which like the box promises everything but delivers nothing to all but a few) is incredibly real , the facial expressions of the digital actors flawless. The fauna and flora so convincing you believe its real yet so alien , a masters vision of a strange world that may be . Cameron put the notes in the right order , and a symphony , a masterpiece of entertainment is made .Let yourself be carried away to his vision , to the incredible world of Pandora , and 3 hours of adventure like no other is yours .",positive
748,"OK... from the very outset let me set the record straight by saying that Avatar is a visual feast with the highest production values thanks to it's titanic(pardon the pun) budget. Yes it's reinvented the way movies will be made from hereon (judging by the nos of flicks that are being made in 3D) but I really don't know what the fuss is all about. I can understand people going gaga over it's visuals but isn't that a case of overly stating the worth of something based on face value alone? OK i will not delve into the plot and other details pertaining to the movie itself cuz to be honest this yarn has been done a million times before. Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves come to mind instantly and in terms of bettering such efforts, Avatar succeeds admirably. The photography, editing and F/X (both visual and sound) are top notch and the overall effect is mind blowing but there really isn't a lot to write home about apart from it's technical brilliance. That's not to say that Avatar sucks in the acting and storytelling department but what i mean to say is that there really is nothing to warrant any greatness and thus claim a place in the highest echelons of modern movie-making alongside movies like Fight Club,Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction.The most telling point is the fact that I really don't see a plausible reason as to why anyone would want to indulge in repeated viewings of this movie (unless of course to drool over the visuals). Another parameter I use to judge a movie's greatness is the lasting effect it has after a viewing and Avatar fails miserably in the department. I don't mean to say that the emotional quotient is no-existent but it feels clichéd and forced. Add to that the movie is so predictable and means that there's no intrigue which for me is a requisite in order to satisfyingly view a movie. The lack of suspense was very frustrating and I couldn't help but feel 'here we go again!!!!' All in all, it's no doubt that Avatar is a technically brilliant piece of cinema but leaves the rest to be desired due to the lack of creativity in the departments of cinema a true lover of movies would still hold as indicators of greatness (i.e acting, dialogue, screenplay). Time will tell just how great a movie Avatar really is after the whole juggernaut of 3D fades and when it has to measured upto true great James Cameron movies like Terminator and Aliens (based on merit alone). Remember how everyone was blown away by Titanic at the beginning and thirteen years on it's prob a marginally better movie than 2012??? well whether Avatar meets the same fate is for us to find out:)",positive
749,My Rating : 9/10Avatar is outstanding. I don't think I had seen a more visually beautiful film up until Avatar. This was back in 2009 and I had watched it in 3D and I was completely blown away by the visuals. This probably is the best 3D movie I've ever seen. Check it out. I simply don't understand how some people have given it a low rating. This is top notch movie-watching experience.,positive
750,"When I heard that it took like 14 years for this movie to be made, my first thought was that I had to see this movie. If it took more than two years I'd expect the movie to be a masterpiece. I finally did see it last week with a few of my friends. The animation for this film was spectacular, from beginning to end I was amazed on how well done everything looked. The movie itself I wasn't too fond of. When I saw that Neytiri didn't kill Jake Sully at the beginning, I already knew what was going to happen throughout the whole movie. My final conclusion is that the movie could have been better. Without the extremely well done animation the movie wouldn't have been that great and I would have rated it around a 4, and with it I rate it a 7.",positive
751,"While anticipating for the long-awaited sequel The Way of Water, it was time to look back on the 2009 movie by James Cameron. I never did watch Avatar in theaters those years ago and was about to graduate college around that time when it opened to rave reviews and earned its accolades. I went to watch the re-release of it to see what made this THE film to be the largest grossing movie in cinematic history. While I can say that it's a far from perfect movie with a story that sounds familiar, it proved to be a visual and emotional spectacle that stretched beyond my own imagination. Through the use of live-action blended with motion capture using tech that was both innovative and unheard of at the time, the equipment in help bringing this world and characters to life left me intrigued. As though you're focused on one thing that you'll eventually disregard the difference of what is real or not.In the year 2154, a paraplegic soldier named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited and jettisoned to the planet of Pandora to test out the latest technology that would allow him the use of his legs again. With the help of scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), his consciousness is transferred into the body of an avatar (as scientists call them the Na'vi). There, he learns how to be on the front lines again and at the same time falling in love with a native Na'vi named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Of course, conflicting notions of what really matters begin to arise from there in this strange, new environment millions of miles away from Earth.Granted, there are so many similarities to past films that ventured into this kind of territory. Whereas on a side note, I also took notice of a particular children's book among Dr. Augustine's work station called ""The Lorax."" If anyone read that Dr. Seuss book, that could foreshadow of what's to come before the climax. The point is these concepts involving greed and the consequences of deforestation were explored much differently and was assembled to be its own movie, whether the filmmakers are aware of the similarities or not. James Cameron's library of films are without a doubt an eye-catcher that has an impressive ensemble cast and for Avatar to be paired with the music of the great composer James Horner? Makes it feel more engaging and enthralling. Reunited since 1997's Titanic. Overall, this is a sci-fi adventure flick that I think made its mark as noteworthy. A fun, immersive ride done by a renowned filmmaker.",positive
752,"The technical achievement is impressive, and it's worth watching for that alone. The concept is extremely foreign, but somehow, it just works. The plot says a lot about the real world. Truly a gripping story.",positive
753,"It certainly is one of the most visually impressive films ever made. The special effects are amazing. The imagination used in the visual effects is incredible. James Cameron has crafted such an impressive film to look at, so why could he not have used this gift to create a screenplay that was more original, that had more depth and that wasn't so predictable? It's still a good story and the film is enormously entertaining, but the script prevents it from achieving that level of greatness that would distinguish it as a truly landmark film. Great score, the art direction and cinematography are superb. It's certainly memorable and good performances from everyone.",positive
754,Of course the special effects are mind-blowing even on the little 16 inch computer screen i saw this film on. But the story is very much by the numbers. Another good guys versus bad guys story with no shades of gray. The Navi are all good and just about all the humans are bad. It reminds me of Star Wars from 30 years ago in how the story just doesn't grab you.Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver have big parts but i didn't care for either of them. Both came across as boring liberal do-gooders. Steven Lang is great as the bad guy colonel. The girl who played Trudy was a real pain. Why does every action movie have to have a girl who tries to be just as macho as the men? Just more feminist propaganda and very irritating.Still i did enjoy the movie.,neutral
755,"I waited for 30 minutes in the morning to watch Avatar and it was worth the wait. Avatar was a spectacular and heart-warming journey about a battle between the humans and the natives. Watching it in 3D enhanced the visuals, and I have to admit, they were perfect. The story line was great - a bit shaky at the start - but was later explained throughout the movie. It really is emotional at the end when you see many of the natives dying to protect their land and you really want them to survive. It has a few humorous lines though it is more of a fantasy/drama/adventure movie. The audio was also great, especially with all the strange new creatures discovered. I don't want to spoil the movie, but this is the best movie I have ever seen in a long time and a long time to come. James Cameron, yet again, has made another fantastic and spell binding movie from his previous success, ""Titanic"" which was another movie that made a mark in my heart. Audio, Visuals, Storyline, Actors perfect - this is the must see movie of the century.",positive
756,"James Cameron; what a chance you had here.When I saw the reviews praising this as a piece of brilliance, I thought I had to see it. I didn't watch it for a while, but eventually got round to putting it on and seeing what all the fuss was about. It probably didn't help that my expectations were so high, but I was so disappointed by what I saw. I really wanted and tried to like this film, but I couldn't.To start with, the film is incredibly long. It's such a needless length for a film that is really quite basic in it's plot and story. After an hour and a half I was watching the clock tick down, and then it drags on for another hour or so. It doesn't need to be that long. It almost feels like when you write an essay or do a piece of homework and you need to get to a word count, but you're 500 words short. So you just waffle about everything and anything that you can think of. That's very much what this movie is.Don't get me wrong, it's visually stunning. If you get a chance to watch it in HD or 3D, then please do because it does make a massive difference. The world in which it takes place in is a real quality piece of animation and it is the high point of the movie. The only problem is that, after a while, it starts feeling like it's boasting and becoming complacent. You see the visuals and you think ""wow!"". Then you're an hour in and you've got over the visuals and you're looking for something more. You just don't get it. There's nothing more to give, and it just becomes a bit like it's constantly reminding you how good it looks, and it does look great. When the credits roll, it should be that you can't stop thinking and talking about the quality of the visuals but, instead, you end up not appreciating them as you should, and would, in any other film that looks as stunning as this does.Because the film is 160 minutes long, it's hard to remain interested in the plot and storyline. It feels like it's a chore to watch. I think one of it's flaws is that it doesn't seem to have a genre nailed down. Is it a romance? Is it action? Is it fantasy? In the end, it mashes it all together and feels like it's lost in this mystical world. Many films get away with not focusing on a specific criteria, but this one is so bold in how it tries to display the movie, that it feels like it could do with just picking one or two (at a push) and focusing entirely on that. One of it's major strengths is the peaceful nature of the setting, but the end action sequence (which seems to go on for an eternity) ruins that feeling and overshadows any depth the film has. Don't get me wrong, I like action. It just doesn't belong in a film like this, certainly not for that length of time.And the blue individuals just don't quite do it for me. They look strangely animated to start with, and there's something missing. It's almost too simplistic for everything else the film stands for. They don't appear complex enough as people or in appearance. The main character is a bit emotionless. I don't know if it's his voice or not but he doesn't feel like he has enough substance.Musically it's good. It coincides with scenes to give you that powerful feeling and, again, reminds you that you should be impressed by how it looks. It acts almost as a prompt for when you should go ""yeah, that bit is cool"".There is a good film in there, but it's just been mashed up a bit too much. The length makes it hard to retain focus on such a predictable plot and you don't end up caring or hating any of the characters. If it had been a bit shorter (maybe 90-105 minutes), it may have been better and I might have clicked with it more. The expectation probably didn't help either, I'll admit. It thinks it can get by on how good it looks but it can't. It needs something more than that, but doesn't find it. It's a shame.It was just a visually stunning disappointment for me, which goes on so long you forget what happened in the first half an hour, and don't really care that you can't remember.It was a fraction short of being an 8/10, for me, but it fell short for trying too much at once.",neutral
757,"I watched this yesterday and wow i am still amazed by it the next day. The story is so brilliant, makes you feel inside the movie itself, even more so in 3D. Buying the game at this moment as that has also got great reviews. There isn't anything better that you could spend £5 on, pretty much anyone would love this film, cant fault any of it; scenery is beautiful, makes me want to live there (apart from the vicious animals). In the same day i also watched Stardust on DVD which the first time i watched it i found to be a very good movie, however maybe it was because i had already watched it or maybe it was because it was only on DVD but after watching avatar just hours before it was like watching an old 90s film, not a scratch off of avatar.

I really don't see what the big deal is, sure it was colorful and for some reason I liked the jellyfish looking things floating around. Maybe if I saw it back in 2009 when it was released it may have made a bigger impression. But, I don't understand all the people rating it a 10 and saying it's the best movie ever, I'm thinking they had a part in making the movie. I'm not sure I'll watch the 2nd one (that was released in 2022) anytime soon, geez it says that it's even longer.",neutral
759,"Avatar is a five-out-of-ten-star film. Not bad, but not excellent by any means.Avatar fails for several reasons: 1) It's a Vietnam film (albeit with a SF bent), many many years too late. The Vietnam film started with ""Apocalypse Now"" and finished with ""Full Metal Jacket"", and the canon includes everything in between. There was no reason to rehash it and nothing has been achieved by doing so. Cameron adds nothing to the Vietnam genre, nor the SF world.2) Despite the nice (but only ""nice"") backstory that exists for the Na'Vi and the white Americans (who represent all human beings, of course), the story itself is dull, predictable and not worth the time it takes to tell (some /ten-star/ reviews on IMDb even knowledge this - nuts!) In fact, story-wise it's a very expensive b-movie. The characters are unsympathetic (white knucklehead soldier has coming of age experience with foreign land/culture/woman; James Cameron forces another woman (or the same woman, for the second time) into a man's costume/role/story arc), and there are few surprises or story developments to reward our patience. The casting is also very woolly - Worthington, like his character, is expendible, Weaver chews scenery and channels too much Ripley, Rodriguez is rubbish /again/, and Lang is almost cartoonish (although, in many ways his performance sits the most comfortably).3) The Na'Vi are irritatingly orientalist. They are a quite unsubtle blend of the United States' lack of understanding of Asian and African cultures. While Sam Worthington's blundering has a certain quality of self-reflexiveness, ultimately, the Na'vi culture is a collection of ""preconceived archetypes which envision all 'Eastern' societies as fundamentally similar to one another, and fundamentally dissimilar to 'Western' societies."" 4) The digital looks crappy, even (especially?) in 3D. The neon green/blue palette does for cinema what it does for cars - makes it look falsely flash and after a while it reveals its shallowness. Also, the Na'Vi feel false, wooden, despite their 3D Mo-Cap yadda-yadda technology. Sorry, but Jim Henson's stuff still feels exponentially more real than this simply because the things captured by the camera WERE REAL! I would compare Avatar to the Hammer film ""One Million Years BC"": essentially a good b-movie with effects that are impressive but definitely ""of their time"", making the film itself a curio of the same.I predict that this will be James Cameron's greatest flop, dollar-for-dollar, soundbite-for-soundbite.

The problem with these movies is that no matter what the director did or how well developed the plot was, they could never fully capture you and make you feel like you were a part of the movie; fortunately, James Cameron's Avatar 3D does just that. With state of the art animation and effects and a reported budget of nearly half a billion dollars, this movie has all the bells and whistles to make this movie a heart pounding, jaw dropping extravaganza of epic proportions, not to mention the story line which compliments the cinematography perfectly. All in all, it looks like James Cameron has captured the hearts of yet another generation of movie goers.",positive

Sigourney shows a little 'acting' in the movie and the new-comer Worthington is pure raw and the poor guy needs more acting lessons! The rest of the cast grunts and howls through the entire movie (in faceless alien gear) and the three hours is just one special effects after another. One wonders if, instead of Cameron, the computer nerds behind the zany special effects, should have been nominated for all the awards. This plot has been done at least 20 times in the past, and there was absolutely no credible acting in the movie. Some of the scenes were drawn out to an extent, where you will feel like snoozing. Other than the spectacular cinematography, the movie has little to offer. Wait till it comes out in DVD, then enjoy 3 hours of action/sci-fi garbage with your 10 yr-old.

I knew there would be special effect, CGI and all in all an amazing world created. And the visuals were great, there is no question about it. But the film simply failed to capture me! And it is simply because... well what else is there in this film? It is not original or at least creative. The acting is at best average, not one single actor delivers anything close to a good/great performance. The involved characters are also very one-dimensional, uninteresting and completely lacked complexity. The dialogues are not even trying to be remotely good. Was it all just written in a hurry? The story is very thin and unoriginal. Blue Indians living in space, getting pillaged by man. This isn't even close to being something new. The plot is very thin. I also found it quite uninteresting.The film was furthermore unnecessarily long, it could easily have been shortened. It did bore me, and I did not expect that to happen. As mentioned already, I did not have high expectations. All in all, take away the good looks, and the film really is poor. I do not expect very much from films of this type or pure action movies, but there has to be some quality in acting, the script, story, dialogue, complexity, depth... This film has nothing except for the visuals! The moral and story has been done way better is numerous film titles. Except, the people will not be blue or made with CGI.Very disappointing, unless looks are the only thing counting for you! Hollywood we know has this view. But it is scary to see that so extremely many share it.6 stars - and as you have understood by now, it is almost purely based on the effects and visuals.",neutral
767,"And it holds up so well to this day, I don't think I have seen a better looking film to this day! It was an absolute treat rewatching this in 3D in the biggest Imax theater my city has. In my opinion, this is probably the best use of 3D in any movie. All those copy cat movies that came after it in 2009 were just gimmicks in comparison. I never got a chance to watch this film in a theater when it originally released, and so I never appreciated it as much. But now that I am older and I can understand the emotional beats better too, I have redeemed myself.The world building in the first half of the movie frequently gave me goosebumps. So much detail and so elegantly imagined! James Cameron and his whole team are freaking geniuses! I even loved the interactions and dynamics between all the humans when they aren't exploring that gorgeous forest. Great dialog and excellent pacing considering that the movie clocks in at just under 3 hours. My only minor gripe was that I felt the war sequences in the second half went on for a bit too long. But the action was so brilliantly designed and emotionally engaging that I can look over it. Combined with the underlying anti-imperialist messages, this is probably the most stunning spectacle put to screen! Imax and 3D were literally built for this! Take a bow James Cameron!",positive
768,"In terms of the visual department, Avatar is a pleasure to watch. It is an achievement and it rightfully got the Oscar. This is the only reason - and by all means a sufficient one - to go to the theatre. The overall story is also relatively believable although surely not original. However, given the investment this movie got, the huge potential was only partly realised. And why? Because at some point they forgot they were making a movie, not a CGI demo. The dialogues are so annoying, childish and empty, it makes sitting through the movie with the sound on a real challenge. I don't want to hear exclamations of 10-year olds if I'm to get interested in the plot. I don't want to be force fed what's going on, I don't want one dimensional characters and so little respect for the intelligence of the audience.So I have to admit very mixed feelings on recommending this movie. The reality is, you cannot miss Avatar, since it sets today's standard in visual effects. But please, do not have any more expectations than that, or you will be disappointed.",neutral
769,"Yes, that's right: Garbage.If you think special effects and action sequences can make up for tepid acting and a lousy script, then you'll like Avatar.If you enjoy watching an arrogant, unimaginative hack director pretend to be creative, then you'll LOVE watching James Cameron regurgitate tired old clichés on a screen. You may even want to help inflate his ego even more (as if he needs any more of it) by perpetuating all the hype and blather about how he ""reinvented"" movies -- just don't mention that you're using ""reinventing"" as a synonym for ""ripping off other people's ideas,"" because Jimbo doesn't like being reminded of that.Are you one of those tree-huggers who thinks ""Nature"" is perfect, and that humans somehow aren't part of it? Do you think that primitive tribal societies are somehow better than industrialized ones? If so, then you'll absolutely adore this obnoxious, preachy, heavy-handed, anti-humanity morality play. Hell, you may even want to paint yourself blue and start a cult.Just hold off on your sermonizing about how marvelous it is to live ""in harmony with Nature"" until AFTER you shut off all your electricity and plumbing -- and then sell your car, and everything else you own that was produced in a factory. Because until you DO that, you'll be as big a hypocrite as James Cameron.",negative
770,"This is one of the few movies that I have actually paid to see in a cinema more than twice, that for me says something about how good I think it is.The first time I saw this move I sat in a row very close to the screen and it was in 3D. It blew me away. This was the cinema release which was 162 minutes long. It felt like 5 minutes and held my attention from start to finish. I came back the next day and sat through it again, this time a little further back and again in 3D. After about a 3 hour break for lunch and other activities I came back to the cinema and watched it again, this time in 2D. All three times the movie was 162 minutes long and each time it felt like no time at all. My immediate rating after each viewing was 8/10.Months later this came out on Blu Ray with the extended cut available at 178 minutes. 16 whole extra minutes added, wow, so cool were my thoughts before watching it. After I had watched the extended cut the first time my immediate rating was 10/10, those 16 minutes for me changed the whole movie and made it so much better.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Wes Studi and CCH Pounder, just a few of the name actors in this masterpiece and they all contribute and add to the experience of a great movie.James Cameron hit the ball out of the park with this one as far as I am concerned. I loved Titanic, but this just goes to the next level. Probably the best movie I have ever had the privilege of watching many many times.This movie has everything, action, romance, drama and comedy. Anyone who did not see the funny moments must not have watched the same movie.If you haven't ever seen this movie yet, get the extended cut copy and view it, avoid any other copy, you will not be disappointed.",positive

He wasn't even born yet, when Avatar was released and he is a big fan of the movie, he watched it at least five times before at home. I'm happy that I was able to show him the movie as it should be watched. It was an amazing and also emotional experience. Thank you, James Cameron.And don't run out of the theater after the movie ends, because after few minutes of credits, new short sequence of Avatar 2 is shown.

773,"I watch an average of 5 movies a week, some in cinema some not. So that makes about 250 movies a year, been watching for 4 years actively. As a side note; I got laid thanks to this movie, the romance part is ideal for surprise kiss... (tip,tip)Avatar 3D got into my top 10 list of all time movies, not only because of visual aspects but ALSO because of its breathtaking action and storyline. I have .. never seen any movie with a similar plot. Sure there are a scene or two which could have been written better, but I can say that for every single movie. And that doesn't make a movie bad.Many people claim that it is clichéd, got bad musics.. predictable etc.My answer: - Predictable it is in some parts, but that is a GOOD thing, you can expect something great to happen and when it happens it is more breathtaking than when something happened you did not predict and causes you to miss it. There are a lot of twists in plot you do not predict! In fact, I have been watching it now 3 times in cinema and I still find new stuff to spot and still don't remember the whole plot. I know how it began and how it ended, but middle is quite blurry which gives the movie a good re-watch status.Musics are fine, sure those could be better but when I watched my third time this in cinema not even then did I focus on the music's quality. It is good, not bad, not the best.Clichéd.. Nah. Only thing I recognized as cliché was the survivability in the end and the part where the romance began. Other than that, people have to point me out those clichés they claim there to be as I didn't notice.Something bad about movie is that not every computer generated scene were .. how to say, polished to the end. Some were blurry and in general FPS lagged behind my eyes so I managed to notice this is not real but since I work with 3D drawing every day I have more eye for mistakes than most but to consider more than 2 hours of this movie is partially computer enhanced things are pretty damn impressive. They should have finished it up tho so -0.2 points for that.9.8 in total. (-0.2 came from graphics and I never give 10)Conclusion: Great movie, go and donate. Shines when watched in 3D. Small flaws that can be accepted.",positive

775,"Avatar is a stunning achievement, the definitive big-screen event of our generation. Words seem hopelessly inadequate to try and capture its spectacular three-dimensional glory, but suffice it to say that it sucks you in and immerses you smack bang into a whole new world, giving you a cinematic experience so god damned rich it becomes impossible to assess it as a mere movie. Watch this, and watch it in 3D. Trust me. I watched the 3D version yesterday and I was spellbound during the entire movie. This is a tale of love. Of greed. Of dreams. Of people. Of mercy. Of vengeance. Of faith. This is a tale of life, and it genuinely gives you the taste of a whole new one. The themes are simple but the mythology is deceptively nuanced, and one never expected the most expensive film in the history of cinema to be subtle in any way.",positive
776,"As people have already said, it's visually one of the best movies ever created. It definitely gets a 10/10 in that department. (Fantastic) I won't lie by saying I enjoyed this movie as a popcorn flick, however, how it unfolds the plot was where it suffered. There seems to be underdeveloped parts to the movie that keeps it from being a modern classic. The ending especially feels forced to create political propaganda about the Native Americans. So a 4/10 for the plot. (Weak) Overall, this could've been the best movie we've all seen in years but unfortunately, the plot keeps it from getting that title. It gets a 7/10 for my rating. (Good)",positive
777,"As of today, there are 2675 reviews for ""Avatar""--many of them excellent and by reviewers I respect and enjoy. Because this film has been reviewed so many times and I am so late in seeing it, I will make review VERY quick, as there isn't a whole lot more I can say that hasn't already been said.Although I have almost 10000 reviews to my credit (making me a real nut-case!), I rarely ever see blockbuster films. Heck, I've never seen ""Jurassic Park"" and I mostly only go to theaters to see movies my daughters want to see or the Oscar-nominated shorts that are shown each winter. So the fact that I never saw ""Avatar"" in the theaters isn't very surprising. Any why, then, did I see the film? Well, Netflix (or more likely the Post Office) made a mistake!! I was supposed to watch an Ealing Studios comedy (just the sort of thing a film snob would adore) but the package was ripped open--and ""Avatar"" was inside! While I should have seen it in 3-D on a huge screen, I fortunately at least saw it on a 58"" TV---the best I could hope for instead of the theater. In fact, I would say that if you only have a small TV, don't even bother as the graphics are the big reason to see the film--not the story. Additionally, James Cameron achieved something never achieved before (and hopefully which can now be achieved again thanks to CGI)--he's made sci-fi no longer the realm of humans or human-like beings. So much of the world in this film is 100% alien--something common in books but NEVER on TV or in films. Because of these factors, the film MUST be seen--even if the story, unfortunately, is a bit simplistic with its 'people are stupid and lack TRUE insight' plot. I would have liked the aliens teaching the humans much (like they did in the film) but less of the 'noble savage' idea that people have nothing to offer in exchange. While I do agree people are sometimes stupid, it just seemed a bit too black & white in its thinking and, as a result, lacks depth when it comes to the otherwise fascinating story. For example, the boss-man in charge of the operation comes off as a walking stereotype--like G.I. Joe on steroids and not a real person.Excellent...but flawed. Next time (and the director has announced there will be at least two follow-up films), I sure hope they spend some more of the one hundred bazillion dollar budget on better writing--as the characters were too often one-dimensional and the macho fight at the end just seemed...well...stupid and clich√©d. More well-rounded and real and I would have given this film a 10--perhaps the next ones will earn this distinction.",positive
778,"Avatar is a 3D benchmark program married to an early script of Pochahontas. It's a Walt Disney movie and the way it is colorful and fun only underlines the fact how lucrative it is designed to be. The story is about war and extinction, stuff like that is not colorful and fun. Yes, it is a wonder of computer technology, but technological wonders happen every day, just look at your 50 gigs pendrive smaller then your thumbnail, since when do we credit that as art? I do not find avatar a particularly bad movie, but as a general piece of filmmaking it is not worth more praise than a worse Disney vehicle and the way it now forces cinema to convert to a 3D entertainment park is not something I regard as a benefit to the world.",neutral
779,"Watching on my computer, I realize that the direction and the way the story unfolds is really really terrible. The characters are very shallow, and there are a lot of inconsistencies in the storyline.The people of Pandora are shown to be stupid. Initially termed as very violent, why do they let humans on their planet in the first place. When Jake goes to them first, everybody wants a piece of him. But when they are getting attacked, no one wants to retaliate. Instead, all they do is gather around defenseless and pray ?? And the way they pray is worse than what humans do.Graphics of the movie might be great, but it lacks on the basic building blocks of a good action / thriller. Watching the character of Jake and the general for 5 minutes, you can easily predict that its going to come down to a duel between them. And thats the main fight ???Once again, I wish to bring to your attention that the storyline and direction sucked.",negative
780,"""Avatar"" became a legendary project even before it was released on big screens around the world. The most famous director James Cameron was preparing to make a new revolution in cinema, giving the world an incredible story about a distant planet and its inhabitants in 3D format. I even remember that in order to prepare cinemas for screening in this still little-known format to the mass audience, the premiere was postponed. But then the film came out and made a real splash, becoming the highest-grossing film in the history of cinema.Cameron's film combines everything necessary for a large-scale and memorable blockbuster: a chic visual range, excellent sound, an interesting and socially significant story. In the experienced hands of the creator, the characters on the screen allow you to get into them, sympathize with someone, and openly hate someone.The movie is long. But it's justified. Cameron introduces viewers to the world of the distant planet Pandora, its inhabitants and nature. Each frame is filled with the brightness of colors and brought, it seems, to perfection. It is this attention to all the details that allows you to really believe what is happening on the screen when viewing.The plot develops slowly enough so that we can get used to our certain laws of this new world for us, feel the life of the aborigines, see how diverse another planet can be with its amazing flora and fauna. But later the action begins to develop much more interesting, bringing the audience to the brewing conflict. Colonizers arrived on an alien planet to extract minerals so necessary on their Land, which cost a lot of money there. But local tribes live just on the deposits of the necessary rare mineral. Hence the conflict situation starts.The story that Cameron is showing is wrapped in a fantastic wrapper, but it perfectly demonstrates events that have already happened and, it seems, are still happening in the real world. People who have the power come to foreign lands and just take what they need. History remembers many such examples. Cameron's work reminds us of the history of mankind and presents it all on the screen in a dramatic form.There are a lot of important characters in the film, who somehow reveal themselves in the film in different situations. We see a great performance from Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and other actors. Thanks to an excellent game and a high-quality scenario, any of the characters looks really alive and real. You believe his motivations, empathize with him or despise him.An important part of the story is the idea of the indivisibility of the nature of the planet and its inhabitants. On Pandora, the locals are part of a common huge organism. Here the world is indivisible. And when aliens from another planet begin to destroy the familiar world order, the viewer already clearly understands, using the example of Pandora, how cruel it is to destroy what was created by this very nature. In my opinion, the director's desire to recall the destructive human activity in our real world is clearly traced here, when few people think about the fact that our planet is undergoing gigantic destruction from human activity. And if we don't stop torturing our Land like this, then the next generations will reap the destructive fruits of their ancestors - us.""Avatar"" is a great story that has conquered the world and the minds of millions of people. A colorful and unforgettable story, another world that became available thanks to the unprecedented imagination of James Cameron. The film contains not only a high-quality picture, but also becomes an important drama that reminds us all that only together we can live on this planet, respecting both each other and the Earth itself.9 out of 10.",positive

784,"First, the graphics of this movie are OUTSTANDING! Pay the extra few bucks and see it in 3D; you won't be disappointed.Second: yes, this is a formulaic plot. Instead of 'dances with wolves' we have 'dances with Na'vii'. Even so, it was well constructed, moved along smoothly enough, and worked well enough that I was OK with that, except....(spoiler here) Third: The ending is completely unrealistic. Assuming 'unobtanium' is as critical and as expensive as stated, and assuming the 'company' has spent as much time, money, and manpower to try to 'negotiate' a solution, either A) they would have NEVER gone in for a direct confrontation as they did, using massive missile assault and unmanned drones instead (are we forgetting Pakistan and Afghanistan?), or B),they would have come back and bombed the na'vii from orbit. I am ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED to both concepts: be VERY clear on this point. But what I am saying is that something this valuable would've never been left as Cameron did at the end of the film. I wish that it were so, but my 30+ years of study of the last 6,000 years of human civilization tells me otherwise....Another thought occurred to me after I wrote this: even with 3 months in cryo, since we clearly have the technology to set up colonies on other worlds WHY WOULD WE STAY ON EARTH IF WE RUINED IT??? Again, not thrilled about this point but if we're going for Willful Suspension of Disbelief Cameron lost me here. I was OK with 10 foot tall blue aliens that look and dress remarkably like the Navaho, I was OK with floating rocks and triceratop-sized creatures that moved like cheetahs, I was even OK with a green earthlike planet that had an atmosphere unbreathable to humans (despite green plants which require chorophyl and a blue sky which requires nitrogen) ---All of that I could live with, until they beat us and we just left. That. Simply. Would not. Happen.",positive
785,"I think i need to review this film again when i can relax and immerse in the experience. The showing i went to was spoiled by two brats who insisted on doing a running commentary during most of the picture which was a huge shame.That aside i really did get the feeling that James Cameron has achieved something major here. His use of technology never seems to get in the way of him making a good film like it does with the Emmerichs and Bays of this world. Cameron has proved that no-one does epic like him. He was almost born to be a popcorn director yet he is so much more at the same time. The story of Avatar is very simple and the plot has obvious comparisons to Dances With Wolves and more recently The Last Samurai. This would probably be more of a drag if the film itself wasn't such a visual knockout, yes, the film is alive, the visuals are truly stunning and the imagination that has gone in to creating this world and these surroundings is remarkable. The cast are all fine, Stephen Lang is fun the cartoonish baddie although it would have been better if we as an audience could have hated him a little more. Sam Worthington continues to grow and is OK as Jake. Sigourney Weaver is always a presence but here she is given a lot less to do than as Ripley in Aliens. In all, i thought Avatar was a resounding success in as much as its visual achievements. The only downside? Every two-bit director in Hollywood will now be making 3D films. A lot of them will be rubbish and few will pass the test in same way Avatar has.",positive
786,"Incredible visuals. Poor story telling coupled with bad characters and nightmarish AWFUL dialogue pull you out of what could have been a GREAT Film. In time this film will fade in its regard, as Titanic did, to a purely visual otherwise so so movie.To say this belongs in the 250 best films is a joke. It will certainly win best picture at the Oscars but in the end its MAYBE the 8th best film out of the 10, maybe.When Cameron doesn't write his films they end up being much much better (Aliens is one of my all time favorites), not that different from George Lucas, both people with an eye for the visual but no talent for writing, especially dialogue.I can't fathom buying this movie on Blu-Ray, it's purely a theater experience, and an interesting one at that, but that's where it ends.Let the lowest common denominator rave about it, you the movie going audience should demand more.",neutral

It was hard to follow along what the story is telling, but I liked the idea of a person's consciousness being transferred into a blue alien body. Overtime, I found myself surprised that it became the world's highest grossing film of all time. It temporarily lost its spot to Avengers: Endgame, until it's 2020 re-release in China. Clearly, James Cameron is a genius in filmmaking, what with the visual effects, the cinematography, the atmosphere of Pandora and the 3D effects. Now that saw Avatar again, I cannot wait for the upcoming long-awaited sequel.",positive

789,"Let me begin with a confession or two: first, I rarely walk out of movies, but I walked out of James Cameron's last must-see movie, ""Titanic,"" well before the iceberg made its appearance. I figured, I already knew the ending, so why endure another hour or so of Rose and Jack, two characters so thoroughly calculated and clich√© that I wanted to throw them both overboard myself.Second, when ""Avatar"" was released, with all the hyperbolic language Hollywood could muster (""movies will never be the same"" was one tag line I remember), I didn't see it in its intended 3D glory. Fact is, I was suspicious of the hype, and felt a little snake-bitten from my last foray into Cameronia. Instead, I waited, and endured in the meantime the jibes of those who saw and loved the movie -- one relative saw the darn thing SEVEN times -- who just could not believe that I had not yet seen it after all this time. Fact is, I really wasn't all that interested. When someone else said that they originally had a similar level of indifference but, after having seen it, ended up loving it, I figured that I would finally invest the nearly three hours. I sat down with my wife last night to watch it. On Bluray, on a beautiful Sony Bravia with a great surround-sound system. But no 3D.Having done so, I can firmly make this statement: without 3D to distract and/or amuse you, this movie is one big steaming pile.Plot: little, and what there is of one is predictable and clich√©. Others have documented the blatant similarities and outright lifting of the plots of other, better movies. Let's just say that if Cameron did in fact write the script in three weeks, he must have spent two of them in a coma.Dialog: burp. From the opening line of someone having had ""a hole blown through his life,"" you know you're in for more cheese than a Wisconsin harvest festival. Junior college creative writing students would have been embarrassed to turn in such work.The vaunted CGI: not to put too fine a point on it, but it was SyFy Channel quality at best. Having on the previous night watched a much more convincing CGI flying beast movie ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" I was absolutely shocked by the poor quality of the CGI. The textures and lighting were lame and unconvincing, and I never for once suspended any sense of disbelief.Acting: who was in this movie again? Between Sam Worthington's Aussie-creep accent in what was supposed to be a flag-flying-red-white-and-blue jar-head character to the Na'vi who fluctuated from speaking halted English to perfect and back again, lets just say that I was left unimpressed and unmoved.Direction: so ""nothing special"" that I can hardly believe the raves this movie got. Fail.And don't even get me started on the ""unobtanium.""I am completely sure that in 3D, this movie was a wonderful visual experience, and enough of one to distract a viewer from the utter lack of originality and substance in the movie itself. Viewing it without this visual aid, however, the movie's flaws are glaring and hard to overlook. Still, Cameron made a bucket-load of money on this movie, so I recognize that mine is a minority opinion. But my wife hated it too, so I got that going for me, which is nice.However, one thing is absolutely and completely certain: I will never again be hoodwinked into turning over my hard-earned cash to the snake-oil salesman who is James Cameron. ""Avatar"" is a movie for thirteen year old male video game enthusiasts or those easily amused by sparkly things. Otherwise, save your dough and your time. You'll be glad you did.",negative
790,"When I saw Terminator 2 in 1994 I did not knew who was the director. But Terminator 2 is still my best action film. I have several of its action scenes clearly in my memory and background music during the action scenes. Like when Arnold Shots and Breaks the chain of the door and then He jumps from the high point on the below road with bike. And the sparks coming out of tires of the HD bike. The hospital scene where Arnold takes out gun from the Rose bouquet and steps over the roses. Similarly there were few more remarkable scenes. Then came Titanic and as we all know it was such a grand movie. Depicting the grandness of the Ship and touching love story all very beautifully. I felt a lot of same kind of unforgettable effects while watching Avatar. The background music in the end giving a similar kind of beat as it was in Terminator 2: The Judgment Day. The film making is not just about utilizing the latest technology and to increase the budget. Its neither about to show all of your imaginations on the Silver Screen. (Harry Potter series have also a lot of imaginations but I never admired them). Actually the film making is about how you can capture the audience whole interest as they feel themselves involved in the situation. And when finally the audience comes out of the Cinema Hall he/she can easily re-construct the whole ideas of the film and can join it all together, to generate more interest in the mind to see it even multiple times. I just want to say Long Live James Cameron. If I can have some of his brilliance in me I will think myself very much blessed and lucky.",positive

A lot of people says, that because of the movie took 12 years from the writing to the finish, it could not live up to its expectations. I simply hate the word expectation. Would it have been any better if it only took 5 years to make? lets say you had not heard of the movie, and you went to the cinema to watch it. Tell me, would it have been any better then? And by the way the 12 years was not just 12 years of film making. it included expanding the technology of 3d and other. If Avatar is gonna be followed as predicted, it will take much less years, because the graphics and the characters is already perfected.I have also heard that some people thinks that the plot and dialog was too unoriginal. If it is not original, there is a reason why it has been used in other movies (and works), and why take the chance after 14 years of hard work, if people don't find the originality any good. (By the way, I think that there are a lot of originality to offer in this movie.) The movie did not leave you with any tricky thoughts or exciting mystery which has been solved. That kind of movie, can i only watch the first time being excited about it. I could kill to watch avatar again(not literally), because of the super effects and the many emotions all around the film. at last I want to say that the 3d was brilliant, and the actors performed flawless. Good job James.9/10. And i am not even a Sci-Fi fan. But James Cameron also likes to call it an Action-Adventure-Fantasy ;)",positive
792,"This is movie making at its finest. A beautiful heartfelt message, loveable characters from a range of backgrounds and beliefs, wonderful newly developed technical aspects of movie making that never overplay the message. This is Hollywood at its finest. This is The Wizard of Oz for our generation...the message, the writing the acting the technical aspects all work to create a deeply moving film. Altough it is wonderful on the small screen it is amazing on the big screen. We paid to see it at a movie theatre. When then went again to see it with friends, we bought it so we can watch it at home and when it is rereleased later this year we will go to see it on the big screen again. Roll over Sound of Music, tell Casablanca the news!!!",positive
793,"Avatar is the bestest movie in a long long time. It's a sight to be seen. If you thought Lord of the Rings had cool effects than you don't know anything. Avatar has taken visual effects and brought them to a new high. I don't think any movie can ever beat Avatar's special effects for a long long time. It's pretty early sure but I think Avatar will be judged as one of the greatest movies of all time. It has a classic storyline of good and evil, right and wrong, but it is only with blue aliens instead. Cameron has created his own brilliant world and populated it with aliens with a unique mythology. We want to know how to be like them but only action hero Sam Worthington can discover the secrets. The idea of the Avatar is one of the most original sci-fi creations. It takes a certain inspired brilliance to have Jake Sully a wheel chaired guy to become a creature of the forest through virtual reality. The 3-D in Avatar is by far the best I've ever seen. If you want great 3-D than Avatar is the way to go. James Cameron is the King of the World and if I were him I'd simply retire because he has made a great movie, too great really. All other Sci-Fi epics pale in comparison to Avatar. Stephen Lang's character is a better villain than Darth Vader...",positive
794,"I only give this movie a 7, cause of the visual effects. The visual effects of this movie are probably the best ever, and very huge in its genre. But if you take a look to the story, I think you better can go watching a simple love story between the bad and the good. Cameron is great as director and he knows very well what he wants with his movie, the cinematography in this movie is also very good. The acting is not bad, but in this movie there isn't really an acting ensemble. The Art-Direction is also very very good. So I want to say: Huge performance by the visual effects team, and Cameron delivers good work, But: As is said, the story is too simple. It's just a simple love story with a bit sci-fi.",positive
795,"I came to this film purely by chance. I had seen Sherlock Holmes and was heading to my car when my brother called. I met him at the exit to the cinema. I had an apparently ""speical"" offer. One of my brother's friends had gotten sick, so would I like to see Avatar? In IMAX 3D no less? I had seen T2 when I was younger, but the name of the director did not register to me. I had seen half of Alien before I ran screaming out of the room. I had never seen a trailer for this, and the only warning I got was a poster. The one with the Na'vi face. Not much of a heads-up! I went in not knowing anything. No plot, no expectations... And this move removed any limits I have put on a film. It was real. The planet, the Na'vi, and the humans. I came here and read the reviews before I went back and watched it. I have now seen it 3 times. For the apparent disappointment you seem to feel, I can not fathom. I am no movie critic. I am no Si-fi fan. But I think that if a language for a movie is made by a PHD, it might hold some water. If it is just like ""Dance with the Wolves"" (I have never seen) then...well, Where are wolves exactly? I certainly didn't see Ankin jump out at any point. Or the T-1000. And this wasn't an awful gushy romance like Titanic (the film was awesome, the actor's, no so much) . This move can hold it's own. The second one...well, I will be waiting.",positive
796,"Seven days after the movie was released in cinemas here in Australia I went to see this movie, in 3D of course. Not because i was lazy and waited all that time but because I couldn't get a ticket. Everyday since release it was sold out until my friend had a spare ticket. What amazed me was the detailed graphics which were visually stunning, but other than that the movie lacked. The plot line was weak and predictable. Every great movie has a unique story that is different in contrast to any other. All I believe this movie needed was is a better story line, maybe drag the war longer.But I do recommend everyone, people of all ages and cultures to go to the cinemas while its still playing (which I know it still will for a long time seeing as how people are still talking about it). I'm sure every person will understand the language of art that the movie communicates. The sex scene with the avatars (although we didn't get to see them actually do it) was extremely creepy. The Banshee's were awesome though.",positive
797,"Let me start the review with an inspiring note. Avatar portrays one thing - 'If you have passion for something you are going to end up on winning side'. Whether its the 'camera-man' Cameron's effort to pull up a movie as brilliant like this or the Na'vis, your passion and dedication can turn around things. I went to the movie with a big big hype around it. It was supposed to be the biggest budget movie of all time with some unbelievable graphic effects. Pleasingly enough, the movie meets all that perfectly. You are taken to a alien world actually. Most of the shots feel to be out of world. The movie plays on like a frame of art. Each frame is detailed to perfection. So much that you keep on admiring the beauty. Pandora ( the alien planet) seems to be an inviting place. I would have paid anything to go to a trip to this place, if possible. That's the magic of Cameron's imagination and how he brought it live in front you. Credits to his whole team for pulling it up.I won't waste anytime in briefing the story line. It has been done many times here and in media. And definitely no spoilers. Even if you know the whole story of movie still go for it. The storyline is simple and at sometimes similar to Bollywood movies( I am from India) but still it doesn't bore you anytime. You will always want to see the movie. Its an experience in itself.Am going for the movie again. So should you. Highly recommended.",positive
798,"I finally saw Avatar in 3D and I have to say technically it is very good - you wouldn't expect nothing less from James Cameron. The 3D effects are very nice to watch, but as you already have guessed here comes the criticism.I personally think that once you are adopted to the 3D image and if you put that aside, there is nothing much left than a poor remake of ""dances with Wolves"". The story could be told in a much shorter time. The ""acting"" of the Na'vi is almost none existent.The characters are very two dimensional, only Sully appears to be a 3D character. The design of the fighting robot in the end reminds me of the robot from aliens, only the fight back then was better, more suspense.So, if you love the 3d stuff, go and watch it again, otherwise wait for a better 3d flick or spend your money on a Dances with wolves DVD/blu-ray.",neutral
799,"Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine who travels to the world of Pandora to do what he thinks is protecting the Earth. The natives of that world are said to be vicious and cruel. By transforming into one of them in his sleep (or something) he realizes they are NOT the evil ones and he begins to have serious doubts about his mission. This leads to an all out battle at the end.Basically this is cowboys vs. Indians in outer space. This is VERY easy to follow and understand which is the main problem. Everything here is totally and utterly predictable! You've seen these characters and situations all before. I was always one or two steps ahead on the plot and this isn't good for a movie that runs a needless 165 minutes. This could have easily been wrapped up in 90 minutes. Some people find getting into the world of the aliens is fascinating. I wasn't fascinated at all--just thoroughly and utterly bored! To make matters worse the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book and the characters are either evil or good--no shades of grey or ambiguity. The movie also preaches it's against war but ""entertains"" us with an all out battle at the end. Lots of people agree that the plot is light but the incredible special effects make up for it. Not for me! Yeah the special effects are impressive (especially in 3-D) but that isn't enough for such a long movie with a dull storyline. I can't really comment on the acting here considering no one is given a character to play--they're all walking, talking clich√©s. Only two people stand out--Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver. Worthington is very handsome with beautiful eyes and a cute little Australian accent. Weaver is strong and commanding playing a scientist.I will admit the battle at the end was (kind of) fun but I was mostly bored silly throughout this. I kept looking at my watch patiently waiting for this to end. I have to admit I'm in the minority here. It's gotten rave reviews from critics and has already broken box office records. I attended a 4:30 show on a Saturday afternoon--and it was sold out! It's also among the top 50 movies here on IMDb. I guess a lot of people like predictable stories with non-stop special effects and cardboard characters. I need something more than that. The 2 is only for the effects and hot Worthington.",negative
800,"Well, here it is.James Cameron's project has been hyped to within an inch of its proverbial life over the years, what with the epic budget, alleged re-inventing of special effects and some admittedly underwhelming trailers full of conspicuously computer-generated blue elves. The question that's burning in everybody's mind leading up to its release this week is: Is it really that great? The answer: pretty much, yeah. But more on that in a bit.For those of you who haven't heard the story, the plot revolves around paraplegic marine Sully (Sam Worthington), who's offered a second chance at life on the lush alien planet of Pandora. The humans on the planet are engaged in a war with the native population, blue humanoid warriors known as the Na'vi, over extremely valuable natural resources. To this end, a handful of scientists (led by a delightfully taciturn Sigourney Weaver) have created an ""avatar"" project where people control cloned Na'vi in order to get close to the tribes and work something out. Through a cruel twist of fate, Sully ends up controlling one such avatar and from there the story well and truly begins.Now, where do I start with Avatar? The film's a lot of things, but it's obviously not perfect, and I'm not sure whether to address its flaws or good points first. Something tells me I'll go with the flaws first. It's hard to judge them too objectively - it all depends on just how tolerant you can be. I'd probably say the film's worst flaw also plays a huge part in defining just how good (or bad) the film is. I refer of course to the film's copious use of CGI characters. This is a problem that I think will depend on the viewer. Either you're going to find it horribly distracting the whole way through or get used to it after about five minutes. I reckon this is something that is up to every viewer to decide. Myself - I fall into the latter camp. Just as well, because that could very well be the major deciding point in how to judge the film, if only because Avatar is saturated with CGI. Not like that's a bad thing, as a lot of the CGI looks very flash. Avatar's look is pretty damned impressive, all things considered. Between the lush locations, slick gadgetry and veritable cornucopia of action available, I can hardly see how the film's abundance of CGI is a problem. It definitely aims high and hits its mark a lot.With that main issue out of the way, the rest of the film manages to be considerably strong a lot of the time. Once the story gets going, it stays riveting for much of its lengthy runtime. It's well-written, even if one of the central metaphors seems a little too obvious (powerful corporation attacking harmless natives over valuable resources - not exactly subtle) and it managed to keep reasonably surprising all the way to the end. The acting was by and large good; Worthington doesn't exactly shine as the hero, but he performs reasonably well. The highlight is probably Weaver, although there's something to be said for Stephen Lang's battle-scarred colonel, who makes up for a general lack of character dimension with relative ease.The real question remains as to just how great Avatar is. It's definitely an amazing epic in spite of its few flaws and relative lack of originality, so it's admittedly far from perfect. It remains by and large a visual extravaganza if nothing else, and should deserve consideration for one of the better blockbusters of the year (if not necessarily one of the best films). Depending on your expectations, it either wasn't quite as great as it could have been or it was far superior. If you had mixed expectations like I did, it's probably a mix of both. Avatar remains a technically great piece, a bit lightweight in parts, but overall pretty damned good. I'll definitely be checking this out in 3-D, anyway.",positive

803,"First, let me start by saying how James Cameron has made amazing blockbuster hits that just wowed the world. Aliens = godlike. Terminator = amazing. T2 = beastly. Then, after his somehow famous Titanic made so much money, he didn't make another movie, or at least, not another blockbuster. That was 1997. Now, Avatar came out in 2009, more then a decade after titanic, ample time to use that genius brain of his to create another masterpiece. He made new technology, his little cool visual effects camera, which wowed the world too. But sadly, the movie itself, honestly, has been way too over-hyped and I don't know what everyone is watching, but really is nothing spectacular. Avatar first is a beautiful movie. The visuals are amazingly immersing, the world is just lush. But looks is nothing if it doesn't have substance. The story was awfully terrible. It was so clichéd that I'm surprised James Cameron wanted to do this movie. Seriously, after more than 10 years of not making a movie, it's like Cameron never saw another movie made during that time and thought Avatar's script was original. It's awful. And I do not understand how people believe that this is a great movie, the best you've ever seen, true turning point in movie making. Yea sure the visuals may be good, but definitely not a monumental turning point. Also, as said before, the visuals are beautiful and immersing, but quite frankly, it's nothing new. Cameron wanted to make this movie soon after Titanic but it would've cost 200 million more than it had cost to make Avatar 09. But if he had made Avatar back then, then THEN you can say ""now that was a turning point movie"". But come on Cameron! this is the 21st century! So many good looking movies already have came out, yours is not any different. And to make things worse, you have one of the most clichéd plot in the entire world. I bet you anything 10 other movies that have been a blockbusters have the exact same plot. Even some Cinemax movies have this type of plot. Also the acting. Yea, that was pretty bad. When I first saw Sam Worthington in a movie, i though, wow, what a bad***, he looks so cool. But after Avatar, and even Clash of the Titans, it's either he can't act, or he's just choosing terrible movies to be a part of. Another aspect of Avatar was that it was too long. Way too long. Long movies are good when you have an immersing storyline or great action sequences. And Avatar had none of those. The action was so bad. Just god awful bad. The end fight scene (a HUGE cliché) was just so bad. Yea, cool mech suits. ooooo. But wow, it was so boring. and so stupid. OVerall, Avatar make look good, but story was terribly clichéd, acting was just pointless, and the visuals, i mean, its 2009, it's not like something we've never imagined before. Therefore I rate this movie a 6, only because the visuals are above par, but even that can't handle the terrible story and boring acting. And for all those people who are hating on my review, saying ""this is a masterpiece"", i feel sorry for you.",neutral
804,"The film's plot centers around a paraplegic Marine (Worthington) who is dispatched to Pandora on a unique mission, but becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home.

805,"Apparently Jim Cameron forgot the first rule of movie making ""Tell a good story"". The recipe for this film, can best be described as: Take some ""native American spiritualism/mysticism"", add an ounce of effects from Aliens, a dash of Terminator 2, and more than a pinch of the crap love story from Titanic, add a ton of hype, and stir in a gullible audience, mix well, and cook for an interminable 2 hours and 42 minutes. This is apparently how to make the highest grossing film of all time, Cameron needs to be reminded though that highest grossing does not equal BEST. I give this flick a 5 out of ten due to the run time which could easily have told the same story in about 2 hours flat. As has become usual for a Cameron film the music was annoying, and too frigging loud. I could go on but will not bother.",positive
806,"""Avatar"" is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message. It is predestined to launch a cult. It contains such visual detailing that it would reward repeating viewings. It invents a new language, Na'vi, as ""Lord of the Rings"" did, although mercifully I doubt this one can be spoken by humans, even teenage humans. It creates new movie stars. It is an Event, one of those films you feel you must see to keep up with the conversation. The story, set in the year 2154, involves a mission by U. S. Armed Forces to an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star. This new world, Pandora, is a rich source of a mineral Earth desperately needs. Pandora represents not even a remote threat to Earth, but we nevertheless send in ex-military mercenaries to attack and conquer them. Gung-ho warriors employ machine guns and pilot armored hover ships on bombing runs. You are free to find this an allegory about contemporary politics. Cameron obviously does. At 163 minutes, the film doesn't feel too long. It contains so much. The human stories. The Na'vi stories, for the Na'vi are also developed as individuals. The complexity of the planet, which harbors a global secret. The ultimate warfare, with Jake joining the resistance against his former comrades. Small graceful details like a floating creature that looks like a cross between a blowing dandelion seed and a drifting jellyfish, and embodies goodness. Or astonishing floating cloud-islands. Cameron promised he'd unveil the next generation of 3-D in ""Avatar."" I'm a notorious skeptic about this process, a needless distraction from the perfect realism of movies in 2-D. Cameron's iteration is the best I've seen and more importantly, one of the most carefully-employed. The film never uses 3-D simply because it has it, and doesn't promiscuously violate the fourth wall. He also seems quite aware of 3-D's weakness for dimming the picture, and even with a film set largely in interiors and a rain forest, there's sufficient light.",positive
807,"Pandora is a wondrous place that expands the imagination. I really enjoyed the idea that the Navi would make physical contact with the Banshee and sort of ""mind meld"" for flight together. The sparkle that emitted from the trees as they ran was like phosphorescence in the ocean. In fact a lot of Pandora reminded me of life under water (we SCUBA in our family). Sadly that's where the positive ends for me.I thought the story lacked character development; the audience has to fill in a lot of story line and history, and the worst part was how evil were painted the humans. They were written as barbarians without concern for the Navi which I just don't find believable. Seems like a political statement was behind the writing.Lastly I found the 3D distracting. I think the 3D push is coming from the studios rather than from the audience. Certainly there will be a segment of the population that is enamored by 3D but overall I'm quite happy with 2D. For me the story line is much more important than the image. I can still enjoy old black & white movies if the story is believable and the direction is done well. I went to the 3D showing and paid $3 extra out of curiosity but won't do that again. If this is the best the industry has to offer, and I found it distracting, then there is no reason to be curious again.One thought lingers about the movie. I didn't feel there was anywhere for this to go in the future. Star Trek and Star Wars always left me wanting more. I would like more of Pandora and the Navi but the plot just didn't lend itself to a follow up. So I am left feeling detached from it rather than a part of a movement.",neutral
808,"I have no idea how this movie continues to get listed among the greatest, and why it soared so high when it did. Every word spoken is forced, unoriginal, one-liner quality annoyance that should be left for high school plays.The story is no different than Pocahontas on a different planet. The most predictable movie I have ever seen. Borderline plagiaristic.",negative
809,"Avatar's success was thoroughly unprecedented. No one expected the blue alien movie to be the highest-grossing movie of all time. Though it was marketed as an event film, I remember very little fanfare leading up to it.And then the movie came out. People watched it, reactions were mixed, typically around the center of the critical spectrum. Few loved it, few hated it. Most thought it was just okay. General criticisms were that the movie was just Dances in Wolves in space, it was too long, and overly simplistic. Though it went on to massive, unreasonable financial success, it faded fast from people's memories. In a few years, people remembered it not for its narrative, not for its characters, but for how much money it made. Then again, that really might have been the most interesting thing about it.Before watching the sequel, I decided to refresh my memory. I settled in, braced myself, and started up the film's extended edition.And I have to say: it was pretty darn good.When you know exactly where the story is going and have a general idea of when it's going to get there, it's far easier to tolerate what on earlier viewings you might have considered to be wheel-spinning. Cameron spends so much time not advancing the plot, delivering pretty visuals and character moments with middling, redundant character insights, but they're delivered in such a brilliantly crafted box that it hardly matters. Cameron really is a master craftsman, and it's a joy to take in his vision, particularly in an era of blockbuster cinema when vision is no longer a priority.The film does make some mistakes I can't overlook though, particularly in its treatment of its female lead, Neytiri. Saldana puts in an expressive, passionate performance, but is reduced to a standard tsundere trope. She brings Jake into the tribe, teaches him their ways, and falls in love with him in the process, but she is disappointingly single-minded and flat. Her humanity has no texture; she's more symbol than character.However, the main character is solid. I know this is an unpopular opinion. Worthington definitely struggles with the accent and occasionally abandons it entirely. But he plays the character well. Jake Sully is a good guy, easy to root for. His mistakes we chalk up to general jarhead dumbness, not ill-intent. He's bold, but not obnoxious, confrontational, but not cruel, and most importantly, he approaches the Navi and their culture with an open heart and open mind. Any judgment he may feel towards them is washed away once he immerses himself in their way of life.The movie is long, and the plot is familiar. But these aren't necessarily bad things. Familiar stories are comforting. They're cozy. And Avatar's first two acts are just that. Watching them, I felt the wonder I didn't feel when I watched the film as a child. Understanding just how much Cameron cares about the environment, how much he wants to preserve and protect it is vital to the experience. Avatar remains a film where its creator's love for filmmaking and nature shines through, and that's something I can easily appreciate.",positive

The 3D was absolutely groundbreaking and has never been equalled,(...there have been some pathetic attempts but I'm afraid the Bar was set far,far too high by maestro Cameron...). It's well documented that the story was probably the weakest aspect of this film,and while I agree I don't think that was the point...the visuals were AMAZING,next level stuff and were never ever boring and the action was INCREDIBLE!!...Despite the weak narrative Mr Cameron is,to my mind,THE Greatest director of Sci-Fi action films ever.",positive
811,"I'm writing this review after watching this film the night before seeing it's extremely belated sequel at the cinema.Honestly, I think this film still looks utterly amazing even if was released today. The scale, the scope, the attention to detail is still simply beyond anything that was ever released before or since.James Cameron is responsible for a chunk of my absolute favourite movies. The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, T2, True Lies, Titanic - they are all masterpieces of action/sci fi blockbuster cinema with every release representing a massive leap in the technical side of the craft in one way or another, and it feels like this film is a cumulation of these amazing movies. You can see the 'lived in' military feel of aliens and the first terminator here - he has realised the APC and mech suit from his 1986 masterpiece in their fullest glory, the CGI and lighting from T2, the gorgeous luminosity from the ET's in the Abyss, the thudding action of true lies, the epic sweep of Titanic - it all manifests here and then some.The visuals here though at the end of 2022 are frankly astounding still, from the cold military feel on the human side to the lush, gorgeous, colourful world of Pandora this film is a visual treat from start to finish. The human's technology looks utterly realistic and plausible, with every ship, screen and weapon looking like it actually exists instead of it being fantasy tech. Each animal and plant, wether it's something attacking our heroes or a background creature looks like it's had the utmost of thought paid to it's design, colour and sound. Put simply, it creates a world that you have never seen in your wildest dreams and it all works in harmony with everything in this beautiful movie. 13 years on and to me, it still looks pretty much perfect and still above every other blockbuster ever made.And boy does James Cameron know how to direct an action scene. He was already the master pretty much but here you can see it in all it's glory. Every action scene is crisp, clear, coherent yet visceral. Just witness for example the brief scene where the dog type beast near the beginning of the film gets hold of Jakes rucksack - the camera pans around the scene, in slow mo for a few seconds whilst jake wriggles free and attempts to escape, it's a simple yet effective scene that sums up the directors skill in this field, which basically reads 'unmatched' - it's just a small yet subtle reminder of this amazing director's skillset in crafting intimate action scenes or massive set pieces, of which there are many in this.The biggest criticism that most people level at this tends to be the derivative plot, and if I'm honest, it's still a valid criticism.The thing is though, I simply don't care.This film is so utterly immersive, in ways that nothing has ever been before, it just makes up for any storytelling shortcomings. The world building here is off the scale amazing, you really feel like Pandora is a living, breathing place - it's not unlike one of the recent Rockstar games in that you lose yourself in this amazing environment and it seems almost odd when you have to extract yourself from it at the end and rejoin the real world.Big screen entertainment doesn't really get a higher endorsement than that does it?Yes the story is something you will have seen before, but it is well executed, does exactly what it needs to do and no more. It still manages to hit some excellent emotional beats and to be honest, if it were a complicated plot it would detract from what this movie says and does. It has a strong environmental and anti war message which is central to the narrative here and works just like the themes of motherhood in aliens and fatherhood in T2 etc. It's what I come to expect from James Cameron - simple and effective storytelling.For me, this is just an absolute lesson in blockbuster filmmaking and is a must see. I saw this in 3D IMAX in 2009 and it was pretty much the best cinema experience I think I've ever had, but even watching this at home on blu ray it still looks cutting edge 13 years later.An easy 10 out of 10. Never underestimate James Cameron.",positive
812,"This, and maybe like a handful of other movies in my nearly three decades of existence, drew and pulled me away the wat the first Avatar movie did. And it's not just the CGI or SFX! The plot might be pretty straightforward, but it's given depth with the amazing cast, voice acting, timing/pacing (which, as a college editor lol, I can tell you is an extremely underrated skill and element in all movies), and the score.The native tongue and various elements of the tribe seem so real in the moment, you forget it's all made up and just a take on actual Indigenous culture and struggles. It's those moments of realism, based on just the sheer ugliness of humanity and its hunger for power, that feels so seamlessly parallel to real world colonization and history.If you think this movie is just a bunch of over-powered, basketball-player-sized Smurfs running around a green screen, you are horribly mistaken, my dude. You need to give this movie a try, especially if you're into Sci-Fi.",positive
813,"When I first saw this film at relative's house back in 2009, I could only sum it up as ""Wow. That was incredible"". I've probably watched it 3 times now over the past few years, my views have changed. Let me try to show think: On the visual side, it's like man going to the moon. The CGI is breathtaking, realistic and I can't even begin to imagine what it's like on 3D display. It is a milestone for CGI. On the storside it's like a pack of mints. A nice taste at first, but after while you get bored of it. To be perfectly honest, the storyline is VERY basic-man meets people, man wants to be like people, man 'betrays' his own kind, massive battle, the end. The problem I have is that there is just nothing to it. A film like Inception has hundreds of other sidestories within it. I really couldn't find that many, or any that were good, in Avatar. It's just a too basic for my liking. Also, I didn'y feel any emotion. When I saw War Horse, I was on the edge of my seat, sweating. It was exhilarating and emotional. Avatar just didn't have that. Sure, the last attack scene is pretty awesome, but I just didn't feel any exhilaration or emotion. This is where it falls down. And I think that it's a really big shame that it does this, because if it cleared up these parts, it would be amazing. In conclusion, it's great at first, and you will gawk at the CGI, but there is very little else to it, and this is what lets it down.",neutral
814,"After over a decade since the film 'Titanic' became the highest grossing film of all time and placed itself in-between Ben-Hur & Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King for the most academy awards ever won by a single film, James Cameron returns to bring the audience 'AVATAR' a film rumoured to be more expensive than any other film (if so it would be the third time Cameron has broken the record) and is claimed to be a revolution in 3-D technology and visual effects. And after all the hype and media attention Cameron has given us a brilliant film, well told and brilliantly crafted. Cameron's direction is perfect and confident, after allowing the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich to try and direct large action films he returns to show them how a master does it. The acting is superb and supported by the incredible visual effects, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver's performances all shine through the blue creatures known as the Na'vi. The visual effects are incredible and if Avatar - likely to see a best picture nomination as well - does not sweep the technical categories it will be a joke on the Oscars, worse than the Golden Compass winning visual effects over Transformers. James Horner's third collaboration with Cameron as a composer is once again a triumph and while I still prefer the Titanic soundtrack, his music is a perfect blend of Aliens, Titanic and original music that you have never heard before. The pacing is wonderful and nothing short of an epic and if I had a problem it was only with the dialogue. I would prefer if James Cameron wrote the screen story but co-wrote the screenplay with someone else. The film is certainly a milestone and should definitely be seen.",positive
815,"Back in 2009 during this films theatrical run I saw this over four times in IMAX 3D the cinematography and the cgi was revolutionary. This film truly is a cinematic marvel and a must watch on the big screen.Where as this film boosts amazing technology, it's story is nothing groundbreaking. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and Joel David Moore all give great performances alongside the rest of the supporting cast. But this story just feels so preachy and politically motivated it annoys me everytime I sitdown to watch this film.The sneak peek at the end of the film for Way of Water was absolutely beautiful seems like it's shaping up to be a must see in IMAX 3D as was and is Avatar. Whatever issues I may with Cameron and the story he chose to tell in this film he undoubtedly created a beautiful world that sparks genuine intrigue and wonder.I look forward to Way of Water and undoubtedly whatever amazing cgi and wonderful cinematography awaits in the long awaited sequel.IMDb: 7/10

816,"I went to the opening night at the cinema to watch this and it was packed. Going in with the expectation that it may be all hype and i would be disappointed but, I wasn't The 3D experience was great, there was a good character base, a theme of action, adventure, love and sci fi all rolled into one.The whole movie was flawless and it didn't feel like it dragged on or you couldn't wait for the ending, instead you liked the characters, you loved the Navai and you enjoyed the scope of the movie.I give the movie a 10 because it was colourful, it was different, it had plot and i enjoyed it.Well worth the wait.",positive
817,"With ""Avatar"" James Cameron practically bludgeons us with his own brand of ""green"" political correctness. Let's see ... An advanced race of people invade a serene wilderness in order to subjugate the peaceful natives. No, that doesn't sound anything like the leftist drivel passing for American history today, does it? Politics aside, the movie is breathtaking in its scope, with special effects that are nothing short of miraculous. Viewers are certainly drawn into the world of Pandora. Watching the movie, with its green-screen wonderment, provides a welcome escape from our everyday lives. Unfortunately, this movie fails us in other ways. While I certainly don't share the tree-hugging politics of Cameron and his ilk, I could have appreciated the movie more if he would have at least inserted some nuance into the characters. Instead, we have the stereotypical colonel trampling the forest and mowing down the peaceful aliens while spouting B-movie lines. Oh well, guess you can't have everything, even for $250 million.",neutral
818,"The story is one of the most unoriginal i've ever seen. The CGI is as good as they say but who cares? The best CGI in the world can't save a movie this bad. The acting is sub-par. I didn't find a single character to be one I could be sympathetic with. There are basically two sides, the tree hugging hippie natives and the Hitler-esquire humans who just wanna kill anyone who doesn't agree with them. The action is almost all at the end and even then its not very good. As you have probably heard the story is basically the same as Pocahontas. This is 100% true. As I touched on earlier the acting is not good. I wanted to strangle pretty much every single character throughout the entire movie. It's almost like they were trying to be unlikeable.",negative
819,"My Take: A jaw-dropping and visually-thrilling experience. An event movie that lives up to the hype.Watching and judging a movie primarily on its special effects would seem like a shallow way to look at movie-making, but for movies like James Cameron's latest AVATAR (A pet-project of his since he became ""king-of-the-world"" in TITANIC), you can't help but get carried away by the brilliant visual magic in place. But I mean that in the best way, because you don't only see AVATAR as an event movie, you experience it as an event itself. Since I saw the movie in Digital 3-D, I don't know how AVATAR would fare in 2-D. But I'll have you this: 3-D is the best possible way to see this movie, if not THE only way to see it. The last time I saw a movie on 3-D was the awful G-FORCE, which had me exhausted with wearing those glasses in the first 15 minutes (let alone, 88 minutes). Well, I wore those glasses for almost three hours in AVATAR, and I never got tired. Here's a movie where 3-D doesn't only enhance the already impressive effects, it also enhances the story into a full-blown experience.I've heard a lot of people (critics mostly) complaining that the plot was mundane, but Cameron was the first to admit that this would be an old-fashioned adventure story. Along with the many old-fashioned stories, there are also several allusions to Cameron's ALIENS, 2007's BATTLE FOR TERRA, KING KONG, DANCES WITH WOLVES, and even POCAHONTAS as well as some of the ""save the rain forest"" elements of FERNGULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST. At first, Sam Worthington had me a little nervous as the hero, but he turned out to be just fine as Jake Sully, a paraplegic wheelchair-bound Marine who must continue his brother's task to study the inhabitants of a beautiful yet dangerous moon called Pandora called the Na'Vi, by infiltrating their environments by means of replicates called Avatars. Their mission is to study these humanoid natives so that the company he serves will know how to extract Unobtainium, a precious rock-like material, hidden somewhere in the moon. But this is just the movie's McGuffin as the story focuses more on Jake's love for the beautiful forests of Pandora, his appreciation for its culture, his romance with a Na'Vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually the battle to save the planet from the greed of humanity.Cameron has been known to push the envelope in his movies, but after TITANIC (still a placeholder for #1 highest-grossing movie of all time), how could he possibly top anything that he had done before? Well AVATAR not only lives up to the hype before it, it may have even surpassed it. AVATAR has been dubbed a ""game-changer"", and visually, it might be. The technology used in AVATAR is not only impressive, it might just change the way we see movies in the future (if ever this would be topped). Motion-capture has been done several times before, but (maybe with a few exceptions) no other film has done it so perfectly. The CGI avatars (so to speak) are not some dead-eyed CGI critter, you care for them as if they were more human than the actual flesh-and-blood characters on-screen. Cameron not only waited for the right technology to make AVATAR (this was supposed to be done back in 1999 after TITANIC, but the technology wouldn't allow it), he made sure it was perfect. Call him a perfectionist, but don't say he doesn't succeed. But you'd think, with all the visual hokus-pokus he had in his hands, Cameron might just be another George Lucas. But his years in hiatus has not stopped him from being a professional storyteller. Old-fashioned or not, he tells the story in the most spectacular way possible. From the opening scenes to the spectacular, eye-popping finale, AVATAR never lets up for 3 hours (actually, 162 minutes). It's gonna be hard to top this one, maybe even for Cameron himself! Rating: ***** out of 5.",positive
820,"I like this movie, good story, nice animations, good actors, spectacular 3d effects!!",positive
821,"SEE IT - AVATAR lives up to the expectations for visual innovation that were promised. This is truly a spellbinding experience, with a storyline and character development that are were just right to support the stunning visual panoramas that the mind will struggle to absorb. Director Cameron has beautifully woven social, spiritual, environmental, technological, and personal threads into the action scenes that are presented using tiny delicate creatures and majestic landscapes to grab the audience throughout the entire movie.It is one of those experiences that should be enjoyed for a second time, I know I will",positive
822,"Avatar is, as you will have seen from other reviews, probably the most visually stunning movie ever made. The scenes of the beauty of Pandora will knock you out! Watching the movie it was very easy to forget (and I did) that the characters were CGI creatures, so real were they implemented. The beauty of the film is contrasted with the gung ho American marines and the greed of the mining company trying to exploit the natural resources of Pandora, without in any way understanding its beauty or the close bond felt by the Pandorans to their environment and the other life on the planet.The plot of the film is excellent and the soundtrack superb, frequently making you jump with unexpected highly realistic sounds.The best film I have seen in a very long time, way up there with the Lord of the Rings, my previous favourite film (and story) of all time.I felt that the Director was trying to say something about man in this film, on the one hand able to be noble and capable of creating stunning beauty (just see the visuals in this film) and the contrasting violence, greed and stupidity that we can show. God knows what will happen if and when we do meet aliens, they will probably be shot to pieces before we can ever learn anything about them! In summary, don't hesitate to see this film, I defy you not to be enthralled in the stunning beauty of Pandora and the superb story.",positive
823,"Avatar is the most sublime piece of CG film making I have ever witnessed. All the doubts I had going into the film about how the visuals were geared to revolutionize movies were quickly quelled when witnessing the lush forests and amazing diversity of organisms within Pandora. The tidbits of the trailer do not do justice to the big screen and once you pay for your 8$ ticket and witness it for yourself, you will see exactly what I mean. That being said, I cannot help but to criticize the familiar story and exhausted plot elements. Every twist and turn in Avatar is expected through the familiar formula we have all seen through Dances With Wolves and The Last Samurai. I could not help but to think of the South Park episode ""Dances with Smurfs"" every time the movie took a conventional turn (For everyone who has seen that episode you know exactly what I mean). Yet regardless of the orthodox storyline I still found myself drawn in to the world of the Navi and their plight against the humans. The characterization is strong enough to make you care for them and the pulse-pounding action doesn't hurt either. I would also like to commend the several allegorical undertones that this film incites. Avatar is a critique of the evils of imperialism as well as several political themes that run profoundly through contemporary times, such as the war in Iraq. Granted it is not the first film to do this, it never hurts to remind movie-goers of the malicious purposes of many of those who hold power. Crap I am almost out of room. This movie is fun just do not expect Shakespeare. 7/10",positive
824,"oh my god, i have seen a lot of movies, although there are still a few movies i like more than avatar, but i give avatar a perfect 10/10, and i've never given any movie a perfect score. Avatar deserve a special spot on its own, in that it is not just a movie, it's an experience, watch it in 3d and imax if you can, because you almost feel like you are there. YOU HAVE TO GO SEE IT. PERIOD. It made me depressed afterwards that i have to go back to the normal, boring life again. oh, how much i would give to live in pandora! I also like the romance in the movie, that got me kind of emotional.ps: don't wait for the DVD, don't watch it on the computer or TV, don't see it in 2d, or even 3d, but see it in IMAX 3D, and i promise you will not regret it.",positive
825,"I saw this film at the cinema in 3D when it first came out and while it is more impressive on a technical level rather than as a piece of storytelling, Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking. Avatar is joyously entertaining and energetic and is also a smart combination of the Matrix and Star Wars, with a result that's stylish. Sam Worthington's character is compelling because you can easily care for and sympathize with him through his journey on Pandora. The movie has a surprising soul and is surprisingly sweet too. The pacing is great, the special effects are great, the score is hauntingly powerful and the filmmaking formula in Avatar is smoothly efficient and original. The film successfully manages to absorb you into its own universe. I thought that James Cameron's vision of the future matched the imagination he put into the attractive and totally believable design of the world of Pandora, the animal creatures and the Na'vi, making Pandora a place worth visiting. Talking about that I think that so far of all of the movies I've ever seen in my life I think that Avatar is the film that's the most technically original. Another interesting thing in this movie is the fact that the main character played by Sam Worthington is an ordinary character and is completely new to the moon of Pandora but through an unexpected twist of fate becomes a leader that transforms the world as he unexpectedly switches sides to the good and right side and that's something which made the movie feel bigger, better and more effective. If people asked me what should be the most admired thing in this film I would reply to them that it is its visual effects, design of the creatures, the world of Pandora and the Na'vi and its wonderful use of 3D which fortunately doesn't distract the audience from the central tale. Storytelling should have been the one though. My rating for Avatar: 7.9/10",positive
826,"I was very moved by this film. I saw it as an allegory of what the whites did to the natives in North America, South America, Australia, New Zea land and Tasmania (especially there)--almost complete genocide for the sake of monetary profit by corporate magnates. And since corporations are the real power in developed countries: they have carte blanche to kill as needed. They usually are clever in creating a body of lies that help to dehumanize the victims. (Easier to kill 'em).The way to drive such a principle home, which means into the heart AND the head, is to show both sides. So we see the natives, Navi, in their culture which includes art, mythology, dance, music, and meaningful rituals. You can come to love any culture (even white European) if you are exposed to this side of humans. And in so doing, it would become horrible to wipe them out for the sake of a fat bank account back home. That is what Cameron does. He gets you on the side of the humanity, in this case, the Navi. (We already know about the dark side of homo Sapiens but it is well sketched in here by the mercenary grunts. I think DANCES WITH WOLVES tells much the same story. There the corporate element stays in the background which was OK for that film.I was like a little boy visiting a heaven-like world with ""people"" who were conscious of other things besides money and power. In the back of my mind I wondered that any race could be that harmonious. North American ""Indians"" treated other tribes horribly in most areas like on the the Plains and conducted raids and wars where there was much cruelty. (See the film THE BLACK ROBE, for a New England version of this.) Were the Navi like that? And what if they were? I guess the question is greed. Given the means would some Navi have exterminated other tribes and gotten rich? They didn't seem to need to be rich.So are all intelligent bipedal creatures alike? I once heard a theory about why there are no space travelers from beyond--if they became as intelligent as we, they'd also encounter the same jealousies and greed that we have, thus preventing them from combining their resources and cooperating--the infighting would bar them from space travel.A wonderful epic film. The love story was poetic. The creatures were beautiful and scary. So were the plants. The hero started off a klutz but grew on me. And I liked hearing Wes Studi's voice again. He was the ""bad"" Indian in DANCES as he was in LAST OF THE MAHICANS.",positive
827,James Cameron what is the point of this film what the heck was this anyway and 2 hour long boring physcho movie about blue Indians and that's it what the hell is this crap. I turned off the television I couldn't take it anymore of how overrated and terrible the film was and disgusting. What do you think making a movie that copies idea over other great movies mix them together and makes a junk movie what is this. This is he highest grossing movie of all time. WHY dear god? People actually payed to see this crap. WHY? People used to loved this garbage movie but now is bad. Overrated piece of crap.

Many people will say how wrong i am and how amazing this movie is and how it is the best movie of all time. hopefully these people only watched it and didn't listen to it.",negative
829,"James is God, and has created a world for us, in the year 2154, on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri system. This moon's inhabitants called the Na'vi are struggling with the arrival of our own species, the humans.The story is remarkable, not in the sense of originality, but in feeling. What do I mean feeling? I'll tell you.The Beauty of Feeling Cinema: When Jake (Sam Worthington) first enters his avatar, for the first time in the history of film, I experienced what I'll call breaking the wall of realism.I'm not talking about the graphic effects purely as well, sure it is a HUGE part of the experience, but what I'm getting at is that we (the viewers)are subjected to the experiences he has in this new body. As a paraplegic, he has this new found experience, this new world sucking him in, and it's a uplifting and applies so well in the film standard.The way Cameron compares the viewer to the realizations of Jake Sully are unparalleled. He puts you into his skin more or less, letting the world of Pandora swallow you up, chase you, curse you, and then what you see, is that this place is worth fighting for. And that is what happens, you want to fight for Pandora.Luckily, your fight only requires watching the story unfold, but it is so involving, that I felt wonder. Yes, pure wonder. The scenes of wonder are limitless, and most of the great wonders hardly contain dialog and oddly enough, the dialog is the weakest part of the film, though it really doesn't matter. We experience the world of Pandora.The flying scenes are the most spectacular display of cinema submersion I've ever seen...This movie is visually and psycologically beautiful in ways most movies could only dream. It isn't perfect, what is? And yes, there will be a lot of opinion about its stature as a huge production.No one can deny that it is entertaining for many, and I'm not trying to win it a battle, opinions are what they are, but for the majority of people less concerned with complex plots and new story gimmicks, that just want a good ol' time at the movie theater. James delivers.10/10 Excellent Film Making is Excellent",positive
830,"I just saw the movie in IMAX 3D. I can't believe the movie ended in 3 hours. The movie is so captivating that you want the story to continue. Hats off to James Cameron! Now that I am outside the movie hall. I just feel like I am missing something. Call it special effects or what ever. The night life of Pandora was simply breathtaking. The florescent effects were marvelous. The flora and the fauna of Pandora were quite intriguing, especially the plant which closes in on touching. Mountains floating in the air, though Newton wouldn't have agreed, but it would rather be amazing to live in such world. The story takes you to another dimension. There's no doubt that I'm gonna watch the movie again. But I'm just out of luck, since movie tickets aren't available. I believe the long break which James Cameron took after Titanic, was worth it. The movie deserves more than 8.5 IMDb rating.",positive
831,"Although I didn't thought my smile could be any bigger as it was today since it was snowing here the first time this year, Avatar made it happen.But what other feeling could I have just after watching a movie what gives me the wooow feeling every shot. Everything I experienced was so beautiful, so perfect. Mother nature making her best movie appearance ever.Even though I was really excited watching the trailer, I noticed I had to be a little bit more careful with trailers these days. It wouldn't have been the first time this year I had seen a great trailer but being highly disappointed watching the full movie. Fortunately Avatar made the expectations come true, and although I have to agree the storyline might be a little bit cliché... I really couldn't care less, how this has been worked out I doubt it could have been done any better.Although I have to admit first seeing some of the characters I was a little bit afraid some would be to stereotype and wouldn't fit in quite well. But I was wrong, the cast has done a really great job acting, absolutely giving me the feeling every single character should belong in this movie.This and a lot more I can't explain are the reasons you should go to the theaters whenever you have the chance. Avatar can't be described by words only, you have to take the journey to Pandora and experience it yourself. It will not let you down.8.5 Stars",positive
832,"I used to think that Lord of the Rings was THE achievement in the film industry. Then I saw Avatar..The word ""wow"" doesn't begin to describe this masterpiece. First, let me start out by saying that the script was NOT bad. It wasn't superb either, like LOTR or the other classics, it was just good. However, with the added graphics, it became great.A lot of people complain about Cameron's propaganda in this movie and that's alright. However, if Cameron's main idea was to get his propaganda across, he failed miserably. He should have made an average movie to get people to listen"". Instead, he made the most revolutionary film in the history of movies, and I doubt anyone really paid attention to his ""message"".The romance and chemistry between the cgi Jake Sully and Ney'tiri was in my mind, on the level of Jack and Rose in Titanic, or any of the greatest romances in movie history. Furthermore, as a conservative, it was easy for me to cheer for the underdog natives in this film. I wouldn't really use it as an allegory for native Americans or any of the other wars, because that would be ignorant.In conclusion, this movie was ""it"". It may not be The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, or the Green Mile, but it was easily the most entertaining movie I have EVER seen, and I've seen it 3 times already. Everyone get out there and watch it. James Cameron is the best.",positive
833,"After a year of reading or listening to others' opinion I released why is this movie so successful. It has achieved very simple goals - simple entertainment, thrills, laughters and feeling for the protagonist.I also realized that the real hero in Avatar is not Jake but the Na'vis are all the heroes. Sure they had an adult male, warrior who had laughed at Jake almost always but he was likable at least. Also the natives almost killed themselves when they tried to save one woman's life which is honorable.The Na'vis are still amazing. There's a lot of dialogue where the good guys are making the natives look weak and the planet precious but this image comes to turn upside down making the natives and Pandora much more than that. That's where Cameron's genius lies except for the amazing visuals. Like in his Terminator movies he gives the out-of-this-world beings a simple feature or motivation until the end where you have to realize it is more complex you believed. I almost started to cheer loudly at the twist in the end.If you watch only at how amazingly the movie looks or the various creatures and sites Cameron came up with you are missing the real meaning of the story. Of course it's not so original for a feature film but there are times you are pleased with GENERIC fantasy plots and not ones that top dramas with deep characters.This movie is important for me so please stop bashing it for being successful. It's one thing you don't like or understand it.",neutral
834,"Avatar has got to be the most overrated movie of all time.By its self its just okay but not worthy of all the praise. Yes, its fun to look at but I don't care if its in 3D or using CGI. In the end it always comes back to story and that is ware it failed. This is one of the most predictable movies I have seen on the big screen. For those of you who read a lot of books or watch older films You pretty much know this story.I know what the Avatar Fans who will thumd down this review are thinking. They are most likely thinking ""But a lot of books and movies borrow from older stories"" or ""There no such thing as a true original story"" Well this is what I have to say to them. Yes its true a lot of the things we loved were influenced by older work but they all stood on there own. When I see those character I don't see a cardboard copy and past cliché cut out like in this. Pluse there is a fine line between influenced and flat out stealing. Avatar made no attempt to stand on its own as a Story. Instead it just follows every cliché in the book.I also have a few questions for every who loved this movie and I really want you to think about your answer. If it was a book, meaning all you had was the story, would you love it as much? If it was made on a really low budget would you love it as much? If the SFX were really poor but everything els (story, script, actors) was the same, would you love it as much? When the fad dies down and better special effects are every were all we will have left is generic scifi movie. Nothing more and nothing less.Yes it looks great but the story, acting and duologue all suck.There I said it! Now Bring on the Hate!!!",neutral
835,"Thinking about it more carefully, what I disliked the most were the religious representations of the movie, and how that appeals to the minds of those with insufficient critical skills.There's a deity, Eywa, which is some sort of brain, whereas the trees are the connections like synapses. So everything is interconnected through some sort of energy. And the deity is real, it provides not only wisdom but it also joins the fight when the tide turns. And it heals people. Or it doesn't, but it's still all for the better. And because they're one with nature, they're horrified when the tree is felled, because there's a supernatural meaning to it. And there are even initiation rites.And I'm here thinking that initiation rites have such potential for physical and emotional abuse; that healing people with energy is a deeply dangerous idea; that holding hands in prayer is utterly useless for all practical purposes; and that accepting that a woman has a ""connection"" with God, or Eywa, is so supportive of every other religious leader out there.""It's a tribe, and it's a movie"", someone will say. But it's in fact a kind of utopic tribalism, an idea that will be attractive to many people - it has been for most of the history of mankind - but that is seriously outdated for the societies we're hoping to build, one in which we accept each other's cultural traits and deal with our many flaws. There is no tribe out there that is perfect in every way and about to be victimized by evil foreigners. There isn't. The tribes of the world are nothing like that, they're definitely not noble like that. In fact, they're based on fraudulent religious power and authoritarian political power. Tribalism and its tenets have no place in our world, and it worries me to see it so glorified on the big screen.(Another poor message: Everybody in the tribe holds hands in prayer, right after an attack. They're lost and frightened, and it takes a foreigner to instill them courage! The deity didn't do that, their own people didn't do that, in fact there was some in-fight, so it took the most recent member of the tribe, with a ""human"" mentality, to lead them into victory. Sure, the human asks for cooperation of the tribe members and specially of the alpha-male, but he's the leader. How boring, we've seen that so many times. If the tribe itself had decided to fight back, and if Jake had simply joined them... I would have liked that. It would be less of a blockbuster, but more mature).Therefore, stunning visuals aside, the morals of the film are so flawed that I'll give it only 6 stars out of 10.",neutral
836,"I am an avid sci-fi reader from the days of the 10 cent paperbacks. One of my anthology collections had this story in it, almost verbatim. But that being said, it is a wonderful, rollicking, happy and sad film. The special effects were hard to believe, going far beyond the Star Wars and Lord of The Rings series'. I do agree that the female character neytiri was quite attractive. Sitting next to my wife in the theater here in the Philippines (I am on extended vacation) I pointed out to her how much the character looked like she does. It is always fun to see the actor's face without the makeup, and HOW DID THEY DO THOSE EYES??? Someone was asking me if there might be a sequel, and I suppose it could happen, maybe a ""revenge of the earthlings"" type scenario...but regardless this film is extraordinary, even if totally borrowed from old sci-fi. Some day I will remember who wrote the story and relate it here. For now..GO SEE THIS FILM!!",positive
837,"I went in not expecting very much from Avatar having seen the trailers and reading about the story and of course I was right not to expect much. This movie is a bad Saturday morning cartoon. It's too long and too boring. It rips off too many other movies. If you're going to use a story that has been done too many times i.e Pocohontas, Dances with Wolves, The Matrix,even District Nine you'd better have either a compelling star (that is someone we want to see in this movie) or a twist that is interesting. This movie didn't have either of those things. Also you know I wish that writers would really take a good look at their material before they turn it over for use. The dialog was terrible. Too much narration, you know you're in trouble with a story when you need narration to move the story along. The visuals were nice but we've seen if all before, nothing new here at all. I only gave it a six for the pretty colors.",neutral
838,"10 out of 10 for Visual Effects but 3 out of 10 for everything else.8.9? Seriously? Is this movie really THAT good? I saw Avatar yesterday in Cannes and I was lucky to have free tickets or I would have felt robbed after wards.Don't get me wrong. The visual effects are really well done, impressive and beautiful. Even amazing at some points. It was in fact the first movie where I felt like the 3D actually added something of value.But what happened to the rest of the stuff that makes up a good movie? Things like innovative script, believable drama, interesting non- stereotypic characters, the surprise of the unexpected happening and just a wee bit of logic (at least just a little, sometimes). This piece of junk didn't even have humor, which is usually a good last resort if all other of the above fails.Apart from the visual effects, Avatar was the biggest load of stinking cheese i have consumed since I-don't-know-when (and I live in the land of stinking cheese). It seems to blindly follow all and every classic Hollywood guide line for making movies, no exceptions. It made me wonder if the script was generated by algorithm. After the first 30 minutes, when the slightly interesting setting is understood, it becomes so painfully predictive and cheesy that I strongly believe that I would have enjoyed it more without any voice audio at all. And, yes, I was watching it with original voices (not French).If the combat scenes were to be removed it would make a wonderful little children's movie, for 6 to 13 year olds. They should seriously consider doing that.If you like ultra cheesy movies OR like CGI tech (like me) and believe you can survive a flood of cheese (unlike me) for the sake of CGI, go see it now! It will be totally pointless to watch on Bluray at home.Otherwise, you can definitively spend your money more wisely this Christmas.",negative
839,"I have just rewatched it, last time i watched it was 12 years at age 15 and i forgot 95% of it. The messege it's sending is that corporate greed is evil and how if we were to become space fairing civilization, the capitalist drive for wealth could potentially destroy alien species and their habitats. It really opens the eyes how much it translate to real life. It shows how little corporations care about science, culture, life of alien people and the environment they destroy. The world in this movie is just so beautiful, so many cool visual things. The avatar character is very well made. Excited for the next Avatar movies.",positive
840,"""Avatar"" is like nothing you have seen before, and perhaps the signature of things to come. ""Avatar"" is beautifully stunning. In one scene Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) ride winged creatures as they careen through the Floating Mountains of Pandora. Breathtaking. I saw ""Avatar"" in Real 3D, and it is spectacular and amazing. The visual 3D is seamless—""Avatar"" is just a gorgeous movie to watch. Director and Writer James Cameron tells the story of the transformation of hero. As envisioned by Cameron, the hero Jake emerges out of his tribe and nature's cyber network. Grace (strong Sigourney Weaver) points out that the Na'vi are networked through the trees of Pandora; thus, having more connections than the human brain.""Avatar"" is like American Indian mythology where the people see the value of harmony with the spirit of the land, and being protectors of it. Sam Worthington as Jake is compassionate and commanding in his journey of the hero. As in most classic stories, he is a reluctant hero at first. Beautiful and strong Na'vi Neytiri (Saldana) tells Jake's avatar after saving his life, ""You have a strong heart. Fearless And so stupid!"" Jake (Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine in the year 2154 sent to Pandora to participate in an experiment. Jake replaces his twin brother, who was a scientist that had died, as Avatar for his Na'vi body. He along with lead scientist Grace (Weaver) become avatars for bodies grown from Na'vi and human DNA. The Na'vi are the tribal people that inhabit the planet Pandora which is light years from earth. Pandora possesses the mineral Unobtainium (kind of cheesy) that is worth millions of dollars on earth. The Na'vi live on a tree over the largest source of the precious ore. The Na'vi are blue skinned beautiful and sinuous people standing 10 feet tall. And according to Marine Col. Miles Quaritch (awesome Stephen Lang) the Na'vi also have carbon fiber skeletal structures which makes them ""very hard to kill"". Jake is part of the diplomatic solution. However, Quaritch enlists Jake as his Marine Na'vi to learn about the enemy and distinguish their weakness. In return Jake gets his legs back.Jake as Na'vi soon finds himself falling in love with the stunningly beautiful Neytiri (Saldana), daughter of Shaman Chief Eytukan (Wes Studi). Jake becomes Na'vi, and sees the value of this noble people, and their spiritual and physical bond to Pandora itself. So the Avatar of the cyber world must choose whether he becomes the Avatar, chosen one, of his new people. In this Cameron's storytelling is compelling. Worthington is strong and compassionate. Saldana is noble and vulnerable. Their chemistry is amazing as Jake confesses to Neytiri, ""I see you.""""Avatar"" apparently cost $300 million dollars to make. I understand since inception about 10 years ago along with development of motion capture technology the cost may approach half a billion dollars. Looks like all that effort has been worth it. We truly get the emotions of the actors in their expression. The Na'vi move so languidly and fluidly. Cameron's ""Avatar"" is a visually stunning and classic hero story—the likes of which have never been seen before.",positive
841,"I came back from an IMax ""Avatar"" screening a couple of hours ago.It was snowing outside, so I just tried to watch up the sky and imagine I'm at the theater again and I'm enjoying the Movie again.Because this IS the Movie.One of the year's finest, if not THE Finest.I was absolutely taken into the story and than blown away by everything-the characters, the nature. the visuals, the emotion...The whole idea as well.The alien concept is very strong.The planet's concept as well.All the action is happening in the Alpha Centauri A Solar System, on one of the moons orbiting a giant gas planet called Polyphemus.There are many moons around Polyphemus, but the most important of all is Pandora, where everything takes place on.Polyphemus is visible in Pandora's sky, as well as a few other moons orbiting around the gas giant.I'll leave you to visualize the whole world of Pandora-beautiful rain forests and planets filling the skies.And because of the new world Cameron has created, it all seemed a reality.Everything had this typical Cameron touch, a touch to the very last detail.All of his movies deserve to be seen, and ""Avatar"" won't disappoint as well.It really changes the course of worldwide cinema, because Cameron's genius has created not only a believable plot, but a humanoid one.To destroy something that beautiful and innocent, that's only in our nature.And we quickly begin to take the Na'vi side.They're the indigenous population of Pandora.And you feel as every single moment of the movie is something new, kind of unpredictable and unique-not because of the story, but because of the environment, the nature, the Na'vi people and the feelings and emotions throughout.You will get literally in love with all the characters.And surprisingly, only a few of them are humans.You'll love Neytiri the most.The Na'vi princess is so beautiful that you'll be left dreaming of her and the world she lives in.The emotions she express are more real than the emotions the humans are expressing throughout.Although based on CGI, Zoe Saldana plays Neytiri beautifully and her role is one of the strongest, if not the strongest in the whole movie.Sigourney Weaver is strong and shines as well.Sam Worthington and the rest of the cast are also very good and convincing.You'll even have the feeling those People are real.That Neytiri and Jake are real, because they look as real, if not even more real, than the humans.And again, all thanks to James Cameron, who brought to life the Na'vi People and made them look in many aspects better than the humans.And that's one of the strengths of the movie.James Cameron is a genius and an artist and ""Avatar"" could be his biggest masterpiece yet!!! I'm happy I saw it at an IMax theater, and I'll definitely do it again.It just deserves to be seen again and again, at a theater.""Avatar"" is ""numero uno"" at my top 5 list of the year and definitely among my top 3 list ever!Why not even at first...I loved the movie and I'm sure you'll do as well!!! God bless James Cameron and his latest Masterpiece! 10/10 of course!",positive
842,A truly brilliant film making success that has set an entirely new level for films across the planet. The 3D experience was truly inspiring and has set a new benchmark for other film makers across the globe. Others have now changed their plans and tried to put their films into a 3D quality but it can never really match it. Stephen Lang should have won the Oscar for for best supporting actor and Zoe Saldana should have won best actress. The academy have really lost the plot this time. This is the Best Motion Picture not only this year but for the past decade. The Hurt Locker got the sympathy vote because it made next to nothing.,positive
843,"I hate it when people do this ! They go see a movie, stare at the mind blowing CGI, which this movie had plenty of, and they think that its the best movie ever made. Well its not. But its also not a bad movie, its has a great cast..meaning mostly Sigourney Weaver. Im not saying that all the other actor did bad, they did a good job, but Sigourney Weaver just gave the movie this essence that made it shine, i don't know if I'm the only one who thinks so but those are my thoughts. For me its only a 7/10, but that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth watching, its definitely a great action movie but its just so predictable that it makes the story line boring. OK, so lets do a recap...Best movie of the year ? Hell no ! A great action movie that you can enjoy ? Hell Yes.",positive
844,"I am not going to insist on the technical prowess and creativity of this film. The special effects, both visual and sound, are superb, sublime, perfect, the merger of Star Wars and Matrix, of all the best means ever devised to make our eyes and ears believe the unbelievable. James Cameron is a god of sorts in that field and he used the most advanced studios to produce a divine and magical fairy tale. Anyone who pretends to love the cinema cannot and must not ever be reluctant in the slightest way to go and watch that film, two or three times if possible. And James Cameron is just as good when he deals with the surreal and supernatural of this extra-terrestrial civilization and when he exposes the brutality and human underdevelopment with no hope to ever be emerging from their dumbness of both military higher-ups and greedy industrialists. To list and explain all the allusions to all the films you can and will recognize would need two hundred pages. So I will pass and trust your own knowledge to enjoy the many allusions. I want to insist on the central message of the film, both ideological and cultural. Americans arriving on this planet finds a humanoid species, both intelligent and developed, but in a direction that has kept and exploited the direct relation that every individual can entertain with the beasts of nature and the telluric or subterranean forces of nature seen as the mother of the equilibrium without which nothing can survive. The only aim of the Americans is to recuperate some ore that is in great quantities under the main home-tree of this species, under all the sacred places and natural temples of this civilization, and to use brutal force if necessary to clear the area. Greed and death instinct are the two teats on which all these Americans have been fed. Genetic science makes it possible to invest the personality of a human into the genetically modified cloned body of a local humanoid, producing a spy who is to get into this community and bring back the information necessary for the military genocide while his human body is kept in some hibernating pod. The problem with that project is that the happy few who can thus get into that community fall in love with their civilization, their culture, their deep human feelings and their absolute cult of prowess, courage and intelligence invested in the full respect of mother nature. Eventually for one of them that love will mean falling in love with the daughter of the political (father) and religious (mother) leaders of the tribe. James Cameron is a genius in the way he depicts the strong human emotions on the American side, both negative and positive and this depicting is immediately effective on us who are well trained in reading, receiving and experiencing these emotions. We feel the full horror James Cameron wants us to feel in front of the ugly conquistador colonel and the admirable courage of this female marine who prefers betraying her camp to being part of a planned genocide. James Cameron tries hard to depict in the same way the extra-terrestrial feeling and emotions of these humanoids, both real and cloned, but there we feel them less because they are different and we are not in phase with them, especially since the special effects are making us slightly blind. But it remains absolutely sublime. The meaning here is that of the meeting of two human species and their divided objectives on both sides. It is the merging of the two species in order to produce collaboration, cooperation, exchange and even total gift of culture, technological power, natural knowledge, spiritual representations, and all other common or different domains. In other words we are dealing with the fascination of the other. Some call that inverted racism or mixing cultures, salad bowl or melting pot, integration or assimilation. But James Cameron shows us how that approach is dangerous and fatal for the weaker species who will always be the victim of the stronger species, understood as being the Americans who have no word of honor when greed is in play. At the same time if we do not respect the other in its total personality, religion and religious beliefs included, we will only produce a genocide, be it at least a cultural genocide teaching English and imposing our culture, and negating the natural evolution of the differentiation of languages, the punishment of the tower of Babel in our religious lore. James Cameron is telling us a parable more than a fable, and he is in perfect line with the deepest Judeo-Christian tradition of ours, of the Christ who was rabbi Jesus before being crucified. That deepest belief of ours is called love: to love the other in his or her difference and to give to that other all we have and share it with him or her, expecting the same attitude on the other side but at the same time refusing violence in the other case and loving our ""enemies"" as much as our ""friends"". In other words, and to cut short a long story, this film is the First Gospel after Barack Hussein Obama's election, even if that new spiritual approach of the world did not produce a miracle in Copenhagen. The Second Gospel of this Obama era will be the announced film by Steven Spielberg on the last novel by Stephen King, Under the Dome. After Saint James, the first Bishop of Jerusalem and the elder brother of Jesus in the end stoned to death at the foot of the wall of Jerusalem, we will have Saint Stephen, the Protomartyr of Christianity, stoned to death on the encouragement of Saul of Tarsus, the future Paul.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",positive
845,"After all the hype and all the Oscar noms I decided to give this a try. I watched it on my laptop(sue me) so i didn't get to grasp the entire visual array of it. But I've seen enough effect driven movies that I don't even really care about it anymore. So this movie made me very disappointed, I was laughing for a good portion of the movie as every scene boiled down. I was inches away from turning it off. I was just so.... I'll boil it down The Goods-The world is captivating and gorgeous. It's a jungle like land filled with very interesting creatures and very amazing scenery. The general theme of the movie(Despite the fact that it is Pocohantas) is always a heart warming one. Well, that's about it for goods. Bads-Terrible clichés left and right. I as a I writer couldn't help myself by calling some of them out. The entire goal of the army itself is one massive cliché. Most of the characters act in clichés. The typical badass leader. The typical arrogant technical guidance guy. They even stole the scene from Apocalypse Now(The scene where Duvall is riding in a helicopter with a cup of coffee.) The dialogue is terrible. Nothing memorable about it. Thank god it didn't get nominated for best script. The last 45 minutes is pure retardation. Why on earth would you drop bombs on area filled with your own men? Why did they eve go down to the ground? Why do they have knives if they have guns? Why didn't they just fireball everything like they did with the tree? Why did a bunch of primitive horse riding blue people manage to take down a far superior society? All these things made me cringe. Also, for the first half of the movie the plot is extremely thin. most of it was to form the relationship between the main character and the love interest. But for a sci-fi fantasy style movie you should always put story first, instead Cameron did this to show off the world without really providing a lot for the story. And to be honest every character in this movie is incredibly flat and boring. non of them have back stories except for Jake. And non of them are very interesting at a character standpoint. I never for the life of me understood how a human who barely fought in the wars could lead this tribe which obviously showed some superiority.I give this movie a 4/10. Mark my words, it will be forgotten once the next shiny movie comes out. All in all, it has the same effect that Independence Day had. Awesome Visuals, aliens, massive budget. The only difference is that ID had enjoyable characters. But it had a terrible ending and also suffered from the clichés.",neutral
846,"The realism. The depth of all the characters. The feeling of you walking along with the heroes of the movie. This is something different. This is not regular theater.It is not even 3D-RedBlue-classic-glasses-theater (which comes with a headache as most of us know).This might seem like an insider comment, but I just had to write this, and get it out. I finished watching the movie twenty minutes ago.This movie completely changed my outlook on 3D movies. If before it I doubted somehow, that these movies are our future, now I am completely sure, that if more movies like this one are made, the theater will advance, and will follow.I am afraid of thinking what an experience so powerful might do to people. I myself do not know what to do next, I gotta go to sleep, because I am afraid that anything else I do right now, will ruin the pictures I keep seeing again and again from the movie.This movie is a must, whether you like any type of movies, any style of animation, or anything at all.It's like a new type of entertainment. One step closer to virtual reality perhaps? (of course it's far from it, but this is as close as we have EVER been to it).",positive
847,"Rarely have I seen a more nauseatingly bad movie than James Cameron's Titanic. It lingers within your stomach like a bad oyster, but longer. On the other hand, Avatar lingers with you like a good movie should, leaving a deep impression on your spirit.The CGI are used effectively and enjoyably, but most importantly, in a way that enhances the story, and not just for the sake of sensationalism.However, it is worth asking how good this movie would be without CGI? The script is good but not great, the acting good but not great. So it would probably rate a 6. What you have, in essence, is a Western, a cowboys and Indians type story, but with the Indians as the good guys, much like Dances with Wolves. It is these black and white characterizations that are the weakness of Avatar.But the CGI, alone, rates a solid 10. The effects in the movie are impeccable. One review claimed the 3D disappeared at points, but I think that was probably due to theater equipment malfunction.Some guests on NPR tried to accuse the movie of racism, with the blue people as stand ins for Blacks. Huh? That's absurd. Too bad the host had not seen the movie. The bad guys, mainly the general and the corporate flunky, are white. If only they had been portrayed with at least a slightly troubled conscience they would have had more believability.Fortunately, the movie does have characters whose consciences bother them, so it doesn't turn into a comic book, like Titanic. There is character development in both the humans and those blue people, the Navi. There is also a sufficiently complex plot to save it from the level of Titanic. And then there is Sigourney Weaver, a fine actress, who gives the otherwise schmaltzy movie bite.From what I have heard of the technical complexity of making this movie, the actors deserve credit for doing such a good job in the face of such artificial conditions. I couldn't have done it. These are not big names, yet they generally did solid work.One thing this movie has in common with Titanic is the way over the top gushing from many reviewers, too many. Frankly, there must have been a significant amount of paid buzz surrounding Titanic, and I think we are seeing it again with Avatar. This is standard PR operating procedure, going back at least to the Beatles, who had PR people who paid teenage girls to faint whenever they heard them play, to be taken to ambulances also on the PR payroll. (And then there are online reviewers who seem to hate Cameron with a vengeance.)When Titanic was finally released, I think the press reviewers felt pressured not to pan such an expensive, pre-hyped movie. In retrospect, the reviewers were too kind to that turkey. But this time, I think they are actually a bit too critical, perhaps to make up for Titanic, and perhaps knowing a critical review will do little damage at the box office. While Avatar will never be listed alongside of Casablanca or Citizen Kane for its script, it will be a movie that will be remembered and watched for years to come.So, bottom line, this is a movie you MUST watch in a movie theater because of the 3D, so go when you can see it in a theater with really good equipment. (Not all showings are in 3D, though. I don't think it is worth bothering seeing in 2D.)",positive
848,"Since Avatar was supposed to be such a ground-breaking cinematic experience, I thought I'd treat myself and go watch it at the local drive-in theater with my dog and two year old daughter. Boy, am I sorry I mad that mistake! Not only is the movie boring as hell, it also doesn't have an ounce of originality. James Camrom, next time you make a blatant rip-off of Pocahontas, could you please at least try to make it interesting?And the CGI, it's atrocious! I thought the fan boys at work said it was a 'visual feast', whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Well, it turns out that it isn't a lot more realistic that Jurasic Park, which was released over two decades ago now.It was so boring that an hour and a half into it my daughter was literally crying and my dog had taken to chewing up the back seat of my brand new Mercedes-Benz C-Class. So not only did it cost me the price of a ticket (which would have been a rip-off in itself), it also cost me a new back seat. Thanks a lot, James Camrom.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this disaster. I'm giving this atrocity 0 out of 10 stars.",negative

For the first time I actually felt a part of this amazing cinematic experience. The visuals in general were stunning. They make films like Transformers look like last decade's stuff.The story was great, but the characters are what make it what it is. The characters make you want a future franchise. I felt the same way with the original Star Wars movie characters. I found myself actually rooting for some of the characters to survive.I hope potential film makers will look to this in the future.

Going in, I was a bit skeptical, being that the mineral was called ""Unobtainium"", which I found to be a bit laughable and had me worrying that the movie was going to be a bit of a joke with names. However, the movie did not disappoint. Pandora was a vibrant and living world, every single plant was designed beautifully and felt almost real. The Na'vi were also designed extremely well, and the CG made them appear to be real in all respects. The biggest fear I had was the 3-D aspect, what I expected to be the gimmick, where I would have an arrow fly by my face and water splash at me. This was not the case. it was truly immersive. I felt that I was looking out a window and seeing another world, one in which these people and creatures were actually existing.All in all, James Cameron has made another masterpiece, and I can not wait for the extended materials.I guess that is what happens when you spend 4 years in production, 6 in creating the 3-D cameras, 15 creating the story, and a lifetime imagining the world.",positive

I saw Avatar at the IMAX in London and it was utterly amazing. I have seen it twice (both times at the IMAX), and worried that the second time round would be boring and predictable, I was amazed to find that I enjoyed it EVEN more than I had the first time. I noticed so many more things that I had not seen the first time round.I think that criticism of the storyline itself, the Na'vi language, it's predictability etc. should not even be considered or explored - the film is incredible, and I would only recommend seeing at at the IMAX.The attention to detail in this film is just phenomenal - right down to little flies going across the very bottom of the screen, and the illusion of an x000ft drop. If you didn't enjoy Avatar then I presume that you don't enjoy a great number of things in life. It is a film, and a make-believe story and I think that it is vital to remember this, rather than critically assessing the faults of the language etc.Still amazing to see, and still showing at the IMAX. Go and see Avatar!",positive

I assumed it was a joke, then understood it was not. Then I thought, it'll get better. Then Sigourney Weaver came on and proved yet again that she's a really dismal actor. She is so awfully artificial, it's painful. Then the blue things came on, and I tried, but I soon realized that these effects were the film's big attractions. No, I couldn't watch much more. Cameron is utterly tired and wearily predictable, and the only, and I mean, ONLY thing that could've made this macho/sci fi mess bearable would have been Sam Worthington playing naked.",neutral

With the amateur actors Cameroon wins hands down with his script and the breathtaking graphics. 3D is a gift to the flick. Do a favor by watching it in 3d. The character development is very good and how Cameroon fits his protagonist into the Pandora is a great example. The following training he undergoes in Pandora is a treat to watch.Cameroon takes the universal subject of love in different planet and moves the pieces accordingly. At one point of time we are feeling pity for the Pandora's people and that's the victory Cameroon achieved. The final fight between the Navis and US army is one of the longest fights employing missiles and on the other hand dragon's and alien creatures using bow and arrows. As in King Kong, different species of animals join the league to fight. Its a treat to watch and indeed its a magic created in screen.""Avatar"" will be remembered for its technical finesse, the grandiose it offers, the CG and 3d effects which captures the beauty of Pandora, the breathtaking visuals and last but not the least, its honest people created by the man Cameroon.

855,"I don't consider Avatar to be the best film ever made but it has probably been the most vivid, consuming, immersive cinematic experience for me. I saw it 5 times during its first run (4 times in IMAX) and now again the re-release. Even though I like it on TV I can safely say that who haven't seen Avatar in IMAX 3D, haven't seen it at all.Avatar's story is simple, archetypal and allows you to be consumed by the beautiful world that James Cameron created. CGI is better than in all currently released films and the 4K remaster looks gorgeous.The fact that the highest grossing film is an original story speaks for it self - such a success is unprecedented (no other original film besides Avatar and Titanic is in top 15) and only film providing cinematic experience of such magnitude could have achieved it.",positive
856,"Hype was somewhat overblown. The 3-D is amazing, but does not appear throughout the movie. There are stretches where you notice there isn't any 3-D, then it appears again, but not for very long.I think the picture has a great message that is very pertinent to our current world, in which we are ruining our environment with little regard for how it affects those living in the rain forests, oceans, etc.I know that Cameron had a real language created for ""Avatar"", and that adds an interesting other-worldliness to the film.I felt the movie was moving along at a fairly steady pace until the last 40 minutes or so, when the story kind of bogged down.If you are a big fan of sci-fi films, I would recommend the picture, and that you see it in 3-D, which definitely adds to the appeal of the film. The IMAX 3-D might enhance the movie's enjoyability, but was too pricey for us.",neutral
857,"(Prepare for a long read) What to say, just bloody awesome.When I had seen the trailer for Avatar my mind was at conflict as to whether or not I thought it would surmount to being worth a watch. On the one hand this film is directed by an outstanding director who is responsible for many films that hold a special place in my heart. On the other, the trailer, on appearance, gave away so little that all I picked up was that at least I would not be disappointed by the special effects. So, with mind made I decided that the special effects at least where enough to buy me.What I rate here after seeing the movie is what I'd describe as being an epic fantasy in league with the Lord of the Rings. I say fantasy because really this has more elements in common with great fantasy movie than that of sci-fi, though it also bears those unmistakable hints of a 'nam war movie that only James Cameron could pull through.Talking about the special effects that bought me they certainly don't let down and 3D just brings out all the gorgeous glory of this film. Though some of the more movement based shots couldn't quite seem to adjust right to the 3D, this most definitely did not spoil the movie. The soundtrack is amazing and really brings out the emotion of the movie - yet it isn't solely relied upon and some of the most gut-wrenching scenes are delivered by that all important character building.The plot & acting are what really sums this up for me, don't be fooled at the beginning by what seems to be your averagely decent movie because as the film progresses some really subtle but key story vices are brought into play that bring the film up to its roaring climax. Crunchy and inventive action/battle scenes as well as beautiful romance, great story, amazing scenery and that (as I've already said) all important character building that forms an attachment between you and the character are all more than ample reasons that people of all audiences will enjoy & should go to see Avatar! If anything I'm not disappointed that I went to see it and am already planning to see it again.On a final note, the rather interesting and different ending this film has puts it on a standing point above all other sci-fi that raises thoughts as to the nature of humanity.Many thanks to James Cameron, for an outstanding film that I hope to soon see on the top 250 movies of IMDb. Also for including many of my favourite recently discovered actors.",positive
858,"There are two features of Avatar that left an impression, the graphics and plot. The run up to the movie concentrated on the technical breakthroughs which were needed to make the film - unfortunately I did not see it in 3D so can't comment on that component. However while the melding of actors and computer generated images was interesting, I didn't find it more astonishing than the special effects technology of prior films. I happened to see parts of the 1956 Moby Dick the following day, for example, which was instructive - the technology available then was relatively primitive but was very convincing, as was King Kong, made still earlier, because the movies were so well made and written; bells and whistles alone are not sufficient to make a great movie. Which leads me to the next issue, the plot. It was the basic premise of evil corporation (or nation) vs the innocent indigenous population. While that certainly has historical and present day validity, the writing was so broad and the plot points so obvious that one lost interest, knowing exactly where this was heading and how things would turn out. I was ultimately left with the feeling that I had seen a political cartoon rather than an interesting movie.",neutral
859,"This movie was a treat to the eye, and that was about where the hype ended for me. The CGI effects were through the roof and amazingly nice to look at.The story, the plot, the characters? Well, they were taken straight out of a ""how to make a Hollywood action movie"" book. There was nothing here that haven't been seen in a bunch of other movies. Actually, Avatar seems to be a million dollar remake of the ""Battle for Terra"" animated movie. Everything in this movie is clich√© and seen countless other times. I am not going to give away spoilers for the movie, but once you sit down and watch it, you will go ""hmmm, I have seen this exact storyline and event somewhere else""...Were I to give a rating for the CGI and effects alone, this movie would be a top score, but a movie needs to be more than glamorous effects and fireworks - it needs depth and a solid story. This is where Avatar fell apart.And you just got to love the way Cameron worked in the climate situation propaganda. That was just hilarious! Overall, the movie takes you in for a thrillride of spectacular colors and effects, and provides mediocre entertainment story- and plotwise.I was left with a sense of disappointment from this movie. It could have been so much more than a mediocre thrillride.",neutral
860,"Having seen that Avatar was billed as the most expensive film ever and it was being shown in Cairo where I just happened to be, I thought why not go and give it a try. Too many times this year I have been disappointed with films, surely it could not get any worse.On the contrary, this film turned out to be absolutely amazing.Tremendous action, great graphics, totally absorbing and exciting, splashes of sentiment, romance and even a few chuckles - a masterpiece.... one of the best films of the decade ! I went into the theatre not having a clue what the story was going to be about so I am not going to give readers of this posting any headstart.Except to think of parallels with the demise of the Red Indian tribes and the Amazon Indians.This film is a must !",positive
861,"In typical James Cameron fashion this was an utterly visually stunning masterpiece! Not watching this film in 3D at a cinema would deny the film the justice it deserves. This film, more than any other in history, transforms the audience into a different world.The story itself is solid, although at times predicable. However the central characters remain interesting and engaging. The acting is strong, without being brilliant. However the villain is perhaps overly simplistic and slightly one-dimensional. The story combines drama and action, which is not always a good combination - in this case though, it just works.Overall an absolute MUST SEE! In years to come this film will be reflected upon for its revolutionary special effects and its role in establishing a new era of cinema viewing. Do yourself a favour and absorb yourself in the world of Avatar.",positive
862,"10 Stars doesn't even begin to do this film justice. Saying that this is the singularly most stunning film I have ever seen doesn't do it justice. As I told my wife this movie makes Alien, Titanic, and Terminator look like film school projects.I have seen many many movies and rarely choose to comment. To say anything about the content of this film would only take away from the experience.I will say that not only do you HAVE to see this film, you should really see it in IMAX. I am going to see it again this weekend, and can't wait. I would have sat through it repeatedly, it was that good. There are NO boring moments - and few that aren't simply breathtaking. DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE - and DON'T BUY I SODA - I did and had to miss precious minutes of the film running to the restroom.To summarize:Excellent Direction, Acting, and the finest CGI I have ever seen.",positive
863,"James Cameron takes you on a virtual reality journey in this movie - within a few mins of reaching planet Pandora in the movie, you'll forget you are looking at special effects and get immersed in the world he's created for you. A lot was stressed on the lack of a strong storyline here, but when the special effects are like this, you have no time to ponder about the story. The script and acting are superb - both by the actors and the na'vi characters. But the strength of this experience lies in the world Cameron takes you to - the sights and sounds are realistic beyond compare. This is not your ordinary computer graphics - this is one of the very rare cases where special effects will make it more of a journey than just a movie. It is also a film where 3D really shines. Till now, 3D was the forte of animation movies. Here, 3D will bring you uncannily close to realism...",positive
864,"Avatar has been carved into history as one of the most spectacular cinema achievements ever presented. This record-breaking film brought to us the enchanting beauty of an exotic world and gave us the magic of a Disney classic. Avatar made us dream in a way that very few pictures have ever been able to accomplish. It connected with us as an international community in a unique way, and dominated national media conversation for months surrounding its release. The 2.7 billion dollar box-office pull was the biggest in history and a statistical affirmation of the magnitude which was the 2009 Avatar phenomenon.Keeping in mind these overarching positives, I will do my best to abstain from knocking the film too hard on technicalities. Many reviewers whined that the movie gave us nothing but unoriginality and primitive 3D technology. They claimed that its box-office success was mostly the result of an overly- funded marketing campaign. Although these critiques carry truth, I believe that visually dependent films like Avatar shouldn't necessarily be studied analytically, but rather experienced. That is why we go to the movies right, to feel things? The true charm of the film wasn't in its brilliant screen writing or original concepts, but rather it is was in the wonderful sensations it evoked in us. It is a poor testament to our desensitized culture that many of us cannot enjoy a remarkable piece of art such as Avatar without an objective eye. The script followed the same predictable and cookie-cutter plot lines used in Pocahontas, Dancing With Wolves, as well too many others. None of the characters said anything unexpected or profound and in some instance appeared one-dimension. The cookie-cutter plot gave us the same old mediocre cookie we have now gotten fat off of. You know; white guy protagonist goes to live with the natives for whatever reason, gets accepted into their clan, finds an indigenous girlfriend, then finally fights back against his old white friends. The difference here however is that this cookie was covered in enough icing and drowned in enough sprinkles that it masked the familiar flavors we apparently all hate. Pardon my contradiction to popular hipster opinion, but I would say this recipe always tasted pretty good.It is certainly noteworthy that the underlying left-wing environmental messages were overpowering throughout the entirety of the movie. Seriously though did Al Gore co-write this thing or what? The message was over-simplified to the point where any preteen loser could warm up to it. It made feel like I was sitting through a middle-school science lesson again. Durrr. The negative portrayal of big business was so aggressive and anti-capitalist that it probably gave Bill O'Reilly a hernia. Nothing new for Hollywood though.The acting was good but not brilliant. One of the only stand-out performances in my opinion was by Michelle Rodriguez. Although only casted in a minor role as the tough yet compassionate helicopter pilot named Trudy Chacon, she was a compelling character. She owned the dialogue. Her confident ""don't mess with me"" attitude transitioned to a softer demeanour about half way through when she begins to empathize with the natives. Her subordination from her military duties embodied some of the major themes mentioned above. She eventually burns in a fiery helicopter wreck, but hey at least she fought for what she believed in and died for what was right... Ya ya we get it.Here are my final statements¬Ö Whatever your opinions are related to this film and its enormous box-office success, it can confidently be said that Avatar fulfilled the fundamental purpose of cinema; it entertained us. I will go further and argue that it accomplished this in a timeless and spectacular manner, but of course that is for you to decide. Please do yourselves a favour and re-watch this classic, perhaps without a critical eye this time. We all need to feel like a kid every once in a while so do your best in putting your paganism an hold and enjoy one of the best escapes cinema has ever given us. Escape to Pandora.",neutral
865,"The Major argument for many who boast about how good Avatar is, is the special effects used. I do conform to the wide view that impressive they are, however what I simply cannot do is go on by saying 'they're revolutionary'. They work, so that's a plus, but one cannot help but think in 10 years time we may look back and talk about how ridiculous the effects look, quite simply this facet of the movie represents progress in CGI, but certainly not the beginning of some revolution. Now to the story and setting of the film, its simple enough, effectively a Pocahontas story which I don't imply in a bad way at all, the simple narrative gives you a rather comforting feel for the characters with their views and ambitions clear and not warped and distorted and hidden like many of this type of film go down the path of. For the first 110 minutes I was impressed with what I was seeing, all apart from the ludicrous acting of the films major 'bad guys' and how truly unbelievable those characters were. But Unfortuanately the film spirals into the old clich√© major battle-group initiation-love survives ending, but not before making almost every viewer feel bad for being part of the human race, and getting the urge to rise up and stop capitalism. One has to wonder does James Cameron have any faith in human kind at all?",neutral
866,"James Cameron said that Avatar would change the landscape of cinema forever, and after seeing the film last night, I have to agree. The film looks INCREDIBLE. People have complained about the amount of money James Cameron spent on the film, but it was honestly worth every single cent. Visually, i don't think there is a film superior to it. Not only is the CGI realistic, it's detailed, it's colorful and it looks gorgeous. However, the CGI helps the movie and story propel. The actors are not weighted down and, even in the form of 9 foot tall blue aliens, Worthing and Saldana give terrific performances and a believable romance. There will be those who complain that the story is unoriginal, but I don't think that's what James Cameron is trying to do. He wants us to experience the same types of stories but in a far improved format. There will quibbles about the occasional line of clunky dialogue or clich√©s but these are minor errors. As a whole, the film is a remarkable experience, and make sure you a) see it on the biggest screen you can find and b) see it on 3D because it really does transport you to the new world. As Jake Sully says in the film's teaser, ""this is GREAT.""",positive
867,"""I don't look at scripts. I just write them"" ‚Äì James CameronThe story of this movie is one long drawn out clich√©, which you have felt and seen before: There are good guys and bad guys, a bad guy turns into a good guy, and the new good guy must save all the good guys from the bad guys (simply put). Well, the ""good guys"" (the Na'vi) lives in the forests of the planet Pandora, and are totally one with the nature. Yeah they have their sacred nature places where they pray to their God and they live in a big tree and everything is really holy (oh like the elves in Lord of the Rings??). I hate that 'holy' pseudo crap.. And when they go to war with the ""bad guys"", they paint themselves up in the face (oh like Indians??) Even their language is very similar to the elvish language in Lord of the Rings, at least it sounds very similar. My point is just that the story isn't very original after all. Well of course the bad guys wants to destroy the good guys sacred home, because beneath their big tree they have endless rare resources (yeah because we're all capitalists in the western world, so all we care for is MONEY and we don't give a damn about a sacred nature place) In the lead of this invasion towards the avatars we have this big bad a#¬§ action man stereotype with scars and all that, he even have these great fearless and feeling less clich√© lines like: ""lets get his done, I want to be home for dinner"" etc. BUT besides all the clich√©s and stereotypes there lies a very impressive made movie, with awesome and very enjoyable special-effects. James Cameron is a true master when it comes to making action. In my opinion it's just boring most of the time because I don't really feel for any of the characters, that's all. In other words: The movie is just like most models, beautiful and hot on the outside, but empty within. And like someone else said: 80% will enjoy it to the max and rate this 8-10, while 20% will find it boring and rate it between 1-5.",neutral
868,"James Cameron returns to the director's chair to bring us AVATAR that rises above being just another special effects feast that just sets to show off its big budget and groundbreaking CGI, the difference between AVATAR and many other big budget effects films is that here the effects work in service to the story and showcasing a splendid vision of what Pandora really is, a mystical land of both beauty and danger and lifeforms never seen before.The storyline and performances are beyond reproach and the direction, well its James Cameron the guy brought us ALIENS, TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS, and TITANIC, could it be anything less than great? Overall, its a visual effects feast that is really a feast and must be seen to be truly appreciated.",positive
869,"This is certainly a visually spectacular film. The CGI effects are very good, but much of it still feels like watching a cartoon. CGI has a long way to go to replicate real life.Unfortunately the film lacks a sound plot and fully developed characters. Neither omission is acceptable in such a major film. To have neither makes this feel even more like a cartoon.Worse, there is a plethora of character stereotypes, from the gung ho marine colonel, the military pilot with a conscience, the bureaucrat carrying out the dictates of the evil corporation, to the peaceful ecologically-minded (though blue rather than green!) tree-hugging spiritualist Indians (sorry Na'vi). This collection shows a pretty poor imagination, and a serious lack of originality.Then there are the major plot defects and goofs. The major ones (and they are really major errors) are listed separately.All in all a deeply flawed movie. It may have cost as much as the California budget deficit to make, and the publicity may have been even more expensive than the film, but I doubt its reputation will stand the test of time.",neutral
870,"Sure, the effects ARE excellent- but what a dreadful waste of effects. Surely, at some point, someone must have pointed out to the powers that be that the film contains nothing new. If a film like this wins any awards for anything except special effects it is, surely, an indictment of the low value we put on original (or even interesting) work. The elements of a wonderful story COULD be there but it seems that the special effects budget was more important than the screen writing budget. Dreadfully disappointed with the film and hope that others see it for ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" that it is. Come on Hollywood you can do far better than this!",negative
871,"Okay so I wanna talk for a minute about James Cameron. James Cameron is one of my all time favorite filmmakers ever, he is proven to be a true master at directing films. Look at his body of work and you shall see, it really speaks for itself. Avatar is a masterpiece in many ways to me. There's the amazing special effects and visuals that were so revolutionary back at the time of it's release in 2009. And those visuals really are incredible, seeing Pandora and all it's illustriousness is so enchanting. The effects pull you in, and the talented actors keep you interested in the captivating story. The actors really do a great job here, Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and Michelle Rodriguez all give it their all here. The characters are likable and the film makes you care about them and root for them. The story is kinda predictable i guess, meaning there aren't a whole lot of big twists, but that's ok by me because the film is done in such a magnificent way that it doesn't need anything like that. Bottom line: this is a great story told by talented actors and illustrated with spectacular visual effects. There are also moments of real emotion here, and that's due to the depth in the characters. I 100% recommend Avatar to any and everyone! I'm so excited for these sequels!",positive

873,"A lot of people said that this movies story isn't original and that it is predictable, but I would like to ask them: What story today is? James Cameron did not envision this movie to be some boring, over the top drama, he envisioned it to be a beautiful, inspiring, playful epic adventure, a movie without pathos, a movie with warm, honest, and idealistic characters that believe in a better world. I think that what he intended to do with this movie is to make a compendium of his earlier work, and to give homage to other movies such as The Mission, Star Wars, Jurassic park, and to even some video games like Albion, and I wouldn't call this plagiarism, because these motives are merely borrowed and blended very successfully together to make a very convincing mesh. This movie also tells a subtle ( but sometimes not so subtle :) ) story about people, their dreams and aspirations. This is one of the rare movies I will go to see in a movie theater more than once and I give it an easy 10/10! Way to go Mr Cameron!!!",positive
874,I saw the movie and was instantly captivated by it. I am tempted to go back and see it again. I just wish that there was a book series or a movie novel like what was done with transformers but better and more like the movie. I would recommend this movie as a must see. The movie has a great plot and the acting is some of the best I have seen. The cast was well chosen. The graphics and animation are the best I have seen in years and were perfect. All in all this movie rates in a category all its own of movies that I like. James Cameron is a master when it comes to making movies and Avatar is his best piece of work to date and I commend him on this fine cinemographic piece.,positive

876,"Its one of the Few movies that i watched without checking the trailer, why ? For some reason most of my friends recommended the movie describing it as a one of kind sci-fi movie, so i wondered would it be a new original science fiction plot that could leave you wondering through out the entire movie Like the Matrix or Terminator.Excited to feed my Imagination,i rushed to the movies the following day with great expectations knowing what James Cameron can and will do with such a budget (up the $350M).Not that i was disappointed but i was shocked, the 3-D experience is amazing especially with the mind blowing CGI effects down to the smallest details that were put to make that universe a real one. The Directing, music and the cinematography were outstanding, the actors are better then your average sci-fi heroes but what really ruined it is what should have made it a great movie the Plot.To say the least very predictable and the way they feed the information to the viewers in the first 40 min killed all the mystery of what to expect in a new universe where life exist. beside how predictable this movie was i couldn't help wondering where i have seen this type of heroism plot before ... sadly thats the last thing you could expect from Cameron.Frankly this movie is very entertaining it have the twist and the turns you would expect in an action movie the effects are amazing especially if your planing to watch it in 3-D, some seasoned movie enthusiast might spot the plot fatal errors in information feeding and the duplication from old movies but for those who are just planing to Enjoy an action filled Sci-fi especially for the youngsters it beats most of the movies out there. This is my First Review on IMDb Feedback in rating is appreciated Thanks",positive
877,"I know it's been a long time since the original release but I do not recall this being sooo good. The only reason why I did not give it a 10 is Sam Worthington. He is the least capable actor in this movie. Zoe Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang carry their role very, very well. Anyway, accepting Sam's limitations, the 3D is great, the cinematography is outstanding, the pace is excellent, the character timing is perfectly synced and the soundtrack solid. Given what is coming down the road in 2, I can't help wonder if they ""updated"" this one to better flow into 2, it just seems too perfect of a fit. This is an absolute must-see if you are planning to see 2. Maybe twice.",positive
878,"The film is worth seeing, I'll give you that. I recommend seeing it in 3D but not in IMAX, as I did, as I thought it was not worth the extra cost. My biggest problem with the film was it's writing and pacing, both of which take away from its full impact by taking us out of the lush visual story world that Cameron has created. At it's nearly 3 hour length, the film runs too long, and is overly dependent on visuals for visuals sake. In the writing department, the omnipresent narration by Sam Worthington's character not only does not make sense with in it's own framing device, but drags the film down by over explaining, redundant expository dialog and a condescending inability to allow the actors and the audience to understand the moments by visual and dramatic storytelling rather than let Cameron simply tell us.Even though I found many of the characters archetypal and simplistic, the plot often stretched and full of holes, and the dialog often clichéd and/or lazy; I would give the film an 8/10 instead of a 6/10 if the two aforementioned issues of length and narration were addressed. It could have been even better with some stronger rewriting and honing. I would still say this film is worth seeing in theaters, because all of its value lays in its immersive 3D world which, due to the restraints of home video and theater technology, will simply not translate to home viewing. In the end, Avatar is a visually stunning, well acted tech demo with an excellent film trapped inside, unfortunately defeated due to its director's decidedly singular focus on visual splendor. It is not bad, and you will probably enjoy it far more than I did, but I personally am disappointed, because it could have been exceptional if the team behind it put half the effort in to the story that they put into the setting.",neutral
879,"With so many objective and intelligent reviews, some may have impressed millions of readers and some maybe buried from tons of commentaries and never had any chance being read. But i rather have my feelings written rather than never tried to be heard at all.James Cameron did it again! Since his Titanic that smashed a lot of movies in the row that left people shading tears, breathless and made his masterpiece a history to mankind, he comes out again with something more spectacular and never seen in big screens. Avatar is truly a cinematic experience i would never forget.No word to describe the movie as whole but it is certainly a piece of art and a real entertainment. The story is predictable, you can tell what will happen in the end, but what makes it a good film is that the elements to make a story perfect is to add some ingredients which James Cameron didn't fail to put in to. Visual Effects make a humongous contribution for the movie that is undeniably unconventional kind of imagination. Pandora is a perfect fantasy, an escape in which every human desire and aspire for in their deepest subconscious minds glittered with painful reality in this world we live in. Imagine when you are in pain and there is no other alternative cure for it but to tolerate it, then, the only way to alleviate the pain is by thinking something good to at least in a second of your life you will forget everything. That is Avatar! Cameron's imagination is superb and with depth of artistic touch that captures human weakness. Drama is obviously what most people want to see in a story- something that create an unforgettable impression in the heart of every audience who leave the theater. Titanic has touched millions of people around the world that never vanished in the memory like any other movies. Same through with Avatar- it will surely last forever.The Na'vi are those who believe that everyone has a connection- that if they permit themselves to engage to it will create unity and peace among them guided by a god they call 'Eywa'. There are people like the Na'vi who still exist today- those who protects nature and their culture but are being sabotaged, abused and invaded by outsiders who don't belong with them- leads to destruction and extinction of natural beauty.The irony: So many people invade other private lives in the most friendly way, become a friend then later leaves devastation of innocent people. Look at what is going on in Iraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the world. Who are the Na'vi? Who are the ""Intruders""? Thank you.",positive
880,"I got caught by the 'avatar wave' a couple of days ago and subsequently went to see this movie. Leaving the cinema i was left with a very double feeling.The technics behind this movie, the design all without a doubt find themselves on epically lonely heights... The quality and creativeness of the plot on the other hand lags behind by about 27 miles. One could almost see the truly majestic CGI cry about the insultingly dismal series of events it had to play scenery for. How mister Cameron could spend all these years on this movie and in the end deliver this kind of feeble plot line is totally beyond me. Why would he do that?Technology/design/CGI : 5/5 Story/plot : 2/5",positive

The script for ""Avatar"" was lying on the shelves for many years, many were waiting for this movie. Of course, all the sublime expectation, ""It's Cameron."" I did not like the movie. In the first due to the fact that they call it the best film of the 21st century, why he is the best? It was in fact a lot of other, more interesting movies. Secondly, it is absolutely stupid plot, the lack of game actors. This is not a movie, and one large computer. If anyone should be praised and so it is not Cameron, and artists. This film does not deserve such a large box office receipts, it is simply empty.",negative
882,"A very well rounded movie, great characters. Good beginning, good middle, great ending also. This movie appeals to the Visual with sparkles, crystal twirlies and colorful creatures, also to the Kinesthetics with feel good relationships. All throughout he movie characters are building friendships, trust and bonding. The sounds are very creative from the animal sounds to the ratatatat of the weapons in some of the fight scenes. Avatar is a little violent at times but for the most part it is beautifully made and believable. I never really like cgi before but the creators of the movie really spent a lot of time making believable figures and wonderfully overactive forest life, creatures and energetic dragonlike creatures. This movie is well worth watching.",positive
883,"After seeing this movie for the first time (4:10pm) I felt like I had just logged out from the best video game (FPSMMORPG to be specific) I'd ever played in my life and that I was going through withdrawals by not having the 3-D film in front of me for my viewing pleasure. This led me back to the theater once again with another $15 in hand to see the 10:35 showing. In 3-D they managed to do a ridiculously amazing job at making you feel like you're actually IN every scene rather than just having things fly in front of you like back in the Captain EO days at Disneyland. I hope this new, or at least new to me,'first person' 3-D animation style brings a whole new style of filming/film-making. Along with the latest CG the artist did made me feel as if this was the first movie that flawlessly combined computer animation with real life actors without it making it look cheesy or cartoony like in the Matrix 2/3, Star Wars, or even LOTR at times. From the plot, to the animation, to the love story and action packed adventure, to the acting, to the jokes, to the casting, I loved every bit of it. 10/10 from me.",positive
884,"For a few months I put off watching Avatar because I felt that the trailer simply didn't grab my attention. From my notion of not judging a book by its cover just because the director is a celebrated writer, I shrugged this film off believing the general idea of the film to be either altogether ludicrous or heroically ambitious. After reading numerous reviews, hearing how good it was by word of mouth, and then learning it was fairly high up on the IMDb top 250, I decided to finally watch it. To put it bluntly I was blown away.I've watched this movie twice. The first time I watched it, I found the first 20-30 minutes to be fairly mediocre, with merely satisfactory character and plot development, however finding that the rest of the movie escalated into a very captivating and enjoyable experience. At the end of the first sitting I thought it was pretty good, but had one or two areas for improvement. After watching it a second time I was largely surprised to find that it simply blew me away as I enjoyed it from the opening sequence, whether this was due to my prior knowledge of what was to come, or simply paying more attention.The depth of the story is phenomenal, and really kicks into high gear when you start to learn more about the native humanoid clans known as the ""Na'vi"". Pandora, the world that James Cameron has created is incredibly detailed from the large landscapes to the small wildlife as you explore it through the eyes of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-Marine who came to Pandora following his genetically-identical twin brother's death. As the story progresses his performance gets better and better. Possibly the best display of acting comes from Zoe Saldana, portraying Neytiri, the Na'vi princess of the Omaticaya Clan who brings an electrifying personality to the story. As Jake is taught the way of the Na'vi people by Neytiri, they begin to fall in love in a groundbreaking and emotionally engaging experience as eventually they must fight to protect Pandora from the increasingly destructive and seemingly evil Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who does an excellent job in turning the audience as he becomes ever-more brutal towards the natives. Sigourney Weaver and Joel Moore also pull off their roles as Pandora scientists with perfection in their quest to learn more about the Na'vi as well as eventually helping Jake fight Colonel Quaritch.The special effects of Avatar, though clearly an unrivalled benchmark in the film industry, have been criticised by other reviewers who believe the film wouldn't be nearly as good were it not for the CGI. My opinion is quite the reverse. Though others may see the special effects as a 'distraction' from a poorly written story derived from other films, I believe the effects are precisely what make the story so effective. I strongly disagree with the notion that Avatar is like Dances With Wolves in some fancy clothes. I think the CGI, though brilliant in itself, is what draws you into this epic adventure as you really connect with the characters and cannot help but get wrapped up in the building tension between the Na'vi and human forces.On a final note, I think Writer/Director James Cameron hit the nail on the head when he created Avatar, which definitely deserves a spot in the top 100. One of those rare must-see films. 9.7/10",positive
885,"The best movie in a long time and it must be seen by everyone to experience the wonder that is this movie.I recommend you all see this movie in 3D since the effects and the decors and the characters are so extraordinary that you remain amazed by the beauty of it all. The story is great and the effects are great. It is a movie that the hole family can watch and the money for the ticket are well forth it because we want them to keep on making these kind of movies and go all in, without being afraid of not earning enough to make it worth it. I think James Cameron is a genius and he should make these kind of movies more often.The characters and the athleticism that they show, the fighting scenes and all the plants and animals that make that world are just wonderful to watch.I loved the movie and recommend it to all as something everyone must see.",positive
886,"Now that the movie has been around for a while and the hype died down it may be time to take a closer look at some of the more worrying aspects of the Avatar plot. In effect is Avatar a pro Taliban movie? Does Avatar advocate treachery against ones own friends and military commanders in a time of war in support of an enemy monolithic religious regime? Does Avatar promote killing in the name of a blind indoctrinated religious faith over individuality and natural human rights? Jake Sully is a disabled ex marine sent undercover as an Avatar to live among the native Na'Vi indigenous beings of the planet Pandora. He is sent in as a spy to become a local. He ends up not only becoming a local by joining in their rituals, succumbing to a honey trap and choosing a local as his mate but also trains the locals how to fight and kill his own comrades.He actively lures his former commander into a trap and kills him. In anyones book (except James Cameron's) Jake Sully is a traitor. Yet he is presented throughout the movie as a hero. At no point does any of his friends challenge him about his decisions to ""go native"" - only his military commander can see the danger he is in and warns him about the consequences. Which Sully ignores and continues on his self indulgent mission of human destruction by dragging his friends into the quasi religious cult he is building.The Na'Vi clearly live a pre-civilisation lifestyle of hunter gathering rather than established farming. Their entire social being appears to be indoctrinated by a belief in an hierarchical structure that puts the priests at the top of the pile. They unquestioningly chant and wave their arms around during bizarre faith-healing ceremonies that have no basis other than intending to succumb the mass to the power of the few. The Na'Vi are clearly violent, have no belief in merit other than as hunters or warriors, at no point is intellect virtued. They claim to want to find out about the ""Dreamwalkers"" (Earthling avatars) but when they have one in their midst they show no interest in discovering the virtues of human existence. They do not question why the humans want their ""unobtainium"" nor do they see any virtue in such human traits as democracy or equality. They do not even ask about human beliefs or gods. They are, in effect, very ignorant and incredibly arrogant. The Na'Vi live in a patriarchal society where males choose their mates based seemingly upon their hunting prowess or ability to sing. There is no sense given anywhere in the film that Na'Vi in anyway care about multifaceted emotions. But the most heinous (war?) crime committed by the traitor Sully is to proudly be seen at the end of the movie taking his ex comrades prisoner at gunpoint and returning them to what he acknowledges is a dying planet (Earth?). He sends his prisoners of war to almost certain death. The only humans allowed to stay in his dictatorial utopia worshipping the trees and believing in the dead still somehow being alive are those among his comrades that he has managed to radicalise into his own beliefs and who now so willingly carry weapons and threaten their former colleagues, including the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver.If a former US Marine is found to have converted to Islam and fights on the side of the Taliban does he now have justification in saying ""I was just following the example set by James Cameron""?Let's see if Cameron has the guts to set the record straight in Avatar 2",neutral
887,"Avatar was next film I was excited to watch this year after Harry Potter and half blood prince. I finally saw it yesterday in 3D though Not IMAX 3D (all IMAX shows were full). What I Like in Movie1. Visuals: Great Movie! One of the finest piece of art ever shown in cinematic World. From start to end Movie visuals were superb. The planet Pandora and its creatures shown in the movie were visually stunning. 2. Acting: after Visuals, something I loved about this movie was acting. James Cameroon knows how to bring out best from his actors. Avatar depended lot on acting. I know every movie depends on Acting but for. Avatar to be successful (Quality wise) Good acting was necessity. If Acting would have been anything less than great, I dare to say but Movie would have been very boring for me. But luckily Acting was great and save the day for James CameroonWhat I Didn't Like in Movie 1. Story/screenplay: Story is weakest link of the movie. There was nothing new to watch in the movie. All plots and Scene were repeated or shown before in other movies. Whether it is big creature chasing Jake sully (Sam Worthington) or Action in the end, mostly every scene and plot was expected. It's like I know this is going to happen or this scene will end in the way. 2. Not many Exciting moments: I said earlier everything in the movie was expected. So, even with superb visuals movie didn't had many exciting moments. 3. Long movie: 162 minutes with poor screenplay is very tough to watch. I would say 130-135 minutes would have given life to movie. First half was boring except few scenes.4. High Expectation: If you don't get Christmas gift you wanted most, then you are left with disappointment. The same thing happens with me here. I went with high expectations but was left with Disappointment. It was short of my expectations. It is possible that my Rating was affected by it.5. Music: Music was somehow disappointing for me. Some were good and perfect for movie but most of them were disappointingOverall Rating: 7.5/10 Watch this movie! Go simply for visuals. You will Love movie",positive
888,"Thank you James Cameron and all the people who made this incredible movie: a visionary prayer for the human species.The concept and execution are flawless. The acting is top notch. The special effects are nothing less than astonishing and groundbreaking. The running time is long, but every minute was worthwhile and I never got bored.We are both the Sky People and the Na'vi. It is our destiny to realize that our hearts are connected in and through our mother, the earth. Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a former marine who was wounded and paralyzed in war. Jake is selected to participate in the Avatar Program, which will enable him to walk. The program consists of mixing Human DNA with the DNA of the native Na'vi, to form an Avatar. Jake travels to Pandora, a moon near the size of earth, on a large spaceship. In his Avatar body, Jake meets Neytiri, the Na'vi princess of the Omaticaya's Clan. The RDA finances the Avatar program but their main purpose is to to obtain Unobtainium, a rare mineral that can solve the humans' energy crisis and that is worth $20 million a kilogram back on earth. The Avatars are meant to negotiate the Na'vi to relocate from a huge Unobtainium deposit. When the RDA start to destroy Pandora to get the mineral, Jake endeavors to help Neytiri and the rest of the Na'vi to stop the RDA and their private army.",positive
889,"""Gee, I wonder what's going to happen next?"" is an expression I rarely find myself thinking with most films nowadays. I knew going into this film that I was going for a VISUAL spectacle, not a compelling story.I was visually stunned and overwhelmed by the beautiful design of the world of Pandora. The phospholuminescent wildlife created by the special effects team felt real and in its place, it felt believable. Serious thought and care was given to the interactions of the wildlife on the planet; the way different animals behaved and looked was believable.I also enjoyed the technique used to meld the faces of the actors(Sigourney Weaver in particular) with the fictitious Na'vi. However, I found myself thinking that the special effects were SO good...why didn't they just make the whole film in CG? The Na'vi looked real enough, surely they could do humans that looked just as good.Mr. Cameron loses points for the unoriginal story. Because this tale has been told before in(you guessed it) Dances with Wolves, Ferngully, and Disney's Pocahontas, I was never on the edge of my seat or surprised about anything in the film. When a film or other form of story is THAT predictable, that's bad. If Mr. Cameron was upfront about the true origin of ""his"" story, such as putting ""Based on the novel ""Dances with Wolves"" written by Michael Blake"" near the beginning of the credits, I would be a bit more forgiving.James Horner's score felt appropriate most of the time, especially when the children's choir kicked into high gear. There was one point in the film though where Horner re-uses a theme and chord right out of his ""Troy"" score, and I got displaced for a moment.All in all, I ENJOYED the film(which is the whole point, right?) but I was not IMPRESSED with it. The story or plot is the main driving force behind a good film; coupled with good acting. And story-wise this film did not disappoint or impress, it was just simply unoriginal and predictable on the count of being unoriginal.7/10 for IMDb, 3/5 for Academy Star Score.Even though ""District 9"" is not as family friendly as this film is, it is still the #1 SciFi film of 2009, followed by ""Star Trek"". Yes, I said that. At least ""Star Trek"" kept me wanting more, rather than just waiting to leave the theater.Those of you who give it a ""10"" just because you like it, or give it a ""1"" just because you hate it really need to think and plan out a critique, rather than just dishing out a ""perfect"" or a ""horrible"" at a whim.",positive
890,"Well, after months of waiting ,i finally got to see Avatar, a film all about going native... with a vengeance. My worst fears, from the trailer: hackneyed dialogue, didn't materialise, and tho the script was excellent, it was the actors who brought it and Pandora to life. Subtle, tender, sweet, brutal, menacing:cameron doesn't do things by halves. The tenderness of the two leads is as convincing as the initial menace of the na'vi and the growing menace of the humans. Worthington and Saldana are splendid as the two leads...Worthinton making his slow and painful transition from human to navi credible by digging into his character and finding the heart. The direction, script and running time allow space for this transformation... NO: Its not necessary to have a completely new idea...but it is important to make it come alive. In this Cameron and his crew have succeeded...much of this is due to the SFX teams and the actors. Saldana may have been as much of a chance for Cameron as Worthinton(who made me think of Russell Crowe), being little known, and having #150,000,000 riding on her slender form but she gives life and passion to elven Neytiri: as the princess, teacher friend and lover to the initially wild Jake: going from a wish to kill, contempt slowly shedding these as she recognises Jakes worth(pun!) and teaches him the ways of her people. The spine of the film is his transformation, which is one of the highlights. Lang as Qaritch, is also terrific as the brutal Qaritch, with his single vision, and dark alter-teacher to Jake...Marked like Ahab, has only made his character the more ominous..he's like a bomb waiting to go off. Sigoruney Weaver is terrific as the tough principled scientist, who stands up to the corporate mercenaries. I liked the idea where jakes 'emptiness' was used to his advantage over the scientists in bridging the gulf between human and Navi. Interesting irony, this scene echoes the tea pouring scene in that other fabulous epic: 2012. Notable feature of the film is nits use of parallels: esp the robot transports who counterparts to the Avatars: the mechanical/scientific vs the natural/mystical embody the confrontation we see in our world. Ironical. The world itself is loving rendered: almost it looks as if cameron has been to pandora and filmed live. But we can see where much of the money went! From the great trees, to the luminous seedpods, flying beasts and snarling dog things, floating mountains and calling waterfalls the world is rendered in marvelous detail. Beautiful and dangerous. Avatar is the furthest anyone has gone in rendering alien worlds in mainstream life action films...only European animation (Fantastic Planet) has gone further. And tho the people are blue, there's not a smurf in sight...",positive
891,"Usually it happens, with films that introduce some technical innovation, that the fascination only lasts for as long as the next technical innovation appears. In Avatar, it doesn't even last that long. Once your eyes get used to the crispy images and colours, you realize that this is really only a cartoon on high-definition.So on to the film. This is pretty much the Conquistadores versus the American-natives allover again.So on to whatever ideas are to be found here.I am willing to indulge the whole philosophy that nature acts as some sort of network and that we should interact harmoniously with it. It's just that the whole idea is leaking in the sense that in a nature that works in a Darwinian framework, it doesn't make much difference if the hunter respects the prey, or if a species is becoming extinct due to extraneous factors. Nature is chaos and you can find all sorts of excuses to justify chaos, or learn to live with it. But it's still chaos, and chaos has no sentiment.The last part of the film is ""Rambo"" and ""Aliens"" allover again, and to be honest, no matter how advanced the computer graphics are, this is less impressive than Cameron's past adventures.",positive
892,"As the pandering Frankenstein that is the new Star Wars ""movie"" steamrolls its way toward dethroning Avatar's (inexplicable) preeminence, I thought I'd finally get around to copping a squat on this most mind-bogglingly absurd success story.As with The Force Awakens, people just couldn't hand over their money fast enough, and as with The Force Awakens, I have absolutely no idea why. Because I'll just never be on board with the one & only ""argument"" for this movie: ""the effects are really great and it looks like a lifelike world to escape into"". Or some variation of such.But notice that *serious* components of story-telling don't get mentioned... stuff like story lines, acting... you know, crap like that. Instead, it would seem that this movie reached $2.7 billion because it's ""pretty"".Okay, so it looks nice... right?Nope. In fact, I was so overwhelmingly disappointed with ALL of the effects that I just could not reconcile myself with the fact that people became so obsessed with ""Pandora"" that many of them were seriously depressed when the movie ended. The blue people themselves were unusually inexcusable in this regard. What the hell were the masses smoking before going into theaters around the world?This, incidentally, is one of those ""life lesson"" moments, especially for the 21st century: if you're so disconnected from the real world that you need shallow entertainment to break free of your own self-imposed mental prison, then...GO OUTSIDE. Seriously.There's a whole world out there! Sights! Sounds! Living things! Or just switch over to PBS once in a while. You'll see critters that don't look stupid! There really is life beyond James Cameron's (allegedly) plagiarized movie, folks.And to address an amusingly secondary factor of the film-making process: the actual storyline. I remember back in ""the old days"" when I would hear about Director's Cuts, and how superior they must have been to the versions of movies that got past the studios, focus groups, etc. But boy, did this movie change that.Avatar is a prime example of what happens when no one says NO. This whole thing just felt like a rough draft. From repeated lines to extraneous dialogue, it felt like a significant rush job (not least because the effects were so surprisingly weak as well).One glaring example that stood out for me: the assessment of the dangers the military would be facing. Early in the movie, it was described as ""worse than hell out there"", and yet it's also shown that the worst the blue people could do was fire arrows into tires so massive that they didn't even have an impact.And sure enough, the later onslaught was met with such flimsy resistance that The Bad Guy was calmly sipping coffee in a flying vehicle during a major firefight. ""Worse than hell""? Why, because he risked his coffee cooling to room temperature?I don't get it. I never will. The only high point of the movie, as far as I'm concerned, was Michelle Rodriguez's low neckline. I'll never get sick of seeing that woman with a gun.But do a few shots of cleavage make up for two and a half hours of smurf puke? That, friends, is what we call a rhetorical question. Look it up.",negative

894,"Without a doubt, Avatar is one of the best movies that has ever made because not only its revolutionary technique, incredible effects, stunning visual, James Cameron's unlimited imaginary, but also incisive messages that it brings.In Pandora, you can see how wonderful the nature is as well as the relationship between nature and its citizens. But human who think they are the smartest one allow themselves to have the right to invade and destroy any one or anything to appropriate the very valuable thing under the ground of Pandora. I can't expect that how such cruel the human is. People are damaging the nature in their planet because of restricted greedy and they will always ready slaughter even an peaceful planet and beautiful civilization that can bring them money. How can human treat that way? With Avatar, I was stunning not because of 3D effect but ""I see you"" of Neytiri. Quaritch may never understand why Jake Sully betrayed his race to protect Pandora against those who want to kill the nature because of power and money. These greedy people can never know the connection between nature and human. They never feel hurt when the forests are burned. They never have tears when sap are out of from collapsed trees. But witnessing these scene, Jake Sully and other scientists feel deep grief because every single of them has a kindness heart. Jake has made Neytiri ""see"" his heart, made Navi believe him, and been approved of nature.After watching Avatar, have you ever put your hand on your chest to ""see"" yourself and others? Have we ever wonder ourselves what we have done for our planet and the nature that we are living in?",positive
895,"Do you remember the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? The day you watched Gollum interacting with Frodo and Sam in The Two Towers? Or even the day you first saw Star Wars? That sense of wonder, that sense of excitement, that emotional connection to something you witness on screen that was created in an effects warehouse and does not exist in the real world. That is how I hoped I would feel when I watched Avatar, James Cameron's first film since his mighty Titanic set sail back in 1997.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic marine sent to the distant planet Pandora to take part in a program where humans are being hardwired into the genetically grown bodies of the native population called the Na'vi. The mission is to become part of a clan, and learn more about the Na'vi people's culture. But not everything always goes to plan.Simply put, Avatar is an astonishing piece of film-making in all senses of the word. I had doubts that Cameron could top himself after breaking huge ground in the film-making medium with the likes of Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic, but those twelve years of documentary film-making and preparation (and maybe even helping create Aquaman) seems to have helped launch Avatar into the stratosphere. The film is difficult to describe, but it really is something to be marvelled at.The special effects that drive Avatar are some of the most advanced we have ever seen in a film. WETA has created a living, breathing world filled with a plethora of highly imaginative creatures, weapons and vehicles. Even the most sinister of beasts looks richly detailed, and awe-inspiring. There is just too much work that has been done on these creations that it is painful to even fathom how many hours it took to design everything that populates Pandora. Even the set designs and backgrounds, whether it be in the wild nature of the planet or in the militarized bases smack in the middle of it, are fully realized creations. There is no stone left unturned here, no half-assed effects in certain areas (which is more than can be said for the disgustingly effects-heavy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen); everything has the same amount of shine and polish added to it. The added gloss of 3D effects only help to further bring these effects to life, and seeing the film in a 2D setting would just be a disservice to the crew who put in all the effort to create them.When we reflect years from now on the film, the Na'vi people themselves are undoubtedly what we will continue to discuss. These giant, slim, blue skinned humanoid creatures are sensational creations. I wanted to believe at any given moment that they were real, because they looked and sounded that good. Better yet, Cameron managed to ensure they had their own language and their own culture as well. If they were not real, then the man has gone to great lengths to ensure they are the next best thing to it. There is so much going on at any time with them that I am speechless even attempting to decipher what to say next. If the film does not revolutionize film-making as people have said it in the months leading up to its release, these special effects wonders will.The acting is extraordinary across the board, whether it be someone acting as a human or as a Na'vi. Worthington continues from his film-stealing role in Terminator Salvation with another fantastic performance here. He is just so charismatic, so emotional and so real that even with his relative inexperience, he leads the film like no one else could. Zoe Saldana does a great job as Neytiri, Jake's connection within the Na'vi people, as does Michelle Rodriguez as the fighter pilot Trudy. Joel David Moore and Giovanni Ribisi also put in some great work in supporting roles. Although I was not expecting much from her, I was really impressed by Sigourney Weaver, who has a much more significant role in the film than the trailer may suggest. But the only one who even remotely comes close to the greatness of Worthington is Stephen Lang as the villainous Colonel Miles Quaritch. He gladly joins into a club of fantastically written and even better acted bad ass Cameron-film villains. At times, he is just downright terrifying to watch as he works his magic on screen.If there is anything wrong with the film besides its nearly obscene running time (which is not as bad as it could have been), it is that it plays out slightly predictable. It is not as by-the-numbers as movies like Clint Eastwood's Invictus is, but it does not take a lot of sharp turns after the plot makes itself known. If you know anything about it at all, you probably have a fair idea of what is coming once the film starts. I appreciate that the film does have a few surprises (and its share of hokey dialogue), but there were a few areas where I wish I did not already have a solid right guess as to what was coming next.Despite issues with the script, Avatar still manages to be the single most ambitiously conceived film-making project of the decade, and the rare film that is every bit worthy of its hype. It is the type of film where you need to look past its issues, and look at the worthwhile endeavour Cameron has helped give us for what it is – a truly unique science fiction that is unlike what we have ever seen before, and will not be easily recreated. The film practically begs to be seen to be believed.Welcome back Mr. Cameron. Hail to the king.8.5/10.",positive
896,"Stunning effects yes, equally stunning in-your-face anti-humanity plot—probably evaded by most visually blitzed viewers. Lets consider Cameron as having a unique position in the totally risk-adverse, less than inspiring industry. He can break formula for a truly memorable impact in movie-making history. The opportunity was there, the time / money and the talent too, but the magic? Not sure that illusive quality of touching the human spirit was there. Perhaps because the moral of the story for the mostly human audience is that we, as a species, destroy everything and if we are the chosen one, we get to destroy humans and be blessed with alien-hood. I see the master movie-maker backtracked a bit calling it an environmental / ecological message—in essence a ""reverse-psychology"" plot. ""Lets go to another world and see what not to do to our own one,"" so the thinking goes? Or maybe the guy just hates humans, facing the scrutiny of the public with the most commercially successful films, maybe that will do it to you. Theories aside, its an organic Matrix story. Instead of a fake computer world, its an alien one on another planet, instead of superman bodies that can stop bullets, its large blue aliens that are strangely similar to Native Americans. Instead of the Oracle, its a giant tree, the chosen one and so on...perhaps the Wachowski bros should be added to the writing credits. Throw in some ""Aliens"" material with the bad-ass space marines, how about some ""King Kong"" T-rex scene inspired footage . But, then again, its just entertainment isn't it? Yes, which is why its probably forgotten after the industry cycles out a few more visual epics along the same budget lines. Maybe the flaw is expecting an inspiring ""Star Wars"" type human struggle story. James, I'm still disappointed that what materialized is an old kid playing war games with big cool machines. But then again, these are convoluted times and maybe it fits the bill.",neutral
897,"Here we are in 2009. It has been 12 years since Cameron last gave us one of his blockbusters in Titanic. With Avatar he set out to change the way we watch movies with his new motion capture technology all in 3D. Did he succeed? Sort of. While no one can deny the visual masterpiece this film is, there are some major problems that hinder Avatar from being one of the greatest movies of our time. The big problem I had with this movie was the story itself. It was redundant, one dimensional and well, boring. There were times throughout the film that I was compelled and on the edge of my seat, but for a 2.5 hrs + film, you need to feel that way 90% of the time. I am not naive, I knew going into a James Cameron film the story and especially the script wasn't going to rivet me out of my chair, but I at least expected to be entertained by it. I wasn't. The commentaries Cameron seems to do on anti-war and environmentalism just did not resonate with me. The dialogue in parts had my eyes in a constant roll.With that being said however, whenever the story was boring me to tears, I could just sit and look what was going on around the story. There was always something to look it, always something to fascinate me. Sigourney Weaver turned in a very decent performance and was the only actor in places to be able to rise above the dialogue Cameron gave them. However, there were times even she could not do it. Sam Worthington I feel was miscast, but he fits Cameron's niche for male leads, a la Arnold. I do believe this film will be showered with technical awards for its revolutionary technology and will get a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars in March. But, we must all remember that if you take away the visuals of this film, it is nothing more than a camp-fest that would go straight to DVD. With most of Cameron's previous movies they were much more layered beyond the visuals and special effects. I feel he got too caught up in wowing our eyes and completely forgot about what's behind them.6.5/10.**1/2 out of ****",neutral
898,"This is a movie like no other in the realm of visual experiences. The CGI segments rang true and rarely did the realization they were not real encroach.This is simply not a film to be missed. It is groundbreaking in its technological achievements and also entertaining enough to carry it all along.The not so good: The story was a bit heavy handed. I could not agree more with the message but I think the way it is delivered is not so useful.The flow was a bit rushed or even choppy in some spots as though scenes had been deleted or shortened. Perhaps a director's cut will fix that.I eagerly await a non-3D version as I thought the glasses and effects detracted from, rather than enhanced the experience. Perhaps I will feel differently if I see a 2D version.The visuals sometimes reminded me of those black-light posters from the '70s. The neon-color thing just got pushed over the top in a couple of scenes.In a few scenes, the clarity and reality of the CGI really rose above the rest of the movie and it made me notice that in many others scenes they were a bit muddied in comparison.This is no Star Wars - I saw Star Wars when it came out and this simply does not have the story power it had. The improvement in visual technology is not as great or profound either - this film is a big leap, just not of the magnitude of the first Star Wars.The human characters, especially in their non-CGI persona were a bit flat in my opinion and/or rehashes from the standard Hollywood character bin.This is a great film and deserves to be seen but it is just not the be-all, end-all of modern cinema some are making it out to be.",positive
899,"Mr. Cameron...what can I say? You've done it again!James Cameron creates the world of Pandora, inhabited by the humanoid creatures known as ""the Na'vi"", and several other creatures made by some of the greatest special effects the world has ever seen - something only James Cameron could do.To clear up some confusion first: most people are asking ""What's the avatar"" and ""how does he become it"". The avatar that Jake has is a genetic replication of one of the Na'vi that is mixed with human DNA to look like him (actually his twin brother...long story, see the movie). Once he is linked for the first time, he becomes one with his avatar. He is put into a machine, ad he is linked to his Avatar, wherever it may be. Whenever Jake (as the avatar) falls asleep, he wakes up as Jake (as a human). He is then eventually sent back by being put into the machine. Now, the movie is over 2 hours. I will admit, the first hour or so is a little slow, but it is definitely enough to keep your interest. Once the jailbreak scene occurs, be prepared for seeing one of the greatest movies of all time. The second part more than makes up for the somewhat slow start to what turned out to be an amazing motion picture I know I will watch again and again. Thanks to James Cameron for this amazing film experience.(PS...See it in 3-D if you can.)10/10 - Go see it...now! Don't just sit there...go now!",positive
900,"Now, before I go into details, I should tell you that it is worth watching and an enjoyable film with all the visual effects and the all the usual huha of a totally commercial one. Also what I like about it is the basic message of the movie and the shamanic influence. That was what was great about the film.All that said, why is everything on that planet Glow-in-the-dark? C'mon guys, Glow-in- the-dark?? If that wasn't annoying/desperate-to-get-your-attention enough, the wild animals in the movie were all so clichéd and predictable just like the next scene. Apparently on that planet (called Pandora) the survival-of-the-fittest rule has been rubbished long ago and all that is need by life on that planet is decided by their ornamentation, exoticness and the ability-to-blow-your-mind-ness. Why is every beast on that planet a freak version of one of ours? Horses (or the huge birds, i don't remember) had 4 eyes..what for? I mean 2 eyes on one side right next to each other serve what purpose? They still hunt down and eat an animal that looks just like a deer..why not something else? One might be glad their blood is still red (so it stirs up that usual emotion when you see it) and not fluorescent green. So is this lack of imagination/originality? Or trying too hard to get the kids' attention? I'm just glad it didn't have a hip-hop score.And then, Giovanni Ribisi was bad suited for whatever role he was there for. He couldn't play it convincingly.All the lines were too corny...too American. And that reminds me. There are only Americans for humans. They could do it alone - Find and go to an exotic new planet and start a monopoly.Finally, have I said it already that almost every scene was very predictable. The female had to come save him from the wild dog-like things in the beginning, had to be the daughter of the head of their clan, and her brother had to hate this guy almost the instant he sees him etc...countless..None of the characters made me feel for them either. Maybe I've become a stoneheart. :PSo, best movie of the year?? In my opinion, NO. Inglourious Basterds maybe. That was good. This movie is a fresh new Jurassic Park. Thats what it is.In short, James Cameron thought ""I'm payin' so much for the visual effects...that should take care of anything else."" Do watch it, and like it. But don't hype it.",positive
901,"PREAMBLE: This review has been deleted. It was done so based on another user suggestion. I'm not sure why, so I deleted some dirty words that might offend some ""users"". I'm reposting it now with slight changes and some notes in brackets {}.I'm not going to try call the art 'where are thee?' because Avatar isn't trying pretend to be deep anyway. However I'm very concerned about the amount of the 10/10 reviews here at IMDb. It probably shows something. People don't think anymore, they want candy. So they got it. But you can't feed on candy only, you know. At the time when I'm writing this review, Avatar sits on the 24th position of the TOP250, between 25th Silence of the Lambs and 23th Once Upon a Time in the West.OK, so what's wrong? Story - Main character, Jake, infiltrates a tribe of aliens on some planet. This tribe resides on the source of some highly expensive mineral. The tribe must be wiped out because of it. Jake starts to like his new friends, because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature. He also fell in love with female alien, Nscho-tschi, er... Neytiri. Battle between humans and aliens. The end. -- Well, not only has been this around thousand times over and over again, but it (go figure!) might have taken some bits from the history as well. Dances with Wolves have been mentioned in some reviews and I can think of even more accurate example - Enemy Mine (1985). Wiping the native Americans was a damn shame from any angle, but please, we all have got the point that it was wrong, OK? Get over it and don't breed the hate among the... {offensive words removed}. If you need some movie history lesson from this area, go see the Little Big Man (1970), the plot is exactly the same, only you won't need the 3D goggles.Script - None. The pattern could have been written by anybody, who has seen the standard action flicks. First few minutes, we get the direct explanation about what, where, who and why. And you know this type of explanation, right? Actors talking to each other and explaining the situation, like they never met before. The lecture from Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) given to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, why?) in their first dialog raised my palm to my face. The intellect of the audience has been lowered down again. Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too. The aliens win the final battle and the lead character becomes one of them. Duh.Actors and setting - Who the hell need actors when we've got CGI? I was in the theater with my brother, who plays computer games a lot. After we came out of the building, he named me several things, which have been taken out straight from several PC games, like Command and Conquer, Heroes of Might and Magic, Warcraft and so on. So another rip-off.Visual effects - You've got this right. But wait another 20 years. It's like silicon breast. Now it looks good on your 20 years old body, but wait another 20. I still can't believe the score on IMDb is based solely on visual effects. It's so wrong! I have a theory about the whole thing. I think Cameron has been paid a fortune to do this. Why? Let's say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don't go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right? So the industry needs a new type of movies. Movies with lame story, lame script, lame everything, but top CGI, 3D, IMAX, ultra-mega-realistic screening, so the movie downloaded from the internet is, in fact, useless. I've got nothing against this strategy. I don't give a damn about these mindless flicks, but they just don't belong among the TOP250, that's why I went to see Avatar. Out of curiosity. And my jaw did drop. From a shame where the intellect of the majority is going. I'm also ashamed that I went there and paid the money to see it. It's utterly trash. {section with ""dirty"" movies has been removed}0/10.",negative
902,"Just Watched The long awaited James Cameron's AVATAR. And I must say It was worth a wait. Though James Cameron Subjects Only Aliens or Titanic, But he portrays them Beautifully and Professionally. Titanic, which created History was considered his finest work but I must Disagree. All of his work can't be compared and Equally good. And A lot of you guys will agree with me that Titanic is way Under-rated.Well lets forget Titanic now, Come to Avatar.Its Just a well made, Visually stunning movie which is perfect in most respects.The Best Part of the movie is The Visuals, Graphics and Cinematography. No other Film could reach this much Excellence (Nor the Budget.) Original Score Is sweet but not Titanic good.(I am sure it will get Oscar Nod.) Sound mixing, Sound Editing and Film Editing is As Good As It Gets.Direction is Fine and Steady throughout the Film.Screenplay(story is traffic)is O.k. Its quiet understandable (since the movie deals with Sci-Fi and Fantasy it explains the movie 90%) but it is Predictable as well.In other words I didn't Like the screenplay Much.Its my only criticism Overall Its a Very Well Made Film in all respects.My Rating 9.5/10",positive
903,"I'm really glad James Cameron took his time perfecting this masterpiece. Oh, sure it has lots of PC politics ad nauseam, but the moral ground it stands on is firm, let's face it. Sure it demonizes humans as imperialists and murderers of indigenous peoples and the ecosystem, but there's plenty of real guilt to go around there too. But I don't care. I don't get my political views from Hollywood directors, especially one who already has egg all over his face because he thought he found Jesus' bones in a box. The cinematic fact remains that this film is not only eye-popping (especially in 3D!) but compelling as a human drama, and very well acted (even by the cgi characters!). I highly recommend that everyone see this in 3D. It uses the 3D aspect seamlessly and unobtrusively, but it really enhances the storytelling.",positive
904,"The truth is that I never had an interest in seeing this movie, but what a mistake I made.This movie is everything, it has a good story that does not let you leave the screen, with a good development that takes us into this world of fantasy and science fiction, where love, community, ambition, war and the human or inhuman we can become are involved. I love how each part of the film is divided, it shows how good writing is enough to get us into a story, since it develops the characters very well, we also understand the differences between the species that exist in the story. The action in this film is good, as well as the special effects that are spectacular, and the acting is good. It also shows us how dismissive we can be as a species, and how we want to save ourselves at the expense of the existence of another species.I think it is a movie that you have to see so that you understand the good things that are said about it, because words are not enough to express how beautiful this movie is visually and how well written it is. The only but that I put is the many coincidences that appear at crucial moments, but the truth is that it is a film that immerses you in this wonderful world of science fiction combined with fantasy and a bit of action.",positive
905,"I have never gone to a cinema with expectations like this. They were enormous, James Cameron, the great creator of films that have leaved great tracks in the world of films. Could he do it again? Could he outshine all he'd ever done before?And there I sat, in my chair. Completely entranced by the world of Na'Vi. I lost myself in amazement, I were in there world, felt what they felt, saw what they saw. I have never felt that overwhelming feeling before.Cameron has created a world on the movie screen that I never has seen before. It is so beautiful, so sharp and so convincing that i just sat there, blown away by the moment. Thats what i call movie magic, and thats what Cameron has created.I will never forget this film. It is my greatest experience i have ever had in a cinema auditorium. One word: Wonderful.",positive
906,"With this review I do not intend to defend my position of ""why did I give it 9/10"". With this review I come to defend this masterpiece of cinema.For starters, many people say ""its effects aged poorly."" And I tell you that all special effects age poorly, because day by day they evolve, and tomorrow we will say that the effects of ""Infinity War"" aged poorly.There are also some who say ""is equal to pocahontas"" ... really? Pocahontas? First of all, ""Pocahontas"" is based on a real character who lived through historical experiences from the past (google it). The conquest of Native Americans was a tragic time in history that has inspired many cinematographic works.And finally, there are those who say that the story is too conventional ... I accept that, it is true, but the way of portraying it is unconventional, it is artistically precious.It's a movie that every time I see it again, I fall in love more.",neutral
907,"Avatar was hailed for ground-breaking special effects. And on that, the new James Cameron title fully delivers. Never has CGI looked more lifelike, was the actor/CGI blend so seamless. It's certain that Avatar will do for CGI the same what Terminator 2 did: provide a benchmark for future films and their SFX. As with Terminator 2, this benchmark will be surpassed sooner or later, leaving Avatar as a historical landmark.However, once other films will copy or improve the techniques used in Cameron's latest, the lack of a good story will condemn Avatar to a second-rate movie in a few years. This one will not age well.The story told in Avatar has been told before, many times. This is not a bad point by itself. Avatar is, first and foremost, a big budget action film, so templates are expected and also quite useful to allow the viewer to get immersed into the movie more quickly.But Cameron fails to give us more than mere cut-out templates. The movie fails to give us a coherent and logical plot, relying too much on plot devices and gimmicks to deliver its message. And it also doesn't help that the original story that has been told plenty of times isn't that good to begin with. That's all the more disappointing considering that Cameron has tight control of the films he creates. So nobody blame the studio execs on this one.Still, go see it, see it in 3D if possible. It's one pretty-looking film. It's got too little plot to cover the full running time, though.",neutral
908,I find this to be one of the most engaging and beautiful movies. I honestly don't understand why some people have negative things to say.It was groundbreaking for its time and even 10 years later it still stands the test of time.I'm happy to hear we finally will be getting there sequels. James Cameron is meticulous and will wait years until the technology catches up to his dreams. I can only imagine that the second movie and those to follow will be just as visually stunning and spectacular cinematography along with memorable and lovable characters and story.Avatar will always be a beloved favorite.,positive
909,"A film you can watch without having to concentrate on the plot...because there isn't one. The film steals from previous (better) films and just hides them behind pretty visuals. The acting is preety average too - again, Cameron clearly didn't want anyone stealing the show.",neutral
910,"NO SPOILERS :) It was an excellent movie that will change your life. I was expecting it to be mediocre at best, to be honest. But, when I watched it, was I ever surprised. I wanted to glance at my friends and say ""Isn't this amazing?"" But I was so caught up in the story, in the 3D that I could not take my eyes off the screen for fear of missing even a single second of film. I've never in my life had my eyes so thoroughly glued to a movie before. At times you will laugh, at others your eyes may water. There will be moments of outrage and moments of sorrow. A movie that can capture the full range of human emotions is a da@n good movie.I have seen about an average of 100 movies a year for many years now, and I believe that if you like science fiction/fantasy and you like movies and you enjoy a decent plot that will keep you glued to your seat, you will enjoy this film. In the last 2 years I have seen 238 movies (yes I log it all in a Open Office Spreadsheet :p), and this is the best I've seen yet, and not just of the 238 I've seen in the past couple years but quite frankly, ever. That's no to say a better movie won't come out in the future, in fact I strongly believe so.The Whole time I looked and tried and tried to find a flaw in the CGI, a point where it didn't look believable when melded with the real world characters and I could not locate a single flaw. The acting was much better than I could have hoped for and as such I was impressed.In my opinion. The only people who don't like Avatar (Not to sound overtly biased) are so jealous of James Cameron that they're driven to despise all that he is and all that he makes. I know a guy like this. Won't even watch the movie in full... he downloads it, says it sucks and he's watched 75% of it here and there... and hasn't even seen it all let alone seen it in Real D 3D... something wrong with this picture? have I mentioned he is in the film industry and is struggling to find work, and failing at it regularly?",positive
911,"Some say that Avatar is one of the most amazing movies of the decade... I don't think so... For me, the most important part of a movie is its story. The reason why some movies become timeless and unforgettable (The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Forrest Gump...) is because they are so well- written and so well-directed that you can't imagine how it is gonna end. And what happened when I saw Avatar?? I had the story all figured out before it even started: The good guy infiltrates the NaVi's world by the command of the bad guy in order to find a weak spot so that they can destroy the blue people. Good guy falls in love with girl and finds out that the aliens are good people, then she gets her heart broken when she finds out about his original intentions, they have a big fight, and then good guy decides to protect the NaVi community, they win the fight and live happily ever after... Don't get me wrong, it is visually stunning, it takes creativity to come up with a world like Pandora, but if you take away all of that artwork and technology there's nothing left but a Pocahontas story, but instead of Native Americans you get blue aliens. I also understand that it has an ecological message, but come on, tell us something we don't know.It is a good movie, but it's not THE movie of the decade like some people say it is.",positive
912,"Where to start. First off it's not as bad as some people say nor is it anywhere near as good as the hype. Basically it's a tired old story and a very unoriginal telling of it to make possibly THE most over rated movie of all time. The plot if you can call it that revolves around a planet populated by hippie smurfs armed with bows and arrows who live in a rather large tree and love everything who find themselves in conflict with evil alien invaders (or Americans as the rest of us know them) who have taken a fancy to a mineral called SpongeBobanium.Now SpongeBobanium does not seem to actually do anything (because nobody mentions why it's so valuable) but does looks real cool when placed in an ashtray and used for a paperweight and is coveted by said alien invaders who have done all they can to ridicule silly native beliefs and undermine Smurfs way of life by teaching them English and importing Starbucks,Rustyburger and probably baby Jesus to no avail so have decided that killing everyone would be easier so to that end infiltrate a wheelchair bound ex marine to spy on them disguised as a 10 ft smurf. Sadly for alien invaders ex marine goes native almost instantly and falls in love with smurfette princess then proceeds to teach peace loving smurfs how to kick ass by virtue of being the chosen one as ordained by some seeds from a tree. Cue lots of learning about the power of the planet and some soul searching from evil aliens as to whether they are right to do so prior to unleashing a high tech hell onto the peace loving smurfs big tree home which leads to the big fightback scene and ultimate victory for the smurfs. So many tales have been ripped off here that the list would stretch from here to Tokyo. Needless to say very few have been told as dull as this one. Visually it is pretty neat but nowhere near the level that has been drooled over. The landscapes never look real and were better as Yes and Uriah Heep covers in the 70s and I do not believe anyone thought for a second that the smurfs look anything other than CGI generated PC game characters. Obviously JC has gathered all those game designers who worked on C&C and Alien predator as well as a few disgruntled ex Jurrasic park folks but his flora and fauna look as fake as they do in .......fill in the name of your fave PC shooter....... Fun but daft and certainly not worth the million Oscars it is up for. In the same way Titanic was over rated garbage this falls into the same category. Perhaps it has advanced film making a tad or two but even the shiny-shiny of the CGI cannot eclipse the fact the acting is poor and the script drivel. Overlong and ultimately a bit tired and old hat.The obvious Avatar 2 will be. Jake looks up at the sky lovingly and says to princess smurf. 'look a beautiful shooting star' when suddenly several thousand neutron bombs explode around him killing everything in an instant. Wait a few months for rads to die down then evil aliens come back and mine the cr#p out of smurf planet and take SpongeBobanium back home because smurfs big mistake was not realising we are even more evil then they could possibly imagine. And probably only wanted SpongeBobanium because they had it and we didn't. Earth 1 Smurfs 0......makes you proud to be human! :)",negative
913,"Strangely enough, I think, at least from one angle, the movie most similar to this one is American Beauty. Both movies were loved when they were released and hailed as some of the greatest achievements in all of cinema. But as the years passed, the backlash set in ans soon enough, you couldn't throw a stone without hitting someone who didn't like these movies.Not that this isn't also true for a lot of other movies, including Titanic, Little Miss Sunshine, and, more recently, Frozen, all of which are on this list. But all those movies still have sizable fandoms.Not so for American Beauty, a movie you have to look around to find fans of. And certainly not so for Avatar, a movie in which you have to practically be Indiana Jones to find fans of, at least on the internet. For all the technological innovations it brought upon the industry, it is a movie that not a lot of people seem to like. Basically, it is the answer to the question, ""What would LOTR's impact have been on the world if it had been disliked?"" When you say that you like this movie, the first thing that a lot of people say is that, ""But...don't you see that it's just Fern Gully (a movie that I first learned about by these comparisons), Pocahontas (Eh), and Dances With Wolves (a movie I like better than you and did not find that boring even though I watched the four-hour long version). It's not original."" (Malice is not intended, but feel free to read that in the most whiny voice possible.) Yes, it is like those movies. You fools might think that you're the explorer of your generation by realizing that. But let me break it to you: your beloved Star Wars/LOTR/Indiana Jones/ Whatever is a lot like a number of movies too.As I said in the ESB Review, there are few big budget adventure movies that are quite like other movies from decades back and books from centuries back and plays from millennia back. There are a certain amount of stories and elements that just stick close to peoples' hearts. And so those are repeated again and again. Not that this is a bad thing. I adore LOTR and many other movies that follow this formula. If you want to hate Avatar, fine, I don't care. It's not even my favorite thing with 'Avatar' in its name. But hate it for reasons that are more fully fleshed out than ""It ripped off X and Y."" By the way, after you read this review, I highly recommend reading Joseph Campbell's' Monomyth if you haven't already. It's the definitive work on what I've just described.So now that I've thrown darts at some of the reasons why people hate this movie... I suppose that I should now say why I like it. Here we go. It's not the main character, who is as forgettable as any. The rest of the actors are good and are able to elevate a middling script (people don't watch Cameron movies for the writing, though in this, as in his other movies, it's fine) but they are not great. The top honors go to Zoe Saldana, who takes a rather flat role and infuses it with humor and wit and some majesty.The music is enough to carry the film at parts. James Horner (who died just this year; RIP) puts together one of his most masterful scores. That statement is impressive considering that this a man who scored more great movies than many people have even watched and who composed the Titanic soundtrack, which sold more copies than any other mostly orchestral soundtrack in history. It feels tribal and majestic yet lively and energetic, and is a good fit for the film as well as a good listen on its own right.But that's not why I love the movie. I love it because of its world. Some would say that you have to separate the technical accomplishments from those of the film. But as an 'atmosphere and tone' guy, I say that's impossible. That would be like asking someone to go to Costa Rica but only to do activities, not to check out the scenery.Simply preposterous. And the film is impressive sight. I do believe that I've never seen a live-action film that managed to wow me as much as this one did. Anyone who doesn't think this film looks good doesn't believe that the best CGI is not only supposed to mimic reality, but to fundamentally enhance it. I do. This is also why I love the Hobbit movies more than you, though they are not on this list.Not including this film on this list would be like not including the moon landing on a list of the top 100 moments in the twentieth history. It was such a step forward that to ignore it would be leaving a gaping hole in your layout. And so, while I go back to party under Hometree with the Na'vi and give props to whoever made its language, I will end with two final thoughts.One: this film should have won in the Oscars over The Hurt Locker. That still hurts, even now.Two: thank you, haters, for moving onto this film and off one my ten favorite films of all time, Titanic. Just sayin'.",positive
914,"I have never written a movie review, I am certainly not an idolater of James Cameron, but I just saw Avatar in 3D on a tiny screen at in my local cinema and felt compelled to say how impressed I was. In the past, I have left Cameron movies feeling a bit duped (Titanic) by stunning use of technology to mask derivative stories. This was different. He takes a story derived from traditional American lore and then creates a new alien world with a fully immersed cultural experience. The best comparison I can offer is to a movie like Last of the Mohegans, which offers you the amazing experience of running with a different people, and for a couple (or 3) hours, feeling like you see the world through there eyes, with awe of their skills and appreciation for their beliefs. This is like that, except it's a world invented and created by James Cameron. For his success in using new movie technology to bring us into his imagination Cameron deserves the applause, and money... or most of it.",positive
915,"Say what you will about AVATAR, but there is no avoiding it. It is truly one of the best & most unique movie experiences I've ever had. Of course this was the 1st time I've ever seen a movie in 3-D + IMAX combined.I still think that THE HURT LOCKER is the best film of the year only because it is THAT good. Both are (& will become) classics.AVATAR stands in a class completely by itself. More than 2 days later I'm still buzzing about it. Comparisons to the rush that STAR WARS gave you are entirely accurate.The best thing that Cameron did with the 3-D is that he never shoves it at you. He (+ the 1000 or so other magicians who worked on this movie) allows you to wander into each frame (is that word even applicable here?) & become surrounded by it. It is a totally immersive feeling. The camera movement is not content with being locked down. It moves to give you further perspective of the amazing world before you. The tech achievements are astounding & I could on & on about ""performance capture"" & its success only to say that I felt that the Na'vi --the blue people-- were every bit as real as the humans.The story is somewhat predictable & there's nothing in the performances that'll rock you like Jeremey Renner's work in ""...Locker"" (although Stephen Lang is quite good as the hard core military guy). But the actors & the script rise enough to make you really care about what happens to them. Zoe Saldana's Na'vi beauty & spirit is quite something to marvel at (what a year she has had with this & Uhura)when you later think that she was basically digital.It may not be the ""movie of the year"" but, contrarily, make no mistake about it AVATAR is the movie EVENT of the decade.",positive
916,"I took my girl to see Avatar tonight and we both were so impressed with this movie, Avatar I would be put in the top ten movies of 2009 it was as good as Transformers 2 or Star Trek. And it will be a movie I will get as soon as it hit's DVD or I think I might even finally even get Blu-Ray. The 3D grafx were great and digital work for the characters was outstanding, if Cameron doesn't take a lot of the awards in the academy awards I think they would get so much hate mail, this was one film that I can't wait to see 2 and 3... I would also would love to see more about Pandora as well as the Na 'Vi. I would really like to see this series finding it's way in to the books like Star Wars or Star Trek",positive
917,"In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like, moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) heads the mining operation, employing marines for security. The corporation intends to exploit Pandora's reserves of a valuable mineral called unobtanium. Pandora is inhabited by the Na'vi, a blue-skinned species of sapient humanoids with feline characteristics. Physically much stronger and taller than humans, the Na'vi live in harmony with Nature, worshiping a mother goddess called Eywa. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and must use gas masks. Attempting to improve relations with the natives and learn about Pandora's biology, scientists grow Na'vi bodies modified with human DNA, called avatars, that are controlled by genetically-matched, mentally-linked human operators. The film focuses on Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former marine that despite having no training whatsoever, becomes an operator.Avatar has been in development since 1994 and it's James Cameron's first film in over 10 years. With an estimated budget of $280,000,000, Avatar is one of the most expensive films ever made. Thankfully for Cameron, the film is already the second highest grossing film of all time by ranking in 1.14 billion at the global box office. Cameron's previous film, Titanic is still number one but not for much longer. So, is all the hype and buzz surrounding this film justified? Not really. Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction, having done the Terminator films but, here he really tried to push the envelope; was he successful? Kind of. Visually, there's no denying it, Avatar is impressive, and it's not so much that the film is in 3D (sometimes you don't even notice it is and this kind of technology has clearly a long way to go still) but more the fact that Cameron imagined a pretty cool world. Pandora has some beautiful landscapes (computer-generated obviously) and you can tell that a lot of work was invested in the visual aspect of the film. The avatars were also very well done and if you look closely, you'll see the resemblance to the actors.Unfortunately, Avatar is very weak story-wise. The plot is a melange of age-old stories. It's very simplistic, childish even and has been done countless times: assimilation of an individual into a new culture, a cross-culture love story, heroic uprising against oppressors. The dialog is not that great either and on top of that there's a few plot holes and inconsistencies and the film is overlong. The monumental battle scenes and the grandiose music give an epic feeling to the film but the thin plot is impossible to overlook and really drags the film down. Sam Worthington was pretty good as Jake Sully and he has proved once again that he is leading man material. On the other hand, the praise Zoe Saldana has received for her performance is puzzling. The actress doesn't have any screen time. She only borrows her voice (and some of her movements were captured) to a character and I don't quite understand how that can be considered a great performance. Sigourney Weaver, the most experienced actress of the cast was actually disappointing.Overall, Avatar is not a bad film, the problem is the plot plays second to the visuals. The film was extremely over-hyped and while it might be impressive on a technical level, it's not a great film by any means let alone a masterpiece or the next step in entertainment.6/10",neutral
918,"When I first saw this in theaters, I thought it was one of the most pleasing visual experiences I've ever encountered. While it is amazing visually, story-wise it lacks. A lot of people are giving this movie 10/10 ratings over the simple fact that the visual work looks nice. Problem was, this movie was made for the sole intention of being 3D, and seen in 3D.So naturally, since I enjoyed it in theaters, I thought I would purchase the DVD for enjoyment at home. I took some time tonight to watch it, and realized that I wasn't as wowed as I was when I first saw it. Perhaps it's because I don't have a $6000 3DTV, but rather I watched it on a 50 inch plasma.Here's some of the problems with this film: First, the storyline is unoriginal. It was very well written and put together, but the base concept was about acceptance, and respecting that other people are different than you, that doesn't mean you can take what's theirs. This storyline has been done 300 other times before. Maybe it would have seemed more original if the script wasn't shelved for 9 years.Second, too much was crammed into a film. It started slow, didn't get to the point fast enough, and much of the story from the beginning is easily forgettable. Let's face it, the battle scenes where the awesome, but that's about it. The rest of the movie is easily forgettable. I'm not one for sappy love stories, but there could have been more character development within the relationship of the two.Third, much of the storyline was filled with plot holes. Jake ""died"" within 40 seconds of lacking oxygen, yet the Colonel was able to fire a whole clip of ammunition and fire a pistol at the chopper. Makes no sense.Fourth, some of the story was poorly acted. I'm convinced that it was the story itself, and not the actors. You can easily tell that some of the lines were rather cheesy, and being that Jake really thought he was part of their world, it felt awkward when he was trying to talk like them about spirits and whatnot.I suppose it's not a huge turn-off, but the story could have been easily compressed down into 1 hour and 40 minutes or so. To me, there was too much, the story didn't make sense at times due to plot holes, and there was virtually limited character development, and I feel like it was far too long. When you are getting sore from sitting in the same place too long, that's when a film is too long.",positive
919,"There were disappointments, but I'll save those for last ...I went to this screening with higher expectations than I had for any film in quite a long time. I opted for the 3-D version to see how 3-D has progressed and was not disappointed. In fact, I was very pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the 3-D presentation. The technique was better integrated into this film than any other example I've seen; creating a nice standard text on things to do right if you want to make a good quality 3-D movie. Most films seem to add 3-D as an afterthought, barely making any impact on the presentation and sadly lacking imagination and creativity. That was not true with this offering, it was very creative and superbly imaginative. Avatar is a stunningly creative integration of the 3-D effect into the entire scope of the film to sometimes breathtaking result.That being said, lets explore the rest of the film: I did love the rest of the CGI effects, the best I've seen to date in any film. The look of the planet imagined here is the best I've seen - I wonder what Ray Harryhausen thinks of the current state of the art as seen here? The sets, in fact, the whole visual presentation apart from the 3-D were equally outstanding. Saying it is a visually stunning, superb film would not be too effusive in praise.The cast was excellent throughout, creating a wonderful film that will doubtless become a classic. Stephen Lang did a masterful job with the Colonel Miles Quaritch character, injecting just enough sinister personality to make a worthy antagonist to the bluish aliens; the Na'vi on the planet Pandora. Hardest to judge were the characters of Jake Sully, portrayed by Sam Worthington, and Neytiri, played with great gusto by the exotic and erotic Zoe Saldana. My problem with these characters is I don't know where their craft as actors departed from the CGI. The end results, however, were wonderful characters with more depth than one usually finds in science fiction films; especially Saldana's contribution. Zoe Saldana managed to make her character charmingly feminine and sexy as well as fiercely brave and courageous; something most actresses have trouble doing credibly in action movies. Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacon, and Giovanni Ribisi as the patently evil Parker Selfridge were all outstanding; adding a lot to the film's realism and credibility.I couldn't help but notice how scrupulously careful the makers were to avoid showing even a glimpse of an alien breast - I suppose there are Christian censors on Pandora too. I imagine many will think the Na'vi were styled after African and Native American culture. Perhaps they'd be right. I think it must have been difficult to concoct too exotic of an alien culture or it may have been too time consuming to present. It is at least solidly done and well constructed.One thing that must be applauded is the richness of the flora and fauna created for the planet Pandora. The film makers outdid themselves in that department; doing so well that at times the abundance and richness they injected into the film nearly overshadow the rest of what was going on in the film. Great touches in that regard was how small objects, insects, floating leaves, etc., were used to enhance the 3-D effects to stunning success.I'm likely in a very small minority of film goers who are disappointed with anything in this film. It undeniably outshines even the classics like Star Wars. Still, it missed the mark for me in a couple of areas. The elements that really let me down (more disappointing than I can describe) were the overall technology depictions of the earth people - referred to by the Na'vi as ""sky people"". Considering that the time-frame when this story was supposed to take place is 2154, 145 years from now, some of what the film makers chose to depict as examples of the preeminent technology of that time were terribly late-twentieth century-ish.I may be prejudiced by having spent decades working with the military's most technologically advanced weapon systems, but it didn't seem to me that it should be so much of a stretch to do better considering the effort that went into every other element of the film. For example, I know how to creatively solve the problem of interstellar travel in a much more entertaining way and hoped someone in the film's production end would catch on, but it wasn't to be.Also disappointing were the rather contemporary - to our time - communications, weapons and aircraft; there won't be anything like what they chose 145 years from now. And the oxygen masks; not very creative there either.Last, but certainly not least, were the disappointingly 20th century clothing. I certainly would have liked more imagination there. Perhaps the most noticeable example being the strategically snipped wife-beater that Michelle Rodriguez wore.I did like the visuals for what they did with the computer depictions but I think even those could have been done better.Well, maybe next time . . .The disappointments were easily forgivable (even the uncomfortable 3-D glasses were forgotten shortly into the film) considering the tremendous overall visual quality of every single thing they put on screen. There are not enough words of praise to adequately recommend this film as great entertainment with the caveat that in spite of the PG-13 rating and the exclusion of bluish alien breasts, it is very violent; so some parents may wish to consider that before toddling their offspring off to a Saturday afternoon at the movies.",positive
920,"A technical wonder built on recycled components. Like its Oscar competitors ""District 9"" and ""The Hurt Locker"", James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is an amazing technical achievement (although with a $270million production budget, one would hope so) but not an overwhelming compelling story. Cameron turns his ""Aliens"" plot of bad-guy aliens infecting humans on its head -- good-guy aliens must defend themselves against humans who have figured out how to infiltrate genetic copies of the aliens. The alien ""Na'vi"" strike more than a passing resemblance to native American tribes or at least a Hollywood version of peaceful, nature-respecting, earth-connected natives. Cameron's aliens are all lightness and good even beyond those found in Disney's ""Pocahontas"". Cameron's bad guys are the Marines from his ""Aliens"" feature and the sleazy corporate executive role first played by comedian Paul Reiser. Sigourney Weaver also returns and provides the middle ground between the sweetness-and-light aliens and the rapacious humans as well as providing the technical bridge our hero, Jake Sully (boy, there's a movie character name) takes to transform, like Wikus in ""District 9, into one of the aliens. Cameron throws in some mountable, flying dragons from ""Eragon"", some ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaurs some of which fly and some of why have hammerhead shark heads and most lazily some ""Beauty and the Beast"" wolves and ""Dances With Wolves"" horses with a few extra legs thrown in. Yes, you've seen it all before elsewhere but never rendered by someone with 5 years and nearly $300 million to spend. The effects are immersive and impressively seamless; I especially liked that the arrows thrown around by the 11 foot Na'vi look like spears when they puncture the hapless humans. In short, in this year's Best Picture Oscar race, ""Avatar"" is the New York Yankees and we all know how that series turned out.",positive
921,"Avatar (2009) follows an ex-marine as he is deployed to the moon of Pandora on a unique mission. This movie is so impressive and definitely improves upon a rewatch. It's understandable as to why it got so much hype when it came out, it's very ahead of it's time!The film has gorgeous visuals right from the start and is honestly one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. The CGI is groundbreaking, and holds up so well, even to today's standards. I really like the creature designs too, they are unique and impressive. The colour palettes are very beautiful, and I particularly like the lack of colour grading after the destruction of the Hometree, it reflects the mood well and is very stylistic. The movie does it's action sequences well, with some great camerawork and a good use of slow motion.There's a lot of effective sound design, and a brilliant score to go alongside it. The score adds to the atmosphere and beauty of the film, it really helps immerse the audience and enhance the world-building.The acting is very good and I deeply cared for all of the characters. The relationships between them feel real too, and the actors have a lot of natural chemistry. Sigourney Weaver gives a brilliant performance and I grew to love her character a lot, and I also adore Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri, who really puts her all into her performance.The film sets the story up well, and is a consistently entertaining and fun watch. It's paced incredibly well with a lot of high tension moments and it's a film I find very emotional and touching, it makes me cry a lot! The movie is the perfect length and manages to be immersive and gripping all throughout.",positive
922,"I gave it a 6 out of 10 only because of the amazing special effects, the visuals, and the 3D. The film is only worth seeing on the big screen in 3D. The story is by no means original. It is basically a cross between ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Dune."" First (the Dune story), they go to the planet to mine one of the rarest elements in the universe. The main character then befriends the inhabitants and leads them into war against the invaders. Second (Dances With Wolves), a soldier becomes friends with the Indians (Avatar aliens ride horses, shoot bows and arrows, and are ""at one with nature""), becomes one of them, and leads them to victory against his own people. Then there is the ""evil corporation"" element from another Cameron film ""Aliens."" This film was definitely a little too ""politically correct.""",neutral
923,"Well I couldn't agree less with what people said about this movie. As a painter, I did enjoy the realistic animation, it was amazing indeed. I could imagine how hard it was to achieve. It definitely pleases the eye.But... yes, there is a BIG but - the story was more than plain. I had that feeling I've seen that movie and I knew exactly what's going to happen - good guy meets a girl, falls in love, betrays her, the bad guys decide it's time to kick some butt, but the good guy gives a powerful speech and everybody goes 'hooray', some of the good guys will die, there will be a final battle between the main hero and the bad guy, well guess who won.. I actually had a bet with a friend on how will the movie end. Anyway, through the whole act, I had the feeling I've written that movie and know exactly how it'll end - and that's not something I want to experience when seeing a movie.So basically I did enjoy the visual effects but the story didn't please me enough to like the movie.",neutral
924,"This is one of my best decisions in my life and worst (regarding movies). To wait until 2022 to watch for the first time this masterpiece.It's been brilliant from begining to end. Being a SF fan i'm starting to wonder wtf happened to the film industry that they no longer produce such masterpieces.This remarkable movie isn't just a masterpiece in it's originality, but it also beautifully and harshly (at the same time) gives all of us a reminder about what is trully important for us as humans and for us as individuals.I won't put any spoilers or indicators about how the movie goes because maybe there's someone like me that still hasn't seen it. Well it's a must.I'm so glad they made more movies. I just hope they didn't make them just for the sake of it as it's now in custom.",positive
925,"Far, far, far too many approach this film as if narrative originality is the sole criteria to judge a film on. It is true that the film has a lot in common with several other Nature's Gentlemen stories released in the past 40 years. The overall film conforms to the Dances with Wolves template. (The special edition, the far stronger cut, even adds a ""buffalo"" hunt) But Jake Sully is no mere Lt. Dunbar clone. Far too many commentators do not take into account that Sully is disabled. Moreover, his disability renders him ""not a man"" in the eyes of the American-sorry Earthican-power structure. This marginalization and Jake's desire to be seen as fully masculine greatly shift much of the tonalities of the narrative. (It does raise a different set of difficulties around disability). So much so that if you think the story is just the Nature's Gentlemen trope you are not paying attention. The film is highly critical of Western civilization and technology from the perspective of many type of people, not just the First People (the obvious analog for the Na'vi). The irony of what the film is about and how it was made of course isn't lost on Cameron and the attentive viewer will find metacommentary. The story is good; all stories deploy tropes. Avatar is just a bit more obvious in where its narrative ideas come from.Anyway, qualms about the narrative are largely besides the point. The film is so unbelievably good because it is an experience. I mean this in the sense that a very vivid thunderstorm is an experience. The film stands apart from not only the other films that use the same tropes but most other works period. Through the use of absolutely cutting edge and breath taking CGI, exquisite art direction and the director's hand the film is completely immersive the way very few films are. To use a quick example, Cameron sparingly uses POV shots at critical moments, i.e. When getting off the ship for the first time, Jake waking up in the Avatar. This not only highlights Jake's journey but place you in the world of the film. Pandora is so wonderfully realized. I simply cannot wait for the sequels to see more of this stuff.There is a bluntness to writing-unobtainium, Grace, Selfridge Shock and Awe-that is often mocked but I find that the bluntness fits. The story's anti-colonialism is sadly always relevant. And there is something utterly satisfying watching the Americans-sorry Earthicans-lose to nature for once. The film's politics are hamfisted for sure but how could they not be? The film is all italics and boldness.This is a truly great film.",positive
926,I didn't know that most of this film is CG until 2 years after release. No words to explain about film.,positive
927,"The concept of humans in the planet of beautiful landscapes, and a tribe of blue alien species called the Na'vi were very creative and original.Ground-breaking special effects and visuals in CGI effects that were very good, unlike anything we've seen before the film was released. Best of all, it led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D Televisions and caused 3D films to increase in popularity. And most of it still holds up today.The characters are quite terrific, especially Zoe Saldana's character:Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him.Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language.Dr. Grace Augustine, an exobiologist and head of the Avatar Program. She is also Sully's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English
Trudy Chac√≥n, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi.Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane.Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program. He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Sully and operates an avatar.Neytiri, the daughter of the leader of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naivet√© and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan.It launched Zoe Saldana's career along with the Star Trek reboot.It has an amazing environmental and anti-war message.The acting is very excellent, especially for Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang.Has amazing scenery on Pandora.The soundtrack that was performed by the late James Horner is amazing as always, with a mix of beautiful, dramatic stuff too.""I See You"" by Leona Lewis, featured in the end credits, was a decent song.The extraterrestrial species called the Na'vi of the planet looks very cool. In addition, the Na'vi are really clever because they know how to ride on the creatures.The action sequences are really interesting and awesome.Beautiful, smooth cinematography for 2009, making you like you're on a beautiful full planet of paradise.",positive
928,"This movie is undoubtedly a landmark achievement in Cinema history. This movie will not disappoint anyone and will grab your imagination and never let it go for the entire length of the film. James Cameron has undone himself with Avatar and has combined Creativity, Audacity, talent to create this unparalleled masterpiece. The sheer scope of the movie is unbelievable considering that it was done through CGI technology and the characters in the story are captivating. Same Worthington will be remembered for his spectacular portrayal in the film. Jason Lang and Sigourny Weaver make dramatic returns to the big screen and both are at their best in this film. Michelle Rodgriguez will be remembered for her wise-cracking roll in this film. Zoe Saldona, Wes Tudi, C.C.H. Pounder, and Las Alonso have brought believability to their characters in the Na'vi tribe. Forget about box-office numbers and expectations, this film will stand alone as a monumental artistic achievement.",neutral
929,"After gathering my thoughts, I will preface this by saying this is a difficult film to review. Specifically, while there were some things I liked about the movie, there are other things I found off-putting.First, let's highlight the strengths. Technically, this was a beautiful film to watch. To get a good experience, I would definitely recommend this in 3D rather than 2D. The imagination put into the world, coupled with the computer imagery, are definitely gripping. The development of the alien species and planet of Pandora was also very remarkable, from language to culture. The special effects are definitely a step towards making computer imagery more lifelike than ever (however, I will stop short of saying ""like nothing you'll ever see...more later). Second, Sam Worthington is the anchor of this movie; very charismatic, but does punctuate his performance with some subtleties that make him more human than others. Third, the sci-fi technology is believable, in the vein of the 2 ""Alien"" movies.That being said, let's hit the weaknesses. First and foremost, the story was almost a complete rip of ""Dances with Wolves"", except in space. Very off-putting, as I think for the time and effort that was put into the film and development of the aliens, I was expecting something more original. Come to think of it, it reminded me of another popcorn movie, Independence Day, but took itself more seriously. Special effects are nice, but if a story is lacking, it can make the experience tedious. Second, when considering the other performances apart from Worthington's (and I include alien ones), they were relatively flat or overacted. Even poor Sigourney Weaver, an actress I really like on the whole, was underutilised in her role. Third, I previously stressed that the movie had to be seen in 3D; I say this because prior to going into this film, I had seen previews, and was not very convinced of the ground-breaking effects. The 3D experience definitely enhances the viewing experience (though I wouldn't say it's a roller-coaster ride), but I could easily say if I had seen it in 2D, my review may have been lower. Finally, like I previously said, the effects were a step above computer imagery as we have seen it. But would I say it had the same gripping experience of first seeing ""Star Wars"", or the T-1000 of ""Terminator 2"", or even the computer generated scenery of ""Phantom Menace"" (which I gave a similar rating for based on story)? Definitely not.In conclusion, I would still recommend watching the movie, with some conditions. First, it must be seen in 3D (IMAX if possible); 2D would only spoil the experience (would definiely not rent it until 3D TV comes out). Second, story expectations should be low (like going to see an IMAX museum film--go for the scenery, discard the story). In the end, it reminded me of my experience listening to Sgt. Pepper; I appreciate the historical technical advances it made, and even like parts of the album, but would still put other albums well above it from a satisfaction standpoint.",positive
930,"Hi, I've seen this movie before in my head. I did not miss anything in my mind. I did not understand the story. It was a coincidence that I decided to see you again. Good. Excellent. I did not have one of the best movies of history with special effects. Drama of the drama of the drama is beautiful and excellent. Humanitarian. For the Environment. James Cameron",positive
931,"The movie was beautiful! Utterly breathtaking. The plot was a fine familiar old story set in a new context.!!!Spoiler alertI was with the story all the way up to the battle. That battle, the way it was fought and won undermined if not obviated a key theme in the story; that ignorance is a weakness.The natives of the planet had this profound connection with the planet and definitively meager weapons. Yet when composing a strategy to go up against the heavily militarized opponent they chose a very direct head to head/charge of the light brigade approach, and were subsequently slaughtered. Granted they were victorious but only by the providence of of a god.I thought the film would have been a lot more compelling if the lead character had composed a strategy that took into account the natives unique capacities and his unique knowledge of the humans' approach and weaponry. Had he done so he would have demonstrated the power of knowledge. the natives' victory would have occurred with significantly less loss on both sides. Seems to me that that outcome would be more in keeping with the manner of this new being he had become and the world he was trying to preserve.For instance, the weaponry of the human force was hobbled by the weird magnetic fields of that area, but the natives were wired into this huge world brain that senses everything. Did the natives use that to their advantage by leading the enemy onto itself, no. I once heard that the defining characteristic of science fiction is that the science, the unique technology, etc plays a role in the plot. This had the potential to be that but instead it was just the same old fairy tale about a civilized man being reborn when he goes native. *yawn*Nice graphics though. You should peal off .05% of that CG budget and hire a few writers next time. Or perhaps it was just written to a perceived audience. The one that somehow needs to reconcile a tale about conservation, tolerance and respect with the manner of a society that will employ military force to exploit and even destroy resources, cultures, and even species all for sake if short term profit.",positive
932,"Seriously... seriously people. To say the movie stinks or the story isn't original.... seriously, that's why you're giving it a 1? How many movies have non original stories and we still watch them and enjoy them. Yes the idea of the story in itself has been told many times, but when it has been told it's normally been met with approval (dances with wolves, last samurai, Pocahontas, etc etc etc), but the world that James Cameron has created is incredible. It's not my favorite movie but it definitely gets undeserved hate from people that have jumped on the anti avatar bandwagon. Just appreciate it for what it is. A retelling of a story that we all know and have seen before in a completely original world. Ya the story is predictable... so what. It's visually incredible. Don't be swayed by band wagon haters. It's the keyboard hero culture that we now live in.",positive

Computer generated visual vomit in which gun-ho marines endeavour to annihilate feeble alien beings until one of morons jumps ship and saves the alien nation and thus becomes their leader.A script written on the back of a cigarette packet that basically tells us how totally awesome America is and how they can both destroy us or be our savior. The film is aimed at men with small penises, men with the mental ages of 14 year old's, men who masturbated over computer generated alien women and men who are socially inept.",negative
935,"After Terminator and Aliens, we got Avatar, set on a distant moon in a distant galaxy. We get a handicapped young soldier and his quest to seek out Pandora (the moon) and see the sights and help his company. Plus, we also get Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. And an all-new alien world. The special effects didn't hurt either. Sure, the story is a little cliched (Ferngully and Dances With Wolves anyone?) but it's not bad. The Na'vi stole the show as the moon's indigenous people and their customs and various creatures were so beautiful. This makes me curious for the followups. Hope they'll expand the whole Avatar story even further!",positive
936,"James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is not just a film; it's an immersive experience that transports viewers to a lush, vibrant world teeming with life and wonder. From the moment the film opens on the glowing skies of Pandora, it's immediately clear that we are witnessing a groundbreaking fusion of storytelling and technology, where the boundaries of cinema have been pushed beyond imagination.The intricate world-building is one of the film's most commendable accomplishments. Each creature, each plant, and each breathtaking landscape feels meticulously crafted, inviting audiences to lose themselves in its beauty. Cameron has not simply created a setting; he has conjured an entire ecosystem that is rich with culture and spirituality, exploring themes of environmentalism and the interconnectedness of all living things.At its core, ""Avatar"" tells a timeless story of conflict, belonging, and identity. Jake Sully's journey from a disabled marine to a fierce protector of the Na'vi people reflects a transformative arc that resonates on both personal and universal levels. The Na'vi, with their deep connection to nature and their rich traditions, serve as a compelling counterpoint to human recklessness, challenging viewers to reflect on their own relationship with the planet.The revolutionary use of 3D technology deserves special mention. It isn't just a gimmick; it enhances the narrative, making audiences feel like active participants in the adventure. The breathtaking visuals are complemented by a haunting score that evokes a range of emotions, further immersing viewers into the heart of Pandora.""Avatar"" isn't without its critiques, as some argue that the plot may feel familiar or derivative. However, even if the core narrative mirrors classic themes found in literature and film, Cameron's execution transforms it into a poignant reflection of our own world. The film serves as a mirror, prompting a dialogue about colonialism, environmental stewardship, and corporate greed, making it deeply relevant despite the fantastical setting.""Avatar"" stands as a landmark in cinematic history-not merely for its pioneering special effects but for its ability to invoke feelings of wonder, empathy, and urgent introspection. It's a film that challenges us to envision a better world while reminding us of the beauty we risk losing. As we traverse through the breathtaking landscapes of Pandora, we are left with an enduring message: to cherish and protect the home we inhabit, ensuring that such beauty continues to thrive for generations to come.",positive
937,"Watching it, you experience a feeling of such freedom and inspiration inside, which James Cameron wanted to give the viewer. You experience these feelings with the main character, who, in a new body, was able to walk, run, and fly. Together with him you fight for freedom. Undoubtedly, the film deservedly broke into the top sci-fi films thanks to a huge number of computer-generated 3D special effects that simply brought cinema to a new level. The film definitely feels the director's scrupulous and precise approach to every detail, thanks to which almost three hours look in one breath.",positive
938,"I would like to start off by saying... How goddamn rich is James Cameron that he can direct movies like this and Titanic which just happens to be 2 of the most expensive movies made? Not only is he rich but he is obviously mega talented as well seeing that both those movies recieved way more money than he used on them. With that said...Avatar was a beautiful film with an equally beautiful score with some amazing fight scenes that will baffle you. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana did decent jobs as our main characters and the plot was decent too albeit somewhat generic. But that was the good. Now for the bad.The romance in this film was unnecessary and yes I know that, that was a important plot point for the story but honestly I just don't like romance in my movies. They're boring and personally I think a waste of time. They only work in movies like Titanic or other more drama like movies. Also the characters were just not likeable to me personally except for our mc's. The rest were just meh and I didn't even feel for any of them. These two thing were pretty much the only qualms I had with ""Avatar"", other than that, a brilliantly stunning movie.",positive
939,"This film is about the invasion of humans into a distant planet Pandora, where Na'vis live, to mine a precious metal.Pandora is depicted with such realistic and poetic beauty, and is sculpted with such a human touch. I feel Pandora could be my home. It makes me care for the Na'vis and their world. I feel so connected with them, that I feel all their emotions. I feel so close to them that I am almost one of them. Coupled with the amazing visual effects that are stunningly real. ""Avatar"" is a very strong film which makes 2.5 hours seem far too short. I watched in good old 2D but it already manages to blow me away.I seldom can enjoy or even understand science fiction movies, but ""Avatar"" is exceptional as I managed to understand and enjoy it. In fact, I even concentrated on the film and loved it. The story is simple but it parallels many current affairs in our world of sky people.

While the visual effects are absolutely fantastic, the film lacks an innovative story. From the beginning to end, Avatar is a predictable fare that only sustains on the back of its spectacle. Even encouraging performances by Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana can't cover the films cringe-worthy dialogue, one-dimensional characters, and safe, clich√©d narrative. So while Cameron spent 10 years waiting for technology to improve, and an additional 5 years developing Avatar's effects, what the hell happened to the script? He should have realized that the visual splendor of Pandora could only hide Avatar's lack of heart so long.",neutral

The acting was horrible, the only good acting was done by Weaver, and may I add she still looks great in ever form. Though he spent millions on 3D which is great for future films, but does not make it a good movie. And these graphics were not that great, because nothing looks real.

From all the hype I had heard, I at least expected it to be a LITTLE better than the stupid trailers. But no, all I got was a terribly boring, super dumb storyline. This movie was incredibly hard to sit through. I felt like a five year old watching a bunch of giant blue people run through the forest. How this movie earned 2 billion dollars I will never know. It was all hype, and I guess people were just brainwashed into believing this movie was spectacular. I'm appalled that this movie got such high ratings--the crisp graphics were not worth it whatsoever. This movie is a total waste of money and is like a punishment to watch. I highly recommend saving your money or seeing something else. Even spending $1 at RedBox is a giant waste. I can't believe this was the movie everyone was ranting and raving over. The plot is been there-done that, spans for an unnecessarily long amount of time, and is just so boring! I can't stress enough how much of a snooze-fest this was. Even the graphics couldn't make this more interesting. Not even worth sitting through for free.",negative
946,"This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don't like the story resent the environmental vs. Military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God's sake. This is full of spectacle, ""humanity,"" and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I'm surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren't complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren't as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format.

We are transported to an intricately designed world, complete with a Neolithic race of aliens, rich with culture and traditions, speaking its own uniquely linguistically engineered on-screen language (A Cinema First)As for the ""It's Anti-American!"" grumblings:1) The troops were not even U. S., they were corporate hired guns!2) Life isn't about winning or losing battles, it's about living in harmony with one's environment...Or at least that's how we saw it. Wow! Talk about nefarious agendas!In the opening seconds, James Cameron seems to pay tribute to both 2001 and Star Wars. Some reviewers have mentioned a similitude to Pocahontas. There were different moments that conjured up memories of story threads from many different films, but thematically, Dances With Wolves was, in my opinion at lrast, perhaps, closest.However, a straight up comparison to any other film does not do AVATAR justice. It is totally in a league of its own!Every aspect of AVATAR is practically hyperbole-proof. Just look at the plethora of gushing reviews. Yet, amazingly, there are some 2*, even 1* ratings! Honestly, I can't fathom how anyone who has ventured more than 100 miles from their place of birth could rate it less than 5*. (The word Provincial keeps popping into my head!)Closing words: The only film in my life that raised the cinematic bar more was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968) Don't just see AVATAR...Experience it!....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are most welcome!",positive
948,"For being 10 times the amount of money I would normally spend on a movie, I had hoped that this would be worth it. As per my previous stance on 3-D, I was hesitant on going to this film when it first came out. However, since I did some reading up on what forces went on behind this film, I decided to give the 3-D experience a try. What an experience it was! I can see why the film industry was really pushing for more movies to be in 3-D because it is spectacular. The glasses weren't uncomfortable, and if you took them off for a second, it wasn't a terrible color-shifted image, it was just slightly blurry. Although, one thing that 3-D cinema is going to have to fix is to have more things in focus. You can't rely on previous film-making techniques here.At any rate, if you can get over the blatantly anti-corporation and anti-military message, it's really quite a good movie and should be seen due at least to the fact that this is the reason James Cameron got into making movies in the first place. We can all blame him for ripping off Dances with Wolves (1990) or Pocahontas (1995) but if you can get past that, there's a great movie here, regardless.What really stands out with this film is its visuals. Despite the amount of CGI used to create the fictional world of Pandora, it's incredibly difficult to tell what is CGI and what is merely a human in front of a green screen. Just by the strength of these visuals alone, this film should be viewed by movie aficionados. Not only was the 3-D technology used to film it revolutionary, but the facial mapping techniques really helped bring these actors to life in their blue, alien bodies.A stunning visual treat that has yet to be matched, I give Avatar 4.5 stars out of 5.",positive
949,"I'll give the effects a 10 without hesitation. The 3D was well done, without a bunch of cheesy effects meant to simply exploit the 3D. After just a short time I forgot about the 3D part and just let it take me into an alien world with incredible realism.But the storyline was basically a left-wing environmentalist propaganda piece. It started out good for the 1st half of the show, then became a predictable plot with blatant preaching.Still, it is worth going just for the cinematic experience, if you can look past a shallow plot with a painfully obvious political agenda.If you're not too sharp on picking up political undertones and just want a love story / action movie, then you'll be quite satisfied.",positive
950,"I really felt that The Legendary filmmaker surpassed Cinema in 'True Lies' & 'Titanic', but after watching his latest offering 'Avatar', I am left awe-struck.Nothing on earth can stop 'Avatar', An Outstanding Piece Of Work That Will Shine Till The Day Cinema Lives! A Visual Delight!'Avatar' is an Outstanding film, I have never enjoyed a film so so so much. Cameron takes you in the world of Pandora, he takes you to the roots, he sucks you into this filmy world completely. 'Avatar' even shows the selfish side of us, ""Human Beings', how far can we go for our needs. Cameron's supremacy returns, it's been 12 years, agreed... so what, he gives a film that we'll remember forever! 'Avatar' cannot be missed by anyone, and I mean anyone!! Performance wise, Sam Worthington is superb as Jake Sully, playing his part with great understanding. Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, though she's an animation throughout, she has dubbed beautifully. Sigourney Weaver is first-rate as usual. Stephen Lang is fabulous as the conniving bad-man. Giovanni Ribisi is superb in a brief role. Michelle Rodriguez is in form after a long, long time. She excels. Joel Moore as Norm is likable. Others, the rest of Na'vi are perfect.James Cameron's 'Avatar' is a film that shines, with a rare aura. Go visit Pandora right now! Watching this film should be a agenda for a Cinema Fan Forever! Twenty Big Thumbs Up!",positive
951,"Avatar looks great. You can see where the millions of dollars have spent in the making of it. The forest and flying scenes are brilliantly done. The technology enabling the movement of the native people to be based on the actions of the actor playing them is flawless. However for my first 3D movie and I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more arrows flying past my shoulder. Maybe my expectations were a bit high! I prefer my films with a bit of character development and a decent story and here Avatar is a bit lacking. The story is about an ex-marine working for a company hoping to make a fortune from the ""Unobtainium"" (really) found in abundance on the planet of Pandora. The cynical executives running the company pay lip service to environmentalism by building schools for the natives and employing scientists. However they also have a large army of mercenaries who will be used to remove the natives if they won't go voluntarily. They have also developed genetically modified ""avatars"". They look like the natives but are mind linked to human controllers. They hope to use them to persuade the natives that it would be in their best interest to move. Eventually our hero, through his avatar, ends up living with the natives and falls in love with their spiritual ways and closeness to nature. However he is also under orders from the mercenaries to get information on the best way to destroy the native camp if necessary. He has a moral dilemma. You know which way that will go and there is a big battle in the end.So the visuals are excellent. You will definitely enjoy the ride! The cast are very much secondary to the special effects though Stephen Lang is brilliantly over the top as the macho head of the mercenaries. However the story borrows too much from the likes of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Transformers"" to make it a truly satisfying cinema experience that will remain with you.",positive
952,"I'm not wont to assign a perfect score to a film, but this is one that deserves it. I've seen it four times now, and it remains a brilliant jewel of a movie. How often does a film reduce a cynical, angry adult man to a state of childlike wonder? There is nothing to criticize in this film. It is pure entertainment, a work of art. It is interesting, intelligent, fast-paced, action-filled, beautiful and enchanting. The story itself is simple: a soldier goes native and saves the locals and their world from destruction from his own kind. This story has been told before (surely); however, it has never been told like this. However, the crucial fact is that the story is set in Pandora, the ultimate alien jungle paradise. Yes, this movie is all about Pandora. Thís planet and its denizens the Na'vi are portrayed in the film with astonishing technical skill, more like technical artistry. On top of all this, the movie has a profound message about, well, mystical environmentalism. Is that completely cool or what? Really, this is perhaps the best film ever made. Cameron is a god.",positive
953,"Hailed as a great technical achievement by introducing a new generation of stereoscopic cameras, Avatar changed the movie theater landscape. A couple of years later, it seems already somewhat dated in its use of 3D. Movies like Life of Pi have enhanced standards in 3D, offering a more total immersive experience than here, for example in reflection, depth and other visual effects.The worlds defined are beautiful and interesting. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore was correctly rewarded with an Academy Award, as was the production design. Some ideas in the movie are also fascinating and modeled on biology: neurons, synapses, sources, ecological diversity and the interconnected networks between all things alive and dead. See how in the end nature cooperates and triumphs over the next quarterly statement.Furthermore, the integration of several genres in one movie is an accomplishment in itself: war, adventure, science fiction and romance. Despite being a good overall idea, the further detailed script following is less intelligent and especially the lines itself are sometimes badly written, bordering even on the edge of being kitsch and laughable. The avatar idea is in itself great, but again needed more work in the script, just going in and out your avatar is too simple and the idea as a whole should have been further explored (introducing some welcome mythification in the story).The message is anti-war and pro nature, but to make that statement it needs the war movie format to keep us entertained. It also references Aliens (even Ripley has a new role), and in form and style there is too much overlapping. I hope they fix these problems in Avatar 2.",neutral
954,"yet another Hollywood CGI moneymaker. How could this garbage cost 200million dollars? there are no actor's, and i think the writers are retarded, seriously they are mining a rare metal called Unobtainium, that's what they come opp with! the storyline is simplistic and extremely boring. some hippi BS about evil companies raping the land. And the visual effect are extremely fake, it basically looks like they are cartoon aliens. Getting extremely feed up with the CGI crap i general. This must be the most over-hyped movie ever made. a piece of polished,clean CGI crap. In 5 years nobody will even remember it existed. Masterpiece my ass.",negative
955,"So why do i love Avatar so much? Because it is great step forward in movie-making, and it's as campy as any film I've ever seen. It is very expensive looking, very entertainment, amazing, fantastic, awesome, beautiful and gorgeous. And I shocked how the actors played their parts very well. The movie had awesome effects, good actors and best writing stories. Now i just wait is this the same movie.",positive
956,"This is unlike any kind of adventure movie my eyes have ever seen in such a long time, the characters, the musical score for every scene, the story, the beauty of the landscapes of Pandora, the rich variety and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of Pandora, the ways and cultures and language of the natives of Pandora, everything about this movie I am beyond impressed and truly captivated by. Sam Worthington is by far my favorite actor in this movie along with his character Jake Sulley, just as he was a very inspiring actor in The Shack Sam Worthington once again makes an unbelievable mark in one of the greatest and most captivating movies you'll ever see. This movie may completely turn the head of the old show of Avatar: The Last Airbender in some ways, but even I would've seen that coming even though I never watched the show. If you haven't seen this movie yet then you're missing out on something extremely astonishing and completely wonderful, it may even just change your point of view on seeing Earth and its flora and fauna and how to love and respect all of it as well as the planet itself. Take it from someone who's a complete lover and admirer of all forms of life on both Pandora when it comes to this movie and Earth and all it has to offer in reality concerning plants and animals. Avatar will amaze and astonish you more than you think both on the ground and up in the sky, this I 100% guarantee!!!!!",positive
957,"The cinematography displayed in this movie was way head of it's time. I mean genuinely it was truly astounding. I am so eager to see James Cameron's next offering as he delivers the sequel ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", at the end of this year. Thirteen years later, is thirteen years too long. We're ready for ya James!",positive
958,"When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it's industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it's audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it's an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90's, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the ""Avatar Program"", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70's, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40's - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it's time.",positive
959,"Let me start out on a positive note : Avatar's CGI is ground-breaking. It's absolutely stunning and amazing. But that doesn't stop the rest of the movie from being completely mediocre.First of all there's the story-line. The concept of Pandorra, the Na'avi and unabtanium has some originality. After that, the story gets riddled with heaps of clichés. If you hadn't watched any trailer or read anything about the movie, and then watched the first 10 minutes, anyone with any brain activity whatsoever could have predicted the rest of the movie.The action sequences bring us nothing we haven't seen before. And none of the acting surmounts to anything more than decent. Not a single performance that made we think ""wow"".I can't believe how the movie's prettiness distracted so many people from the fact that Avatar is nothing but overrated mediocrity.",neutral

I love the Navi! I love Sigourney Weaver! & I really love the story, the beautiful, beautiful, story. I love Avatar! The final battle with Jake flying his banshee is insane! 9.5 outta 10!",positive
961,"My curiosity finally got the better of me and I went to see Avatar.First of all, that the Golden Globes saw fit to name it the best dramatic motion picture of 2009 is a bit much. Their objectivity must have clearly gotten swept away in all of the hype, and the the enormous and growing sea of box office dollars.That being said, there's no denying that visually, the film is an almost transcendent, stunning technical achievement. I've been to 3D movies in the past; Avatar distinguished itself in that it succeeds where other 3D films have not--rather than the method being a gimmick or a novelty, in Avatar it actually immerses you in the world that the film has created, for the most part. No argument that the visuals are brilliant, breathtaking, beautiful, and unlike anything that has ever been done.Nevertheless, someone else here on IMDb posed an excellent question. If not for those dazzling visuals, what would the film have that would distinguish it (in terms of plot, character development, acting, story)? I won't hesitate to admit that I was swept up into that story, and was cheering and clapping at times (I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen the film yet). And to my surprise, unlike some of the reviewers here, I did develop a strong affinity for some of the characters, though others were no more than cardboard cutout caricatures, designed for the audience to hate, but to think nothing more of. There were also a number of fallacies in both the plot and the pretense of the story (which have been pointed out elsewhere), but they were no worse than those of many films that I've otherwise enjoyed.I did have a heck of an enjoyable time watching the film, which I guess is the whole point.But I also had a heck of an enjoyable time watching any number of other action films that were low tech or no tech, but were just as absorbing, and that set my heart racing just as fast and sitting just as erect in my seat. Avatar and the genre of films to which it belongs (despite its unique technical features) are certainly not top-notch, absorbing and though-provoking drama, of the caliber of films like ""Revolutionary Road,"" or ""Sounder,"" and ""A Face In the Crowd,"" the last two of which I watched again on TCM the other day, or the very low tech ""Open Water,"" or the absolutely brilliant ""Requiem for a Dream, that was also recently on cable (no 3D or high-tech visual effects in those!). I don't think that Cameron makes any pretense of Avatar, or of any of his films, being in the latter category. I would imagine that that doesn't bother him in the least, given that this latest film of his will probably be the most financially successful in movie history.IMHO, the best special effect, by FAR, is the human condition. That can only be rendered by a strong story, and top notch acting. Any fancy effects and bells and whistles are only gravy.Avatar was a lot of bells and whistles and gravy; the story was, for the most part, extremely predictable. But I don't hold that against it in that Cameron told that familiar story in an innovative and different way. But the sole foundation of that innovation and difference is the 3D, the visuals, and the effects. About halfway through the movie though, I found that I had gotten used to them and the 3D, and was coming to take them for granted. It was not long after that that most of my ooohs and ahhhs were past me, and at times I had even nearly forgotten that I was watching a 3D film. By then, however, my interest was sustained in that the epic confrontation between the good and the evil sides (not much gray area there!) was gearing up, and I was definitely rooting for one of the sides--guess who?. Will Avatar completely change movie making (other than pushing the boundaries of the state of the art of movie special effects)? Is it the greatest, or one of the greatest films ever made? I note the swooning of many or most of the reviewers here, who are convinced of that. I suppose that would be true if one feels that dazzling technical effects and 3D and gigantic box office receipts alone are in and of themselves what the art of the motion picture is all about. I take exception to that, and could not disagree more. IMHO, Avatar was great fun, is a stunning technical achievement. But it's by no means the best movie that I've ever seen, or even one of the best--though it is indeed one of the best of its kind.The bottom line for me? Avatar is well worth seeing; it was a great experience. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I went. But one should take it for what it is.",positive
962,"To me it's appalling that there are people who dislike this movie. My only explanation is that people react at impulse against the huge publicity surrounding the movie's release. I refuse to think it's because of emptiness of heart.
This movie is one of the greatest masterpieces ever created, not only visually stunning, but the message is universal and the rendering intense. You are not only drawn into this fantastic universe, but you are also infused with a sense of guilt when you realize the movie is about you . Well the movie is a metaphor .
Still the Academy decided to give the award to a movie that praised war and destruction. Rather cynical, I think.",positive
963,"All the special effects money can buy cannot override a soulless script. It exemplifies why the French consider American films sophomoric and vacuous. The same story could be sold to a Saturday morning, cartoon show for the infantile. Maybe it was intended just for kids. The effects were great, but the sci-fi elements were mostly mere fantasy. Pandora is a moon-planet apparently in orbit around a Jupiter-like planet which can only mean substantial time in pitch black darkness. Didn't Cameron consult anyone knowledgeable in science? It looks pretty to the eye but it embarrasses reason. Since so much attention to detail was shown regarding the technology used to project the neurological soul to an avatar, why any less detail given to celestial mechanics?Nonetheless, the beginning scene depicting hyper-sleep technology almost caused a lost of bowel control, it was so awesome. A Man Called Horse is a far better story of whitey eventually recognizing the far, far, far, far, far nobler characteristics of indigenous people. Maybe Avatar is today's representation of that idea. If so, it sure cost a lot more to get the same idea across. The ceremonial dance by the natives reminded me of a MGM musical. About 2 hours into the film I closed my eyes for a short break.",positive
964,"Don't know if someone else has mentioned this, but even if someone has, it deserves many more mentions. Alan Dean Foster, sci-fi author, wrote a book in 1975 called Midworld, about a rain forest planet which is being exploited by an evil corporation. The natives live in a symbiotic relationship to their surroundings and live in a huge tree called the Home Tree. They communicate telepathically with animals. Seriously...Google it. There's way more similarities. Plus, Cameron has used Foster to write the novel version of his movie Aliens, so we know Cameron was familiar with Foster's work. James Cameron is a plagiarist and should give credit where credit is due. Plus his movie is a rip off of Dances With Wolves, and it looks like a CGI cartoon made by SyFy network. You suck Cameron!",negative

966,"So I watched Avatar starring Sam Worthington(Terminator Salvation) as Jake Sully a Cripple who was recruited by The RDA to Fill His dead brothers shoes. Also Starring Joel David Moore(Chuck) as Dr. Norm Spellman, Giovonni Ribisi(Gangster Squad) as Parker Selfridge a Corrupt Businessman for The RDA, Also starring Stephen Lang(Conan The Barbarian) as Col. Miles Quartich a Former Solidier and The films main Villain who thinks Pandora is a Hell Hole and That it is dangerous. Michelle Rodriguez(Matchete) as Trudy Chacon a very Spunky Pilot.

The was emotionally driven which made it so great also I really enjoyed the visuals amazing performances for also those who did the motion capture performances also I really enjoyed that there balance is the cycle of life one of the few Greenpeace film I enjoyed also I really dug it Science fiction aspect as well and to date The Na'Vi are most relatable Aliens who aren't Human but are Humanoid. Some of the aspects I didn't enjoy was the pervasive Language saying GD every time wasn't Needed also a sex scene between Jake & Neytiri was kinda awkward. spoiler I really Enjoyed the final Fight sequence Between The RDA & The Na'vi Clans it was exciting and One of the best next to To The Battle Of Yavin. Also I enjoyed Sully's and Quatritch Confrontation it was exciting also too see Jake to stand up for the Na'vi People even he was an ""Alien"" Spoiler . the amazing Direction From James Cameron(Terminator 2:Judgement Day), Great Musical Score from the Amazing James Horner(Troy) and Great Costume Design from Mayes C.Rubeo(Titanic) & Deborah Lynn Scott(Get Smart) Not as Awesome as Star Wars But definitely a Noteworthy Science Fiction film 8/10",positive
967,"Yes, The Day the Earth Stood Still (original) is still probably champ, but this film gives it a run for its money. I had thought James Cameron to be an egotistical meglomaniac when I saw him at the Academy Award ceremonies for Titantic, but I have changed my mind after Avatar. Cameron is a very good writer and director. His sets, special effects, makeup and production values for Avatar are unsurpassed. The acting crew, led by buffed-up Gary Sinese as an all-time heavy is more than competent. Sigorney Weaver, who does her impression of Margaret Mead, the famous anthropologist, does a very credible job as well. The sets are magnificent. As Issac Asimov once said, you can only write good science-fiction if you are able to create a believable environment that surrounds your story. Well, Cameron accomplished that; to his credit. Philosophically, however, the film is much deeper than the eye candy that we behold for almost two hours. Ultimately, this film is a tragedy or triumph, depending on your life view. Man vs. Science and Nature is an eternal struggle. It appears as if Nature wins this one, but there is plenty of precedent for Nature getting clobbered by Science and Man in the history of Mankind. The American Indian, who should have slaughtered the first settlers of the American continent made a fatal mistake and allowed them to live alongside them. Ultimately, these invaders destroyed the American Indian and its culture. The same could be said for ancient man; evolution generally wipes out any previous edition that has basic flaws. But is that nature or science?
There were sequences in the film that were reminiscent of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, The Last Samurai, Star Wars, Mutiny on the Bounty, and Full Metal Jacket. An animated film, Forbidden Planet, also came to mind. The Vietnam War (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Go Tell the Spartans) also had parallels. The Iraq occupation has parallels. Haleburton, anyone? There are political considerations. Conservative hard-liners might favor the colonists. Liberals would naturally tend to favor the natives. But Nature has no political alliance. Nature overcomes all political and religious beliefs. There is no need to go any further than Deep Impact to realize that scenario (the bad one, not the lucky one). Or Sunshine (once again, bad scenario, not the lucky one). Science and man are always destined to lose to nature the vast majority of times. Occasionally, science and man wins, but those wins are only temporary. Nature always wins in the end.",positive
968,"Newspaper resident right-wing spleen merchants have written this movie off as a product of James Cameron's hippie sensibilities (Nature good, Civilisation bad) but the plot is so ordinary it is not likely to have much persuasive value. Visually it is something else. With Planet Pandora (technically a moon), Cameron, inspired by the Amazonian rain forest and Jurassic Park, not only has created a 3-D world of beauty and splendour, he has staged some truly spectacular action sequences, particularly in the air (Harry Potter and his flying broomsticks on steroids). The average viewer is going to be swept away by this, not by the clunky plot, which revolves around a mining venture on a distant planet being obstructed by the locals who are justifiably upset by the intrusion.What upsets the Right's cheer brigade is the ""simplistic"" portrayal of the military as moronic thugs, when we have all those brave men and women out there defending freedom and our oil supplies price in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since this is a science fiction fable the analogy is likely to be lost on most viewers – they are more likely to see it as a steal from ""GI Joe""). As Jake Sully, the central character who changes sides in the battle, Sam Worthington is not a traitor to his race, as the cartoonish Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) calls him, but someone who realises that what is being done to the planet and its people in the quest for ""unobatinium"" is morally unjustified. Perhaps our columnists would like to take a look at what has been done to the environment and population by mining in New Guinea, for example.Leaving aside the politics, Sam Worthington has just the presence for his part. It was nice to see Sigorney Weaver, an old hand in Cameron movies, back as the crusty but likable scientist Dr Grace. I also liked Giovanni Ribisi as Selfridge the mine manager once I realized he wasn't Jerry Seinfeld. He was the epitome of the corporate shyster. The unsung heroes of all this are the animation and special effects people , hundreds of them including Weta of NZ, who have put their experience in Lord of the Rings to good use.To revert to the political, we might ask why there is an apparent ""left wing"" bias in Hollywood movies. The answer of course is that the Right have no imagination, a vital attribute for a successful innovative movie maker. Cameron might write clunky plots and corny dialogue, but there's nothing wrong with his visual imagination, and he has the ability to engage the primal fears of his audience, if not their intellects, and to entertain.",positive
969,"Firstly let me state that Avatar is not as 'bad' a film as some people make it out to be. That said neither is it a good film. Avatar is a leap forward in graphics but sadly not in any other area. The CGI is spectacular CGI. It does not create realism however, it creates a very good CGI world. What I am saying here is that you are constantly aware of the CGI environment and, sorry if I sound old fashioned here, but isn't suspension of disbelief a fundamental part of cinema viewing? the charm and unique nature of Avatar is its technology and you must accept that this film for what it is before condemning or praising it too hard. Take out the clever CGI (which time and familiarity will do as it does with all effects based films) and you are left with a rather preachy movie that has some very juvenile and often clunky dialogue. The 'we are all one with our planet' message is rammed down our throats so much that I began to feel preached at by a giant smurf, and as I watching it in 3D he kept leaning into my popcorn to do it. Don't expect too much, accept Avatar as a glorified Saturday morning keep the kids quiet film and it works just fine.",neutral
970,"Ah, yes, the greatest film ever made - according to box office takings, at least. Love it or hate it, there is no denying this is pure brilliance! The grand scale of the entire production is simply mind blowing. The effects are unlike anything we've ever seen and is quite mesmerizing, actually. Action, adventure, humor, drama, exhilarating action sequences and a world full of magic and color ensure entertainment deluxe. Add a brilliant cast and a credible hero in the form of Sam Worthington and I can easily see why this film became the highest earning film in movie history. The tranquility of the Avatar world gives us a sense of escapism and makes us wish we ourselves could plunge into this world of pure bliss and perfection. Our hero goes from paraplegic in the real world to a perfect being in the Avatar world, so why wouldn't we also want to escape into this awesome world?The destruction of the Big Tree must be one of the most awesome scenes!!",positive
971,"The visual effects are impressive and ground breaking, but the story is ho hum. Scout goes native after immersion in their ways - leading to the ultimate conflict of loyalties and rebellion from father figure. Etc.Also, the big, ""I Luv You This Much"" eyes of the Nav'i, oi.But overall, as with previous Cameron outings starting with Terminator, the details are very well coordinated and plausible. The low gravity and the magnetic flux fields etc. explain/account for a lot of weirdness (giant size creatures, floating rocks, etc.).The only disconnect is at the end - no explanation of why kicking the current crop of humans off the planet would avoid their return in force. If the Unobtainium was so precious/vital/rare, then one would expect it would not be given up that easy. Some kind of explanation of a negotiated agreement would have been good.Sequel opening, mayhaps? Nav'i learn human technology just in time to repel return attack? As with all technical advances, this virtual world technology will need a much stronger story to really show it's power.",positive
972,"I sometimes can't understand why so many thought Avatar was less than amazing. I do understand that people have differing views, but darn! Sure, the plot has some vague similarities to other movies, but how can anyone say they were ""stolen"" plots? Every ""great"" movie I ever saw had similarities in both emotional presentation and character development. Oh well, to each their own view...mine is that Avatar deserves nothing less than a 10, both in creativity and delivery.i know I was mesmerized from the start, and quite frankly didn't realize that three hours had past. I can't wait for the promised sequel, thank you James!",positive
973,"Why on earth don't they spend more time on the spot rather than spending more money on the movie? The end is so obvious from the beginning. Graceful tree-hugging Na'vis vs. greedy human-beings. So beyond LOTR or Matrix even though how much hi-tech is involved. What a waste of fiscal sources invested in! I respect the endeavor. But I didn't like it. It was the most emotional and educational video game I've ever seen. Promotion - Marketing - Trade. Mr. Cameron is richer than yesterday, since he taught us a good lesson? I was expecting a good plot, but all I got was strong visuals. It is not enough. At least, the film doesn't deserve the praises it got. When the praises were so overstated, my expectations got higher. Overinflated balloon popped. Characters imitated from Matrix or LOTR. Sully is so like Neo, rebellious, ignorant at first, then he crosses the good side and falls in love. An oracle who reads the marks. ""Elf""ish kingdom; they respect the nature, they are noble and they are supernatural. Oh please. It's lacking the originality on every plane. Before the movie, there was a huge sequence of commercials. Some of them were about Wii games. I find them more original in terms of technology.",neutral
974,"This movie has already been made, it's called Dances With Wolves. Think about the two movies and you will know what I am talking about. It's also way to computer generated for me, it looks fake and stupid. It reminds me of Star Wars 1-3. The Cameron magic failed in this lame movie. There was really nothing about this movie that I liked except that Sigourney Weaver was in it.",negative

976,"Avatar is one of the best cinematic experiences we've ever had so far – and, as regular cinema goers, we've had a lot of very good ones! It is an incredible movie with amazing visuals – try to see it in an IMAX cinema if you can, at least once, (even if you have already seen it in a regular cinema) to get the full effect! (BFI IMAX at Waterloo in London has extended the screenings of Avatar now until 10 July 2010. See their Website for details and to book.) My son and I went to see Avatar at the British Film Institute (BFI) IMAX at Waterloo, here in London in January as a delayed Christmas treat, and we have been back since! It is truly, breathtakingly, awesome! A great film to see on any cinema screen - the CGI is out of this world - but imagine it filling a screen more than 20 metres high (That's nearly the height of five double-decker buses stacked on top of each other!) and 26 metres wide. With 11,600-watts of digital surround-sound and the most sophisticated motion-picture projection system in the world – we literally felt like we were 'in the picture'! The story line, although transposed to another location, is very poignant and relevant to our times, and a warning to us today, as well as for the future. It evolves with sensitivity as the main protagonists' backgrounds are revealed, as they come to terms with the changing circumstances situations, and as the plot moved towards its conclusion.A heartfelt thanks to all involved in the making of truly remarkable movie: we love it! And I'm sure that you will enjoy it too, and be uplifted! - And also be profoundly moved, and left with plenty to think about too, maybe even taking some positive actions as a consequence of what you have learnt, or because of what you have become more acutely aware of.",positive
977,"The visual effects in this movie are unseen and bombastic. After a wile you loose this feeling of ""it is just a movie"". You are immersed in the movie and you are exploring a new world. It is more than one time that you loose your breath. Beautiful images are following each other at high speed and you just can't believe what you are seeing.The story is a bit thin and predictable though there are nice character developments. But that just doesn't matter because Avatar is just more than a movie, more than a true masterpiece, it is a lifetime experience, a movie that writes film history.You have too see it in 3D, better IMAX, because the 3D images are a vital part of the movie and it is the way James Cameron intended it.",positive
978,"So what do I mean when I say I eat my words? Well it annoyed me that the fact that James Cameron was the sole reason to see Avatar. Yes he's a renowned director but I don't even consider him in the same league as a Spielberg or a Scorcese (not that I am a huge fan of Scorcese personally.) I didn't quite understand the ""visionary"" everyone thought he was. Yes he's done some solid action/sci-fi flicks and yes he managed to direct Titanic to record breaking greatness but was this enough to base Avatar solely on? Well I miss the Titanic of boats because James Cameron's decade long labor of love might be at the very least one of the great film epics ever made. Hands down if nothing else Avatar is the most visually stunning piece of film you will ever see (and I didn't see it in 3D YET.) As many have said the CGI in the film which is practically 99% of the entire film is nearly flawless and the work put into the Na'vi people especially the main characters is just amazing. Add in the fact that there are some genuinely incredible performances and an entire world built from the ground up and sci-fi lovers will be floored this creation. It still won't be the type of film to reach out to all genres but it is quite possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.Sam Worthington is quickly becoming someone to watch for in Hollywood. He leads the cast in Avatar with skill and a brooding personality. Unfortunately for him Worthington is not the strongest in this cast. He does well and yet his character doesn't have nearly the depth of some of the others. Still this should do amazing things for his future. Zoe Saldana on the other hand is mind blowingly brilliant. She gives the performance of her career and does it all behind the shadow of a CGI character proving that talent and brilliance can shine through even in voice and computer capture. Her character shows so much incredible emotion and is so brilliant, she should be given an Oscar just for those merits alone. She is stunning. Sigourney Weaver slips back into sci-fi brilliance as Dr. Grace Augustine. She goes through a range of personality changes but is definitely a character you can feel empathy for. Yes she also smokes in the movie...please get over it. It's a character flaw, millions smoke. And just as a side note this woman who is a lovely FIFTY NINE YEARS OLD...looks incredible. Stephen Lang gives us a performance that just may be one of the great film villains of all time. First of all he simply looks bad ass. Second of all he gives a strong, surly, performance that admittedly is a little two dimensional (get the irony) he serves his purpose as evil villain and pulls it off amazingly. Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi (amazing cameo role), Joel Moore (great character actor) and the entire cast that play the supporting Na'Vi characters are all brilliant in their own way. Some stand out more than others but the entire cast comes together perfectly.I just always though director and writer James Cameron had a run of good luck with Titanic and his earlier works in Aliens and True Lies and creating the Terminator world. But when you look at his body of work he's never done a bad movie. The man knows science fiction and Avatar has really been his thesis, his ultimate show and he accomplished it in a big way. Maybe I'm over hyping the film but it's just been a really long time since I was riveted to my seat, transported like this film did for me in the theater, make me want to see it again the moment the credits wrapped. If you are one of the people who has not contributed to the 1.4 billion dollar take I suggest you get out there and add to it because this film deserves to be #1 film of all time. I can't go right out there and say my favorite of all time yet but top five at the very least. Let's face it Titanic was your Grandma's movie...this one is for us. You are King of The World Mr. Cameron...the world and Pandora. 10/10 and then someADDITION---February 5th/2010 I had the pleasure of seeing Avatar for a second time and saw it in 3D. Was it impressive? Yes. The technology is very impressive and looks cool. Did it change the entire face of the movie? Sorry folks...it didn't for me. The movie is incredible but its incredible because its Avatar, not because of the 3D. I'm glad I saw it and it was on an IMAX screen so it was explosively cool but the movie is great on its own and gains very very little in 3D except a lot of depth.",positive
979,"The movie follows a familiar James Cameron formula. Here are the similarities to ""Aliens"":1. Sigourney Weaver is a tough, no-nonsense science gal with a warm heart beneath that gruff exterior 2. After centuries of technological advance, earth culture has not changed one iota and Marines are still jarheads 3. Corporations are evil 4. Aliens are always larger than humans, who fight them using mechanized exoskeletonsHere are the differences:1. Instead of being slimy and creepy, the aliens and their planet are gorgeous and iridescent, with lots of vintage Peter Max psychedelia 2. Instead of being malevolent killing machines, the aliens are stuffed to the gills with Tim Leary/Gregory Bateson hippy-dippy New Age environmental consciousness, and they have adopted Native American fashion trends circa 1800. However, they still hiss when they are about to attack",positive
980,"I apologise to each and every one of you 'Avatards', as the haters call you...us.I was one of those haters. You may even say, a bit of a ""troll"" about it, depending on what you define as a troll.I know there are plenty of people on the boards that have run into me before, and we've been nasty at each other.I was a real Nazi of a hater, more so than most haters. I was a hated, hating hater of a hater. You know what I'm saying? But tonight motion pictures just changed.It opened up my eyes, the kind of stuff only the original King Kong, The Wizard of Oz, and The Creature From The Black Lagoon have done to people and motion pictures in general before. Just four or five of them are the equivalents, but we had none of them this century.Now we do.I was crying the whole way home - and I don't cry easily. I'm quite a bit of a ""tough sonofabitch"", if you will.But I kept having flashes, of the first motion picture being made, the first movie camera being manufactured...a little stroll in the garden life as we know it...some funny Frenchman taking people to the moon...Merian C. Cooper dreaming of ""KONG""... Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tinman and the Cowardly Lion arm in arm skipping across the yellow brick road singing to the Emerald City...people in line to see a little film about a fish-man and the lagoon he calls home, raising their eyebrows at these funny little red and blue glasses they were being told to put on...Tobe Hooper as a little boy, first seeing his daddy using a chainsaw...John Carpenter unleashing The Shape to change America's impression of the seemingly happy little holiday called 'Halloween'...Spielberg bringing dinosaurs back from extinction...And it hit me like lightning: Motion pictures could easily be every answer to any question asked throughout all time. It could be such technology rooted off movies in general, Avatar's 3D being it's major fuel, to make the blind see...to get two screens, like glasses, and have them surgically inserted behind the eyes, to replace the eyes. And such and such.One gripe: We only just got an LCD TV, now that's just not good enough.I WANT A 3D TV! Hehe!",positive
981,"Avatar. I have to admit, I was excited to watch it what with it being a James Cameron production and the acclaim that its had world-wide. I can admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the Titanic when I watched it all those years ago, and even cried at the end. I found the story real and compelling, and the hint of a twist at the end a charming way to end a well-executed romantic tale - and all of this is coming from a cynic.So I had high hopes when I went to watch Avatar. I won't say that I was disappointed - I found the movie engaging enough, and the special effects were pretty damn amazing.But I'm a story person, and I found the story entirely too predictable and methodological. Perhaps I had set high expectations for the movie - I expected to be leaving the cinema perhaps contemplating life and humanity and marveling at the creative genius of the screenplay, but instead I left feeling like I'd watched 2 hours of a Disney movie on steroids.Don't get me wrong - I love Disney movies and own many of them, but a Disney formula was the last thing I was expecting when I went to watch Avatar. Yes, it had strong messages about humanity and nature, but for me, they weren't necessary inspiring messages. I found the characters had no depth, and the storyline was entirely predictable and left no room for imagination or surprise - there was no magic. I found Jake Scully's character unspectacular, particularly when compared to the recent Disctrict 9 which dealt with similar themes. With Wikus, I could relate - there's something to be said when a hero emerges from an ordinary man. In contrast, Jake Scully was like fluff. I felt that I could even compare this protagnoist with Neo in The Matrix - when he emerged a hero it was a turning point in the movie as the Matrix revealed it self to him. When Jake Scully did, it was expected - we all knew he was going to ride Toruk because it had been nicely set up with the legend of Toruk Makto, in the same way that we knew that he would end up living as a Na'vi because that too was nicely foreshadowed by Grace's death.I guess the story of a paraplegic marine officer who gets a second chance at life with a woman he loves in a world where everything is the right way is the very notion of textbook romantic, and I can see how the movie would appeal. But to me, it felt like a potentially good story line had been compromised for the use of amazing special effects. Eventually, the wow of the effects fade, and it is the story you remember. For me, that will not be the case with Avatar.",positive
982,"I'm afraid that my viewpoint on this film will not be from a technical standpoint with references to other great films, actors or directors. I can only speak with the voice of one who has walked this Earth for over half a century and after listening to Democrats and Republicans for most of that time I have seen that both sides to any argument can document their ideas to the nth degree. This film was designed to provoke an emotional response from start to finish and it does so to a degree I have not experienced before. The writing, the acting, the CG panorama and the technical excellence of the 3D all combine to make this story the new benchmark in film entertainment. Kudos to Mr. Cameron and the whole team for shocking this old man to tears.Plus the fact that Ms. Weaver is so gorgeous, doesn't hurt at all...",positive

984,"I heard that Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot. Really? That long? It's a shame that after spending all that money on the very pretty CGI they didn't have anything left to spend on a plot or a proper story or any characters that were anything more than cartoon cut-outs.So the Americans (yes, you know they are) go to another strange land to rob it of its mineral wealth and they first have to get the natives to move out of the way. The natives use bows and arrows, paint their faces and have great respect for the forces of nature. It's another modern ""Western"" straight out of the ""Dances With Wolves"" school.The hero is straight out of ""John Carter of Mars"" (the books, not the terrible film), the heroine is Pocahontas, but with more flesh exposed - even if it is blue - to keep the adult males happy. The baddies are all super-evil psychotics without a single redeeming feature.What a waste of time and talent",negative
985,"James Cameron is a storied director whose films have been landmarks of their time. Like he did in the '80s and '90s with both Terminator films, he returns from his 10-year hiatus without missing a beat, shepherding audiences into the future of cinema with progressive film-making done with the most advanced technology. ""Avatar"" is a miraculous visual feat, the greatest epic since ""The Lord of the Rings"" and a film-making milestone unlike any other. At the conclusion of a decade, it's a window into what audiences of the future can expect at the movies.There really is no film ""Avatar"" can be compared to other than ""Star Wars"" because of the science-fiction originality. The world of Pandora and Na'vi all come from Cameron's head as did the Star Wars universe from that of George Lucas. Although ""Star Wars"" is a much wider and complex universe, ""Avatar's"" world is still incredibly imaginative and awesome. Spectacle is ""Avatar's"" greatest asset and Cameron utilizes it completely, bringing our attention to all the tightest details. The multitude of creatures inhabiting Pandora and the remarkably life- like Na'vi captivate almost entirely on looks alone.The story of ""Avatar"" uses classic archetypes that while not entirely original best serve the purposes of the film. Jake Sully (up-and-coming Aussie Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic ex-marine given a second chance by filling in for his brother on an operation on the planet Pandora. He becomes part of the Avatar program, which allows humans to enter artificially created Na'vi (the humanoid blue cat-like natives) versions of themselves. Sully's mission is to get to better know the Na'vi and their culture from the inside, but Col. Quatrich (Stephen Lang) convinces him to divulge intel should the Na'vi not be willing to abandon their home so the humans can force their way to a rare and valuable resource called unobtainium located there.Naturally, Jake gets very close to the Na'vi tribe, who teaches him the Na'vi way of life. He becomes attached to their ""princess"" Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who takes him through rites of passage, explaining how the Na'vi are connected with the planet and all living things on it in the figurative and literal sense. We're introduced to a world unlike anything we've seen before. Predictably, the Na'vi and humans are destined for a fatal showdown and Jake's change of heart will make him the controversial key to its end.Cameron's script is very socially driven. Using terms like ""fighting terror with terror"" and ""shock and awe,"" it's blatantly critical of America and completely unforgiving of the human race. You'll come out of ""Avatar"" thinking how awful we are and how Cameron assigns us no redeeming qualities other than the few characters that decide the oppression of the Na'vi is wrong. It does, however, effectively sway our emotions. The most riveting concept in the film is that although Jake becomes ""one of them,"" his actual self is in a machine and any tampering with it brings him back to his handicapped human self. In this way ""Avatar"" is one- of-a-kind in terms of story.In classic Cameron fashion, ""Avatar"" is incredibly long, but with the motion-capture CGI and 3D (and you must see it 3D to experience the scope), it's completely justified. Parts do drag and feel unrealistic or excessive at times, but the sheer magnitude of the movie and its visual prowess are plenty of an excuse to go a tad over-the-top.Some other impressive food-for-thought about this movie is how humans are not only the enemy but they're not integral to the film. Never before has a live-action movie not needed to rely on human characters. The motion-capture and the subtle human qualities of Na'vi are good enough to carry the film. Other producers might've sought to counter that with big- name actors, but Cameron (like in his other films) refuses. This insanely expensive project not only benefited from saving that cash, but is testament to Cameron's storytelling ability.""Avatar"" is simply an experience -- a ground-breaking and truly miraculous endeavor from the mind of cinema's most forward-thinking filmmaker. It's one of those rare achievements where flaws are so easily forgiven because of sheer innovation and imagination. See this film and experience a new dawn in movie history.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com",positive
986,"After 12 years with his success with Titanic, the great action director James Cameron is back with the long-waited Avatar. Avatar is the most expensive film ever made, a possible revolution in cinema technology and 3D, and a massive gamble for Fox studios who under Tom Rothman have become the laughing stock of Hollywood (Rothman himself is still derided and hated though). There was a lot of hype surrounding the film, and some feared that it would underwhelm audience, but luckily it didn't.On the moon planet Pandora, the RDA corporation is trying to mine the planet for unobtainium, the most valuable resource known to man. The Na'vi tribes people, a tall, blue skinned, nature loving, cat like people, live on the abundant source of it. The Company is willing to use military force, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a tough military man. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), a scientist wants to study the people and wildlife, and wants to use diplomacy to convince the Na'vi to move to a different site. She wants to win hearts and minds by educating the Na'vi. Here Jake Scully (Sam Worthington), a disabled former Marine, steps in. His twin brother had died, but he is a biological match to his Avatar, a genetically created Na'vi which human being could transfer their minds in. On a scientific mission Jake gets separated from the team and ends up meeting a native Na'vi, Neytiri (Zoë Saldaña). He joins the tribe, starts to learn their ways, their love and link to nature and starts to fall for Neytiri. But Jake is stuck in a three way conflict between the military (who he promises to give them intelligence), the scientists who want to study the planet and befriend the Na'vi, and the Na'vi themselves which he gains their trust, and where his loyalties belongs.The story is nothing too original, their are elements of films like Lawrence of Arabia and The Last Samurai where an outside becomes a member of close knit tribe, the Matrix with the idea of transferring your mind into another body and allows you to do extraordinary things and the Alien series where a company is responsible for aggressive action. The story and theme of colonisation in the film was properly influenced by America's actions in the Wild West against Native Americans, but to me it reminded me of the East India Company and colonisation in Africa where forming colonies was influenced by private business, not government action. James Cameron is an excellent writer and crafts a lot of different ideas and plot in an brilliant film. There are a lot of factions and themes which are well told and Cameron follows his old ideas of character development. His classics like the Terminator and Aliens were great because of the characters, not just the action. All the characters are interesting, my personal favourite was Neytiri but all were given a chance to shine. As well as the theme of colonisation, the Vietnam and Iraq wars much have influenced Cameron. Iraq because of a military invasion of a foreign people for a valuable resource, and because of Vietnam and Iraq because a technological superior force is outnumbered and in a foreign climate. The last theme is the idea of technology against nature and the balance of live. The Na'vi are linked to nature and it's a part of their culture and religion, whilst the humans just destroy nature without a care. A commentary about Global Warning in today's world? Cameron is follow the Gaia hypothesis where the world is a living being with everything being interlinked.What James Cameron is truly great at is action, and of course action is some of the best ever put to screen. As an action film by itself Avatar is the best of 2009 (though District 9 and Inglorious Basterds were very good). You actually get to see the action, the camera follows it, not shaking about or too close so you can't see anything. It is well edited and just a join to watch compared to some modern action films. Cameron transfers you to another world. He creates a beautiful world with wonderful designs, and with great creature designs as well. It reminds me of King Kong (both the 1933 and 2005 versions). Cameron did put a lot of thought into the history and culture of the Na'vi as well. The CGI is fantastic and the 3D is brilliant. It was so well done that it added depth to the film, giving it a more hands on feel. However I think 3D life Avatar are going to be few and far between, with 3D mostly being the reserve of animated films and B-Movie horror.There is a good cast, that goes without saying. Zoë Saldaña, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver are of particular note of praise. Sigourney Weaver almost reminded of her role as Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist. Sam Worthington is clearly a star in the making, having stole the show in Terminator Salvation and now having the lead role in Avatar, I am looking forward to Clash of the Titans next year. It's also good to see Michelle Rodriguez career back on track.There are some criticism of the film. First it's a bit too long, with a running time over two and half hours, and there are elements that could have been cut or shorten. Some of the dialogue was weak, and at times stated the obvious. I think Cameron was trying to come up with some more classic one-lines. And finally, as stated, some ideas and story elements were copied from other films.Worth watching, and one of the most fun films I seen in the cinema for a whilst.",positive
987,"A lot of hype has been building up around ""Avatar"", James Cameron's return behind the camera, so, without question, I was there opening night! Luckily, in my country, the movie was released one day earlier than US. (Since movies are released here on Thursdays, not Fridays.)In short, Avatar has got to be my favorite movie experience ever which I can't wait to experience again and again.I'll drewl over the awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping visuals later on, but now let's focus abit on the plot, shall we? In several critics' reviews, I noticed that they mentioned the movie lacked depth. I disagree. (I'll try my best to keep this review spoiler-free.) It's future Earth, and the plot revolves around Jake Sully, a marine who lost the ability to walk. He is sent to replace his recently dead brother on a mission that involves him flying over to Pandorum ,which is inhabited by the indigenous population called the Na'vi, in an avatar body, a human mind in an alien body. Through a chain of events, he meets Neiriti (did I write that correctly?, well who cares?) who for a certain reason (which I shall NOT spoil) decides to help him learn their culture and ways, only to find himself torn between two worlds. (Abit ""Dances with Wolves""-ish, eh?). Humans are in desperate need for natural resources which this world provides, but there's a scared bond (religion) between the population there and the nature.In my opinion, James Cameron brilliantly wrote Jake Sully. He made him 3-dimensional (no, not with those glasses). You're rooting for him. He also focused on Neiriti which I will even go ahead and said looked sexy!My only issue is that the movie has several cheesy lines and moments. (But, I mean, check out Titanic for crying out loud. Cheesy but with 600 million $ in the bank.) He created an entirely new world, creatures, a language (fan boys, brace yourselves!), and a religion! The religion really interested me! (Being a committed catholic myself, couldn't help but find it delicious.) Now I come to the visuals, and what gorgeous effects they are!This will change cinema as we know it!I'm speechless actually! The 3D glasses are not used for pointless being thrown at you, but so that you become immersed in this stunning world! As I left the theater, I felt like I was leaving Pandorum and coming back home!WOW! You must see this! Missing it out is a crime in my opinion! The 3 hours fly by instantly!Everything looks so real! Even the Na'vi, once you get used to the fact that thy're big and blue, are stunning. The attention to details is ""fantabulous"".The colors, the plants, the creatures all tell you one thing; ""Sit Back , and ENJOY!"" Avatar is an event! You do not want to miss it! I can't wait to see it again! The stunning effects and the plot (oh and let's not forget the cast, especially Sam Worthington!!! )will take to another world! Avatar is the new King Kong on top the Empire state Building, the new castle in Oz, the new King of the World!",positive
988,"I must say that even though i really wanted to watch this movie,i still expected it to suck!I think that in these days,big budget movies are usually being eaten by great visuals.By that i mean that visuals oftenly distract you from holes in the script.And i can't say that,that's not the question with this movie too.Avatar is definitely not a movie that shows us something new in the way of storytelling or even the general idea!It's pretty obvious that it's been highly influenced by such movies as Dances With Wolves!To be completely honest,the only thing that's flawless in this movie are visuals!And they are so,so great.Especially in 3-D.But still,i really can't find a reason that would make me hate this movie.Maybe that's because i didn't expect it to be as good as James Cameron said it will be,i don't know.Avatar is a very interesting and tense movie with a predictable plot and bad character development!And even though i gave it nine,i still must admit that it DOESN'T DESERVE IT.At least not for what was said it will be because if you judge it by that,you will definitely be disappointed.It's a classic story with a classic ending and everything else except for the revolutionary visuals!But it's still very,very enjoyable to watch.And even though the characters were very shallow in a way that they're not complexed enough or maybe even at all,they're still quiet lovely and interesting and you will definitely care for them.Just as for the entire Na'vi civilization which is pretty well described in the movie but also obviously influenced by the native Americans or should i say indians!I can find a large number of mistakes that this movie has.I can also name at least ten movies that obviously influenced James Cameron to make this one.But i wont.Instead i'm just gonna take it for what it is and enjoy it's thousand times already seen but still beautiful story!This movie is definitely my recommendation to everyone.Just don't expect it to be what James Cameron said it will be because you might and probably will be disappointed.Except for the visuals!",positive
989,"A HUGE disappointment! I don't like going to the cinemas and wasting fifteen dollars on one movie but Avatar seemed to me like a movie the would blow me away completely and probably earn a straight ten from me. So, how can this ""masterpiece"" be a complete failure, in my professional opinion, and better yet why is it in the top 250? It has got so much attention for like two months and it is getting even more famous over the last couple days but it does not mean this is the best movie in the world. Who cares if it has gotten 8.8 on IMDb or if it has broken the all time box office record but in the end you have to ask yourself: ""Was it really worth it?"". And for me, sadly, it was not what I expected, I was petrified that it descended down my ladder more quickly than Epic Movie, and the first-half seemed to me like the movie was wasted. The 3-D was not cool and the glasses hurt my nose, it hurt so much that I had to take them of repeatedly just to massage my nose and was I thankful for that. Sure, Avatar looks visually great, it may have the best graphics in a film ever, and it really makes the movie worthwhile but you have to give all the credit to the money. Without it Avatar could suck my brass balls! Please disregard that last comment! Thank you. James Cameron has directed my favorite action film of all time, Terminator 2, and for that I am eternally grateful but Avatar hypnotizes people into thinking that it has the best story ever when it doesn't. The graphics and the world of Pandora just cover up how sh*t the story really is. Just to put it straight, James Cameron has disappointed me......a lot! A respected and a well known director making a film about blue people is hilarious especially if they are called the Na'Avi. The film starts out slow and boring, no action, no laughs, just plain slowness and it surprisingly remains like that for an hour and a half but paces up in the rest of the remaining time. I really expected more from this film! Sigourney Weaver gave the performance of a hard-a$$ scientist who, obviously, starts to develop emotions in the end but it was so sad to see that it didn't leave a good impression on Avatar. Sam Worthington did really good in playing the wheelchair bound Jake Sully who takes up the role of being a Na'Avi and it is when he is a Na'Avi, he gives a good and strong performance. Stephen Lang who plays the f...ed up Marine was a walking cliché because in every eye candy the mean guy has to be strong and fearless and Stephen delivered that right on the mark. Zoe Saldana did pretty good in playing a Na'Avi but her accent immediately gives her away. Giovanni Ribisi was my favorite actor in the film for many simple reasons, he was funny, cool sort of guy, and he offered the kind of personality which made him unique from the rest of the bums.(May Contain Some Spoilers!!!) In the year 2154, Jake Sully, a wheelchair bound guy, arrives on the planet Pandora and he immediately realizes that he is not in Kansas anymore. First of all a war is raging on between the humans and the Na'Avi over a precious material which is buried in the blue peoples sacred ground. Second of all, he realizes that technology has somewhat evolved and transformer-type war machines along with a few more weapons have given the humans advantage to unleash hell on Pandora. He signs up for the Avatar program and expects the unexpected. He can suddenly walk again and with his new advantage he does a bit of ""searching around"". He meets a girl (Zoe Saldana)and after getting used to the blue parasites lifestyle, he starts developing feelings for them.(Spoilers from hereon in!!)The world Pandora is amazing and you should see the movie just for that. The floating mountains and its weird inhabitants are mysterious and interesting. The horse-looking things look very realistic along with the flying things but it all sums up to fun. The soundtrack and music are the best I have heard in a long time in a movie because it gets wilder and adds more coolness when there is a big battle, like at the end. The battles were great since here weren't any boring action scenes and the film gets interesting after a battle. A lot more. If i could choose to watch Avatar again, I would happily decline since what I am doing right now. There are lots of styles in an action scene from fighting with bow and arrows to fighting with guns to using your body, this film really does contain ACTION. The film is too long and a few unnecessary scenes should be cut from the film because they don't offer anything except time wasting. Anyone who likes action, good music, big fights, weird rituals, and crazy scenery should definitely watch this movie because they will be blown away. The rest of them would find it long, boring, slow, dramatic, time wasting, ball-sucking, sh*tty acting, money wasting, sh*t tasting, sleep-making, rubbish, dumb, hilarious, retarded, bad graphics, and unnecessary.Story - 6.5 Action - 7.5 Special effects - 9.0 Graphics - 7 Soundtrack - 9.0 Total - 7/10 - Could have been better!",neutral
990,"There are films, and then there are movies. I am not going to be technical here in my definitions, I'm just going to speak from how I feel the difference is between the two words. A film is a piece of work that might be artistically engaging, but is just meh, whereas a movie is all that and a bag of chips. A movie is something that sweeps you away into its world and keeps you riveted to your seat till the credits roll. James Cameron's Avatar is a movie in the best sense of the word.Avatar has been in production for nearly fourteen years, and it shows in the world in which James Cameron has created. The world is Pandora, an alien moon covered in lush rainforests inhabited by wild alien creatures of astounding design, and an indigenous race of 10 ft. tall cat people called the Nav'i, who have had their own language created specifically for this movie. Humans have come to Pandora to mine a precious resource that is unique to the planet, but in order to do so they must relocate the Nav'i, which is almost impossible, so the humans have instituted the avatar program. The avatar program is where human scientists mix the DNA of a human with that of a Nav'i in a test tube, resulting in an organically grown humanoid that a human can link their mind into Matrix-style. All of this is unfurled upon the audience within the first thirty minutes or so, and while it all seems a touch too explanatory, it is necessary information needed for the rest of the movie to work.The hero of this story is Jake Sully (likably played by Aussie, Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine who comes to Pandora after his identical twin brother's death to fill his brother's slot in the avatar program. While in his avatar, Jake can run and walk unlike he can as a human. Eventually Jake meets Neytiri, a Nav'i princess (portrayed by Zoe Saldana, who completely disappears into the role). Jake and Neytiri fall in love and Jake begins to embark upon an ordeal to get inducted into Nav'i civilization. All the while, the war-mongering human corporation behind the whole shindig is chomping at the bit to eradicate the Nav'i from the face of the planet in order to mine. This conflict results in Jake having to choose sides between the humans he hails from, and his newfound home with the Nav'i.The story has traces of so many different movies found within. It's ecological message can make you want to compare it to the work of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, where as it's sci-fi/fantasy story of a man crossing over to fight for an alien race can make one think of The Planet of the Apes, not to mention the influences found from our own country's Native American history. Of course, to me Avatar is a wholly original experience. James Cameron should be applauded for attempting something that isn't based upon a book, comic book, or video game. In a way, Avatar is far more thought out and better executed than many movies that are already part of pre-existing properties. What Cameron did here was tell a story that blurs the lines between science fiction and fantasy, much in the way that he blurs the realities between Jake's two worlds.Avatar is many different things, it has romance, action, adventure, and drama. The film has moments of sheer wonderment, and moments that make your heart ache or wanna punch the bad-guy Col. Quaritch, played to perfection by Stephen Lang. That is why Avatar is such a good time at the cinema, because of these moments. Cameron actually took the time within the film to detail the world, to give you a sense of its scope and its scale, and it all adds up to make Avatar a rollicking success.When all is said and done, Avatar is a special time at the cinema. It's one of those movies that has to be experienced again in order to fully drink it all in, but even after one viewing, the film is very much appreciated. Thanks, James Cameron.I give Avatar a 10 out of 10!",positive
991,"I have to admit, I liked Avatar regardless of my perspectives about mainstream productions. It was a great adventure with mixed-stories borrowed from other fables, war movies, but in a visual which is really magical, yet I'm not fond of green-box or any similar things, even if it was basically relying on it in a big picture (So, actually it's more an animation movie then a real-actor motion picture (Like Star wars nowadays).)It's a Visual Movie, with great atmosphere, magical environmental constructions, so there is nothing which would be problem for our eyes (maybe just the not so great contrast between real humans and fantasy surroundings)The Music fitted to the movie, yet it had similar melodies to Apocalypto, and as I was looking for the composer's name, I knew that it's going to be James Horner, 'coz it would be absurd if other composer would steal scores from another great motion pictures(Apocalypto, Troy, Zorro), but it was alright.The Story is based on a classical war-love pattern, which we have seen many-many times in other, lower budget movies, but the whole movie is like a big mix-up with Pocahontas, The Last of the Mohicans, Titanic, Apocalypto, Star Wars, war movies. So, yeah, it's not original, but again, it's a Visual Movie for me, and on that field it's really ... bitchin'.Overall: The presentation is tremendously magical, yet it lacks originality in story background it's a great visual adventure with fascinating fable atmosphere, which we'll never forget.It's like the ol' good Fables in a wider, newer, more modern form...7/10",positive
992,"Few films in the history of special effects, high-octane action thrillers can come close to the cinematic genius of Avatar. This masterful slice of storytelling tracks the explosive action on the planet Pandora.A paraplegic marine is sent in to learn the ways of the local creatures on the planet. For this mission a team of scientists create a genetic being intimately linked to his human form. This Avatar can eat, breathe, sleep and adapt to the harsh conditions on Pandora. But Jake Sully doesn't anticipate what is about to follow and neither does Neytiri - his love interest - of the Na'vi clan.For the humans, it's about stopping at nothing in their quest to mine the rich minerals on Pandora. But this is a sacred world where the creatures are at one with one another and God. With Cameron's direction the heroes of this story take the viewer on a ride of a lifetime in arguably the greatest special effects film of all time. This is true movie genius and Cameron deserves all the praise that is being heaped on him.",positive
993,"Avatar is an interesting movie. On one hand, we got a strange new world, full of unusual, yet strangely compelling creatures, all conjured up in front of our eyes. It's filled with mystique and awe. It's what is currently dazzling the crowds and it's an aspect of Avatar that will likely win it several more awards, which the movie well deserves.On the other hand, if you look beyond the visual effects, you will find a worn-out and utterly predictable plot, static characters with personalities as deep as a teaspoon and dialogs resembling an average daily commute: a necessary evil, that serves it's purpose and slips into obscurity immediately afterward. The entire 2 hours and 41 minutes of the movie does not contain a single surprising turn of events, a single character doing something we wouldn't expect him or her to do shorty after initial introduction and, most painfully, not even a single memorable spoken line.The movie is worth seeing for the special effects - go watch it in 3-D to get most out of it. It can be quite enjoyable, if you immerse yourself into the world and ignore everything else. Don't expect a film of the year, however, that's just a hype. It's more of a postcard of another world, with some events happening in it.",neutral
994,"Someone in my household rented Avatar by James Cameron for $1 via Red Box DVD.Reluctantly, I watched this piece of liberal, tree-hugging subversive, propaganda. I cannot believe that this is the biggest grossing motion picture of all time and that it was nominated for (and won) a plethora of awards.Here's the deal in a nutshell: All Americans/white people are evil and native peoples are good, noble, peaceful, and in tune with nature. Got it?The climactic battle is intended to bring the audience to cheer for those enemies killing US Marines and the traitorous humans who are helping them. Uhhh... go Taliban?The tired, Liberal story of the evil white devils losing their souls as they rape and plunder an innocent world for its mineral wealth is about as cutting edge as a dull baby spoon.And, even as these anti-American propaganda films go, this one is particularly poorly written, directed, acted, and the CGI is unremarkable as well. James Cameron has sunk to a new low - even for James Cameron.The names of things in the movie and the ridiculously transparent ""symbolism"" would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetically treasonous in a time of war.Planet: ""Pandora"" (or ""Pandorum"" - whatever). Are you kidding me? Boy, we opened a real Pandora's box here... Please! Mineral being sought: ""Unobtainium"". Really? So, we are supposed to be surprised when it turns out to be... unobtainable?I could go on with the Pentagon-shaped emblems and Human compound, but I just don't feel like it.Anti-Hero Jake Sully is supposed to be a disabled US Marine but they got the cardboard Sam Worthington to pay him without even the effort of trying to cover his British accent. The cartoon-like ""Kill 'em All"" Marine Colonel Quaritch is played with somnambulism by the obviously Soap-Opera-trained Stephen Lang. It appears he spent all of his prep time in the gym, because it sure wasn't on acting. The greedy corporate stereotype Parker Selfridge (Selfish?!?!) was phoned in by the usually talented Giovanni Ribisi. These actors should be ashamed of themselves. I know: ""Crying all the way to the bank."" But would you betray your country for thirty pieces of silver (even at today's prices)? Oh, that's right: Worthington isn't American, so he doesn't give a rat's rear-end that people will cheer for dead US Marines.Let me guess: This movie was written by brace-faced teenage girls in the Mall, right? If you are a real American, and claim to ""support our troops,"" you would be well-advised to stay away from this movie and anything Cameron does from this point forward. He is a Left- wing traitor to his country and is not even very good at that.",negative
995,"James Cameron apparently wrote a film treatment for this movie back in 1994, which makes sense because it was a couple of years after FernGully: The Last Rainforest came out, which he clearly decided to reshoot in live action, changing a few details here and there and then calling it Avatar.In any case, utilizing the full potential of the talented cast, 3D technology and about 240M dollars, Cameron set a new bar for movies to come.Look, let's get the obvious out of the way: Avatar is a piece of entertainment, designed to be seen in 3D at a movie theatre or at least on a large high-quality TV at home. It is not meant to have an engaging original narrative. It's just a very good ice cream. Just eat your ice cream.The special effects are central to a film like this, and the graphics of Avatar are astonishing. There is hardly a frame where CGI is not present. Will all of it still look realistic a few years from now? Who knows, but it is very impressive at its release. Especially noteworthy are the facial animations, made all the more captivating thanks to all the freaky colours and lighting. Supposedly, new motion capture tech was developed for this movie, and I believe it. I feel like plopping the narrative on an alien planet is cheating a bit, because it gives the artists a card blanche to create beauty that does not exist down here at Earth, but the artists sure did take full advantage of this. Bioluminescent plants fill the screen with glowing colours and freaky animals flop and fly around.The story is of secondary importance in this film. Neither the story nor its participants have much depth. Most of the humans are evil colonists, while the Na'vi aliens are just tall blue humans and very obviously represent a conglomeration of African, Jamaican, Native American and Arabic tribesmen, as stand-ins for all the colonized and oppressed peoples of Earth. Just as an example, the leader of the Na'vi is played by the Native American Wes Studi.The principal plot point that symbolises both the silliness and the emptiness of the plot is the reason for humans to colonize this planet: the mineral they mine called ""unobtanium"". One can't tell if Cameron was trying to be purposefully funny or if this is the actual extent of his imagination and nuance. In any case, he's always had a bit of misanthropist streak to him and it's on full display in the plot.However, the shallow plot is considerably elevated by the performances. Sam Worthington delivers a very believable fish-out-of-water performance. Zoe Saldana is very emotive as the local Na'vi princess. There is a moment when she cries out and I thought Cameron must have hurt her real family for the sake of realism or something, because her crying was chillingly realistic and soul scarring.The trip Avatar takes you on is well worth the price of admission. It's 2009 entertainment at its best. The experience should not be missed, no matter what your taste in movies is. However, I can see how the enjoyment would decrease dramatically for anyone who is watching this on a smaller screen, without 3D, or if they for some reason expected a deeper narrative.",positive
996,This might be the best movie i've seen in years. I just saw it in 3D (in Germany...we did get a head start this time). The movie looks twice as expensive as the very poor Transformers 2 but cost about the same money. OK you get your 'standard' characters but the story is so perfectly told that you forget about that. Cameron didn't even forget to put something in for his old fans (True Lies is all I'm going to say...lol). It's incredible how real the Navi look. The other effects are perfect too. Wow! This movie even beats Peter Jackson's trilogy and i hope there will be more Avatar movies in the not too distant future. I advise all of you to go and see this perfect movie.,positive
997,"Saw this in 3D today - has my thumbs up! The 3D works (even with my vision) and the story, although predictable (I'd figured out the ending by about 20 minutes into the film) was nonetheless very enjoyable and touched me deeply in several scenes.Actually, the film reminded me a lot of two SF stories: Call me Joe by Poul Anderson, and Hothouse by Brian Aldiss. Anyway, the themes are not new, but what is new is the totality of the treatment. Almost all of the action takes place in an alien environment with the Narvi - all of which is computer generated. There is live action footage and characters spliced into this as well, and it is absolutely seamless. Within 10 minutes I was immersed into the environment, and wishing it really existed!With a lot of films of this ilk the plot is a bit simplistic. We don't know much about the corporation exploiting the planet, but we can guess that this is either the same one seen in the Aliens films, or one very similar in operation. Really though the situation mirrors a number of colonial and post-colonial situations in recent history, where local and indigenous populations lost out to overseas interest in their resources.No doubt about who the ""bad guys"" are and this is pretty clear from the trailer. It takes time but you learn about the Narvi over the course of the film and come to understand their culture and religion - a religion that seems to be based on a ""real goddess"" as well. But it's also clear that ultimately the good guys will win, and that the main character will, well you'll see. Suffice it to say that what happens is telegraphed well before it occurs.But even with its predictability, I loved this film. I shall have to see it again, without the 3D,to see if that makes a difference.",positive
998,"Ever see a group of people NOT leave their seats, NOT text, NOT talk for three hours for fear of missing something? You will if you go so this movie.An AMAZING film! 10/10 easily one of the best movie experiences you will ever have. You will be telling your grandkids about this one.The rating system on this site is ridiculous though. At the time I am writing this, 10% of the votes cast are 1/10? Obviously people who hate Cameron and DID NOT see the movie. No one who sees this movie would ever give it below a 8. The IMDb staff are idiots as well. 5/10? Really? It's worse than Meatballs 2? Idiots. Another group of Cameron haters. I thought ratings were supposed to be about the film itself and not peoples' opinion of the director.Anyway, haters, it won't work. You can gather up and all give it a 1/10 and real audiences will ignore your fake votes and see it because it's truly stunning. I saw Star Wars when it was new at the theater and sitting there you could tell that film would never be the same. That's the exact feeling you will get when you see this movie. Cameron has changed the art form.Haters, I see you! (you won't get the reference because you didn't actually pay $10 to see a movie by a director you hate...your votes are fake)",positive
999,"OK, OK, 3D will change the way blockbusters are made and we'll be worse of for it.

I kept thinking ""Luke, use the Force!"" And the final battle with Darth Vader, Come on! Wasn't he supposed to wear black? If you set out to make the best movie of all time, shouldn't you come up with at least one new idea? Go for the special effects, but don't expect a good story, it's not here.I don't doubt that this film will garner a load of awards, so look out for a boat load of imitators.Hey, wait a minute, Titanic 3D, what a great idea!",neutral
